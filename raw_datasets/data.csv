I need to put my 19yo cat down and don't know how ...,"My almost 19 yo female cat Tugui is on her last legs. She's been with me since I was 8, everything I've been through she was there when i got home.
5 year ago she was diagnosed with kidney insufficiency and had been doing good with treatment, but as of earlier this week she took a downturn and when the vet did an eco yesterday we found that her kidneys are basically non functional, also her liver is shutting down and she's starting to have trouble breathing. Her most important person in the world was my brother but hes away and can't make it back until tonight. I'm not sure she has that long. I don't want her to be in pain, but a part of me also can't let her go. 
This last year has been shit, I lost another cat my grandma and then had ro put another one to sleep. But aside from my grandma this cat had been always a constant in my life. She's my everything... Do I wait for tomorrow and let my brother get back? I don't want her to suffer but I don't know how to let her go. What do I do?",2024-04-19 19:34:30

Eight month old German Shepherd Male,"Im making this post to ask basic questions from training to behavior, I understand that every dog different in the sense that they don't all act the same what might work for person's dog might not work for a other person's dog. Currently some problems we are facing at the moment he barks at other dogs when going out for walks, he eats things off the ground, he tugs on the leash Ive watched a couple of videos on YouTube for basic stuff like leash pulling. I've bought the prong collar and recently bought a stock collar off amazon for $50.00 his pretty hard to train in the sense that he'll get frustrated like ""I'm doing what you want give the treat already"" I bought a clicker but that went out the window when I clicked it with no treat. He jumps on the bed, he as his own bed and crate. ",2024-04-19 16:18:23

How to make a cat more friendly?,"Hey ppl!
I picked up a cat from a shelter like a 8 month ago. She was quite aggressive towards any other human. She was running away from me around the apartment and bit everyone who wanted to touch her.
Currently I managed to make her more calm, I play with her with toys, I feed her from my hands via cat snacks and she sometimes comes to me and sits nearby me. She still doesn’t allow to touch her and run away to her hide spot every time.
Do you know any steps I can do to make her not afraid of my touch ?",2024-04-19 15:10:10

Neutering vs stairs. What do I do?,"I am getting my dog neutered in a couple months but the problem is that to enter my house you have to descend two flights of stairs, and obviously, to leave, you have to go back up them. Everything I’m reading online says to avoid stairs for the first few days and to keep them inside unless it’s for potty breaks. Well for potty breaks he must go outside so he must go up the stairs. So what do I do? Is he really not going to be able to use the stairs? Or will it be okay? Will he be able to go up and down a ramp with a relatively steep incline? Maybe like a 45-50 degree incline? Also he gets very excited to go outside how do I keep him calm and not jump around? Any advice would be greatly appreciated please",2024-04-19 14:13:58

"I cant decide whether to get a gerbil, ferret, rat, or chinchilla","For some context, I will be a senior in college next year hoping to get a pet for mental health purposes 

I'll have a single in an apartment style dorm and space doesn't really matter to me. I would replace my bed with a cage if it made my animal happier. Also, price for the habitat I'm willing to invest in, but I really need to keep monthly costs and health expenses in mind, especially as a full time student who's only income is babysitting. From what I've read so far, the larger creatures would cost more on both ends, which makes sense. Plus, most of these guys need a friend so Id need to double the budget. 

Ideally, I want a playful pet who typically likes humans and being handled. I do need to keep in mind smell and mischievousness since I have roommates, which I know may make ferrets a bad choice (BUT I WANT ONE SO BAD) and I'm more than willing to put in the work to keep that stuff at bay if possible. 

I know getting a pet my last year of college may seem like a bad decision, but I just can't live without an animal around and I miss my babies back home so much and that responsibility of taking care of another living thing makes me so so so so so happy, so...

If you have any advice, life experience, or input of any kind about this, I'd really love to hear it!",2024-04-19 13:13:16

Cat owner- Advice needed,"I have two cats-  the boy bullies the girl, and the girl has someone interested to adopt her. I’m scared that if I have her adopted HE won’t be able to handle being alone. He is an extremely needy cat who hates being alone but also is attention seeking and likes to be the one to control the situation. He doesn’t “hurt” her but he stresses her out. Please advise if I should have her adopted. I don’t know what to do.   ",2024-04-19 12:07:08

Vet seems to require prescription dose consistency perfection from pet and I,"I called to refill medicine for an old cat. When they asked if I've been giving her the dosage consistently, I said yes but it's not perfect because the pet doesn't always eat it and I'm not always home or someone isn't always able to be there. The woman on the phone hesitated and started typing, then said they may not be able to refill if I'm not dosing consistently. I'm not sure she understood the difference between consistently and perfectly.

Since they said it's lifetime prescription, I don't understand why they would deny the pet the medicine if we can't do perfect doses every single time. When it's been less consistent, she's gone back downhill. When it's more consistent, she improves. She doesn't need perfection to improve.

Stopping the dosage completely will probably be her undoing. I do my best and said that but the woman acted like that wasn't good enough. Hopefully the vet won't deny the prescription because it can't be perfect, and will let us do our best after another check-up. I don't have a perfectly healthy diet all the time but if I was denied good food then I would waste away quickly. I almost feel like I'm supposed to lie just to help my pet.",2024-04-19 10:26:20

What else can I do for this neglected(?) dog?,"TW neglect

My neighbors are what you could call sketchy, even though we live in a nice neighborhood. Their entire backyard is filled with hoarding junk to where you can't walk in it, and their front yard is filled with broken down cars that haven't moved since I moved next door a few years ago. We get along relatively fine, but do not know each other's names or numbers like I do with my other set of neighbors.

Last year around this time, they had a large pitbull on a stake that sat outside barking all day and howling all night no matter the weather. I could see through the cracks that it had no access to water or shelter. I called for a welfare check, and two days later the dog was gone and has never been seen again.

A month ago, these same neighbors got a puppy. It is gorgeous, probably 16 weeks old. This puppy sits outside most of the day with its leash wrapped around a 25lb dumbell. There is no accessible water or cover from the hot southern sun. They have brought this dog inside when it rains though, which they did not do for the previous dog.

Today was my breaking point. While I was walking my dogs with a friend, I noticed the puppy had pulled the dumbbell into a deep ditch and was stuck there. We gave the neighbor some time to hear their yelping dog as we looped the neighborood, but 25 minutes later it was still stuck in the ditch. So, even though legally I should not have, I pulled the puppy back into the yard with it's dumbbell, where it has been for the last 3 hours.

I decided I would call another welfare check. When the cop left after being there for less than five minutes, he called me and said ""I told her she needs to get a heavier dumbbell."" The puppy is still out their barking its little heart out.

This has really upset me, this is no quality of life for this animal. I don't know what else I can do. I can't dognap it and bring it to the shelter, I don't think I can call the shelter to get it if the sheriff's department already said it is okay and to ""get a heavier dumbbell."" I am too nervous to speak to the neighbor as one of them does have a criminal history related to an aggressive offense.

I feel guilty doing nothing for this poor baby who clearly just wants to play. I know it is a hard situation, but does anyone have any advice for what can be done?",2024-04-19 09:01:49

What cat food does your cat love?,"My two cats are 2 (M) and 3 (F), I currently feed them a diet consisting of Instinct Chicken dry food and Science Hill’s Turkey & Liver wet food. They have been eating this for months now and I think they’re getting bored of it.

What is considered too much?,"I’ve always had dogs, cats, and many aquatic animals growing up. Then my dad (I have divorced parents) moved to a plot of land and had cows, chickens, donkeys, goats, pigs, etc. you get the point. A whole farm. 

My family at points have had birds, a literal flying squirrel (I was too young to remember this) and I had a friend in high school who loved exotic animals so he had a pet lemur and many other creatures.

Add all of this to the idea that about three years ago I started getting into wanting a chameleon and little rodents. I also SWEAR I will have a monkey at some point in my life. Oh, and I have LOTS of houseplants. I really enjoy nurturing and loving on all kinds. 

My boyfriend on the other hand has ONE dog. ONE. He loves my cats and plants and I’ve halfway moved in at this point. My cats are always there, he now has his own plants and we’ve been starting an aquarium at his house. He knows I want chickens and a goat for eggs and milk but idk how I’m gonna go about getting him on a plot of land with tons of animals and plants. Or even getting him into the idea of an aquarium wall or an exotic animal room. This is rough. 

I’m not looking for advice and I’m honestly not being serious about pushing him into it if he doesn’t want to. I’ll survive without a million pets, although I do love the idea of what I’ve stated. I just wanted to post and see if anyone else was in this sort of situation.

My boyfriend loves the creativity and is super supportive of everything I love and want. But when will he think I’m crazy and want too much?! LOL",2024-04-19 07:01:16

Food Motivated Cat Suddenly Not Eating,"Hi, our 6 month old male cat has always been extremely food motivated, to the point of us having to lock him in a room while we prepare his dinner. He also usually drinks a ton of water. More than any cat I’ve ever seen. Today, he hasn’t touched any of his meals or water. He also gagged at the smell of his favorite wet food when we presented it to him. We have offered dry kibble, hydrated kibble and wet food. I did get him to eat a single piece of a treat at the vet. He’s been sleeping all day (more than usual) and mildly lethargic. There are minor changes to his behavior that are so minute you’d never notice unless you WFH like us and play Cat Watch all day. I took him to the vet and he had a temperature of 104°F.  Bloodwork came back clean and they sent us home. He’s my baby and I’m worried. Please help.",2024-04-19 07:00:25

When is it time to say goodbye to my best friend?,"I had my dog since I was a little kid (9). Now I'm 21 and she's 12.

Unfortunatelly she was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer. Since december we've been taking care of her. Taking her on walks, feeding her.

She was bleeding a lot and today she had diarrhea and didn't even eat her favorite meal. It's pretty soon to say, tomorrow she may eat again (that's what i'm hoping for). But then again, things could get worse and to see my best friend in those circumstances is heart-breaking. I can't stop crying. But I want what's best for her. When will I know? Will she give me a clear sign?",2024-04-19 07:00:14

Mast cell tumors ,"Earlier this week my dog had a bump basically in his armpit, and he’s had two mast cell tumors before but also some lipomas. However this one basically grew overnight and I called the vet Tuesday morning to be seen. Because of his history he got in right away and we got a biopsy done. I just got off the phone with the vet and it’s a mast cell tumor again. 

My dogs about approximately 10, 35 lbs schnauzer mix and he’s very spry and overall healthy so we are going to get it removed. But my question for others is, what are your experiences with MCT’s? I know once a dog has one they are bound to come back, but do they increase in frequency? At what point do I say enough is enough? I want him to live as long as he can but I know the surgical removal is tough on his little body. If anyone has any holistic solutions I’d love to hear too.

So a little backstory, My dad actually accidentally kicked her today trying to separate her from our male cat who was trying to mount her and I think she ran away because of this. She's not in the parking lot or neighbor's house and she's not crying. It also started to rain and there’s a power outage and mobile flash isn’t enough not to mention she has an infection too. I'm worried sick and I kinda blame it on my dad.I'll wait till morning and then look for her but how should I cope with the losing my first pet I have a strong attachment with her. Please anyone with similar experience help me.",2024-04-19 04:26:09

My roommate picked up a stray dog,"I just went back from a vacation and when I went back to my dorm, my roommate adopted a stray dog. The seems to hate me and shit in everyplace I go. LITERALLY!

Moreover, today he seemed to have a nightmare and he fuckin growls and barks at me even though I did nothing. I was  at the bathroom minding my own business when suddenly I heard that dog growls and woke up from his sleep which might be him having a nightmare. Then I quickly took a bath and went back to my desk to play my games where I found that stupid dog.

I only managed to make him stop by waking up my room mate to chill him out.

Are you responsible for pets that you don't own?,"EDIT 2: Got a lot of wide perspectives and all that and I appreciate it and feel like I know what to do now so I'm going to delete this post at some point I think

IMPORTANT EDIT: (please read if you're about to comment): I talked to my parents and they feed the dogs and give them water daily but apparently haven't taken them out on a walk in a little while due to the dogs having health issues at the moment and they worry it would like, be dangerous for them to be outside, they've been taken to the vet recently for it. Is that properly taken care of? I hope it is

Posting here since AITA doesn't allow non inter-personal conflicts so I want to ask the pet guys about their thoughts on this pet related topic, I originally posted it here but removed it while it was still being  reviewed to post it there but now I'm back here

I'm curious about this question as it's been on my mind lately, if like someone you live with buys a pet, your parents, a roommate, or anyone else, you didn't ask for it nor did you pay for it is it your responsibility in any capacity? What if you have a fairly busy life yourself like if you're a college/university student and feel like you don't have the energy or time to bother so you wouldn't have bought one yourself in the first place and don't want the mental health burden that is taking care of another creature when you have many other responsibilities yourself?

It's a different case imo from buying one when you can't handle it yourself since that's you being irresponsible. Genuinely want to see what people think about this topic since it's been on my mind in my own life lately since my family have 2 dogs and I haven't really inquired to my family as to how they're taking care of them or anything and just presume they're doing a good job, nor do I spend much time with them outside of when I see them in the kitchen and pet them and stuff and give them treats sometimes, usually busy thinking about university work or enjoying the little free time I get lately, it's nearing the end of the year so it's gotten particularly brutal.

Also how would the situation change if you were to move out and no longer live with your family but they still own the pet?

Just ftr I wont be defensive over the answer",2024-04-19 03:18:22

Genuinely want to see what people think about this topic since it's been on my mind in my own life lately since my family have 2 dogs and I haven't really inquired to my family as to how they're taking care of them or anything and just presume they're doing a good job, nor do I spend much time with them outside of when I see them in the kitchen and pet them and stuff and give them treats sometimes, usually busy thinking about university work or enjoying the little free time I get lately, it's nearing the end of the year so it's gotten particularly brutal.

Also how would the situation change if you were to move out and no longer live with your family but they still own the pet?

Just ftr I wont be defensive over the answer",2024-04-19 03:18:22
Are you responsible for pets that you don't own?,"EDIT 2: Got a lot of wide perspectives and all that and I appreciate it and feel like I know what to do now so I'm going to delete this post at some point I think

IMPORTANT EDIT: (please read if you're about to comment): I talked to my parents and they feed the dogs and give them water daily but apparently haven't taken them out on a walk in a little while due to the dogs having health issues at the moment and they worry it would like, be dangerous for them to be outside, they've been taken to the vet recently for it. Is that properly taken care of? I hope it is

Posting here since AITA doesn't allow non inter-personal conflicts so I want to ask the pet guys about their thoughts on this pet related topic, I originally posted it here but removed it while it was still being  reviewed to post it there but now I'm back here

I'm curious about this question as it's been on my mind lately, if like someone you live with buys a pet, your parents, a roommate, or anyone else, you didn't ask for it nor did you pay for it is it your responsibility in any capacity? What if you have a fairly busy life yourself like if you're a college/university student and feel like you don't have the energy or time to bother so you wouldn't have bought one yourself in the first place and don't want the mental health burden that is taking care of another creature when you have many other responsibilities yourself?

random agression,"hi all, I’m looking for advice on an aggressive incident
we have 4 pets, 2 cats (both rescues, 1 female, 1 male), and 2 dogs (1 female, 1 male)
male cat has been fixed for years and is the oldest, female cat was fixed roughly a month ago and is the youngest but they have lived together for 2 years now 
last weekend, our dogs barked at something, cats alerted, dogs calm down, cat fight starts
our female cat attacked the male cat and would not stop, she’s peeing while attacking, male cat manages to hide and she starts attacking the male dog (who is her favorite)
we finally coral her to a cage, and take her to the vet on monday
vet says, either she had the equivalent to a mental breakdown or there’s ovarian tissue still somewhere inside
after the spay surgery, she started hoarding 4-6 dog toys as if they were her kittens and would lick them and sleep with them, she did this up until the day of the incident
they had us get calming diffusers and calming treats and see if that helps before they want to test for hormones and operate again
we have them separated right now but just the sight of the male cat makes her angry and start growling
I’m wondering if it is possible she had a mental break? or is this likely something medical? do I try to wait out to see if the calming diffusers help? it seems like such a short term solution and it’s a stressful situation for everyone in the house ",2024-04-19 02:49:01

Experience with Lemonade pet insurance payout?,"I have Lemonade pet insurance for my dogs. 2.5 weeks ago, they both got into rat poison and had to be hospitalized. My one dog was able to come home after 5 days but racked up $6000 worth of bills, and my second is still hospitalized and up to $13,000. They both have coverage up to $20,000. 
I submitted the claim for my first dog after she came home almost 2 weeks ago and it is still under review. Her smaller claims for follow up appointments have already been approved.
It says right on the policy that poisonings are covered, but I’m starting to get anxious that for some reason my claim will be denied or that it won’t be paid out for a while. 
Does anyone have experience with filing a claim with them for a poisoning or for a high cost incident? How long did it take for your claim to be approved and to be paid out?",2024-04-19 02:22:32

I would need opinions about pet insurance and pet visits,"If I made any mistakes writing this, English is my third language if there are any questions, I will happily answer them in the comments.

Hello everyone

I recently moved from Europe, Croatia to America, Washington Seattle and I have taken my dog with me. There have been allergies circling around, and I believe my dog got affected by it and my partner and I were looking into getting pet insurance. Pet insurance dont exist in my country and the cost to go to the vet is under 100 bucks depending on the emergency but it’s not as expensive as it is here. From our research, we noticed that there is a lot of pet insurance that don’t cover the vet check ups. We were wondering if there any insurance that have everything included. We know that when there’s an already existing illness, the insurance will not cover it so if you have any suggestions on how to go around that, it would be amazing. We appreciate any opinion and suggestion. 

Thank you!",2024-04-19 00:43:28

"My dog stepped on my cat, my cat now keeps attacking my dog and my dog can’t calm down","Papi (6M Cat) Dallas (8F Dog) Pompom (1F Cat)

I’m at a complete loss of what to do here. I’ve had my cat for 5 years, legitimately the most sweetest loving boy. He has never shown aggression towards any animal, including dogs. 

So I found the cutest dog ever as a stray one cold winter freeze night. Cleaned her up and she’s been with us for months now! Papi has had no issues with her what so ever. He routinely gives her head nudges and kisses, with aggressive butthole sniffs. 

We’re all living one happy family at this point. 

I’m walking one night around my neighborhood, and this little stray orange kitten runs up to me, chirping for food. My heart melts, I run back in quickly to grab some food hoping she doesn’t leave, and she never left. As a matter of fact, she waltzed right into my house. She’s definitely not anyone’s cat, she eats like a stray and she’s extremely skittish towards anyone but me. 

I keep Papi and Pompom in separate rooms for a while, slowly introducing each other at a distance during feeding times. Papi has 0 aggression towards her, but she being a feral was afraid of him for a little while until eventually she got over it. Papi and Pompom would nip at each other and play, but Pompom is an extremely loving cat as well and loves human attention which started getting Papi jealous.

If Papi were to attack Pompom he would stand 0 chance, and he knows this. However Dallas.. her nick name is ditzy Dallas, because she’s always running circles and running into things. Well this particular morning, Papi was feeling stressed because Pompom keeps invading his private spaces. So I started separate spaces again, but this particular morning ditzy Dallas decided to trample over Papi when she was running full speed to come see what I was doing in the toilet. 

Papi went full rage mode. I’ve never even seen this side of him before. He went full throttle on her and I had to separate the fight, he wouldn’t give up either. Then he goes back to normal, but for some reason whenever Dallas gets close he goes into attack mode. It happened 3 more times, and Dallas is now so panicking and afraid she won’t even eat. Papi shows no aggression towards anything else. I have to keep them in separate rooms because Papi would just glare at her relentlessly until he gets a whiff of fear and attack. 

Dallas is not doing well.. she just panics and hides all day long. She won’t eat, she just hides her food. The fear she has causes her to act crazy and run around, spin around, jump on everything which completely freaks Papi out even more making him want to attack her constantly. I don’t know how to get Papi to stop trying to murder her for her fear.",2024-04-19 00:07:30

Could Dog be Acting Like this because of Opoid Injection or because of Pancreatitis?,"I've been wanting to take my dog to the vet for awhile just because hes old (9 years) to get a checkup. The day before yesterday he started vomiting white bile all over for about an hour so yesterday I brought him in. 
Yesterday he was eating and energetic and wanted to go for a walk- i took him on a regular walk and a walk at the vet while we were waiting.
At the vet he was diagnosed with pancreatitis and the vet said he could probably go home and go on a low fat diet and gave him a shot of opoid for pain
Now today my dog is weak and cant even walk down the stairs and is drooling (hes an australian shepherd). He also wont eat at all. The vet said it might be the opoid and that it could last 3 days, but i googled it and everywhere it said it should only last 24 hours at the most, so what is the vet talking about?
I cant get him to eat and they said this could be fatal but theres nothing i can do. He just wants to sleep. I don't think hes going to make it. We already spend 1200 and any more treatments probably wont bring him through

how do i remove lice from bird food. ,"
i'm in UAE and it rained a ton, no new supplies are going to be coming in stores for a few days to a week. i live in an area which is accessible thru main roads/ highways and they're all blocked and full of water. 

i feed them another brand that's a little more expensive and comes in smaller amount, but i have 10 kgs of bird food that i don't use bc there's lice in it. i've had that food for a month or two by now, and i kept it outside in a metal box thats airtight. 

i looked in it today and i saw some dead lice, i still won't feed that bird food to them because i need to make sure they're *all* dead. is there a way to save this seed? it's so much, and the expensive food we have rn is gonna finish. 

the birds do live outside (they're doing fine, in fact they just took a bath in that storm🤷‍♀️), so they can find a small amount of food on their own but it's not gonna cut it. ",2024-04-18 15:55:38

Sudden Paralysis in Young Dog,"I'm posting this for my parents dog. I don't live there anymore, so I'm just relaying what I've heard or seen.

My parents have a two year old, female cocker spaniel named Macy. Macy is overweight, but healthy otherwise.
On Sunday, my dad let Macy and their other dog outside in the fenced in backyard for an hour. When he went to let them in, Macy was laying on the garage floor and couldn't get up. She wasn't crying in pain or showing any other signs of discomfort, she just couldn't support her weight. My dad said she was also just super rigid, like all her muscles were contracting.
We aren't sure if her and the other dog were playing and she got injured (slipped disc or nerve injury?) or something else. She had no symptoms prior to this, so we're thinking she had some injury.

My dad took Macy to the vet and the Dr couldn't find any issues with her. He didn't take an Xray or do bloodwork. Macy was able to sit up and support herself a bit with her front legs. He didn't think it was a stroke due to how her eyes seemed. He gave Macy a steroid shot and anti inflammatory shot. He sent my dad home with steroid and antibiotic pills to give her daily and told him to come back in three weeks.

It's been 3 days and now both her front and back legs aren't working. She's been eating and drinking ok. I'm not sure how much control of her bladder and bowels she has. She's been laying on a pillow with a puppy pad underneath. 
When my gf and I went to see her today, she was acting super excited and tried rolling and scooting over to us. She would try to get up, but she can't get her legs underneath her to support herself. She tires herself out quickly and lays still for a long time after.
She urinated a lot and when I went to clean her back legs, she would occasionally react and pull them back. She still has sensation in her limbs and muscle tone.

I'm trying to get an idea of what may have happened or see if anyone went through something similar.
I've asked my parents to get a second opinion, because I've had bad experiences with that vet and he mostly deals with livestock.",2024-04-18 12:44:43

Sudden paralysis in dog,"I have a 10.5 year old, sweet as can be, German shepherd female dog that has struggled with arthritis in her backside since she was about 6. Slow decline since then and we have had both ups and downs with all the various things we have tried to treat. For a bulk of her arthritic time she has been on rymadyl, amantadine, and pregabalin but we stopped that about 4 months ago because she started Librela injections and saw wonderful improvement! 

On the side we do CBD oil, PT, water treadmill, laser treatment, massage, and she has a wheelchair for walks as needed. 

Anywho, 5 days ago we went on a drive for about 1.5 hours. Drives have made her anxious lately. She pushed her way through our barrier to get closer to us. When we arrived at our destination and took her out of the car she was unable to walk and use her hind legs. Curling her toes, army crawling across the floor, falling, etc. The change was dramatic and sudden. Prior to the car ride she couldn’t jump up on things and would occasionally fall or get off balance on slick floors but nothing like this. She did not present in any pain but we arrived late at night and went directly to bed. 

I took her the ER vet, originally they thought it was IVDD, however her lack of pain made them rule that out. Then they thought DM (degenerative myelopathy) but that doesn’t explain the sudden issue with paralysis. Additionally, I’ve heard of DM and DM comes on sudden and declines over a year time, my dog has declined over 5-6 years. My own research has made me wonder if she has FCE (fibrocartilaginous embolism, aka spinal stroke).

We are currently treating with adding all her prior meds back and rest. 

Doctors said they could get more answers through MRI, but that requires anesthesia which at her age makes me nervous. (I’d rather lose her on my terms, in my presence) And even with an MRI, the treatment answer for most suspected diagnosis is surgery, which I am also very hesitant about. I have tried to see if vets would do an MRI with sedation, not anesthesia, but have had no luck. 

I would say in the past 5 or so days my dog has had maybe a HAIRLINE improvement, but I am helping her get to and from place to place, she can sometimes do it on her own when I’m not looking or around but I’m unsure what that looks like. She does have pain sensation in her paws, but her reaction is a little delayed. She is still eating, using the restroom as normal (with support walking). She is tired (trazedone) but happy and moved quicker than I can manage sometimes. 

Has anyone experienced anything remotely similar? How did you support? Any information is great but please be gentle as this has been a very hard time for me to see her struggle and I’m not ready to lose her. Thank you for taking the time to read this and support us! ",2024-04-18 11:22:22

stubborn old cat refuses to use a different box,"﻿﻿My cat is 14.  She is a Manx.  She has had a fragile bladder for much of her life.  Now she is old and being a stubborn little brat about where she pees.  We tried switching back to worlds best car litter like when she was younger.  She won't touch it.  Tried pretty litter.  She will only poop in it.  Tried cat attract and set up a second box next to the pretty litter box.  Finally success!

  
However, that's in the basement and she spends much of her time on the main floor. She has to climb down the stairs to the basement to use those boxes but she keeps having accidents on the stairs.  She can't use the stairs on a full bladder.  She's just too old. So I tried putting cat attract in the fresh litter on the main floor litter box.  She still won't touch it.

She's stubborn.

What can I do to convince her to use that damn box so she can stop peeing on the stairs? She has thyroid medicine she gets twice a day.  I bathed the piss stink off of her yesterday and she's still weak from fighting me with everything she had in that bath but she's otherwise fine.  She climbs her cat tree without trouble, shreds up her cardboard, eats her wet food almost exclusively, ignoring dry food for the most part. Doesn't seem to drink much water anymore but eagerly laps up meat juices from her food packets.  She doesn't seem to be in pain so I don't think it's time to put her to sleep.

stubborn old cat refuses to use a different box,"﻿﻿My cat is 14.  She is a Manx.  She has had a fragile bladder for much of her life.  Now she is old and being a stubborn little brat about where she pees.  We tried switching back to worlds best car litter like when she was younger.  She won't touch it.  Tried pretty litter.  She will only poop in it.  Tried cat attract and set up a second box next to the pretty litter box.  Finally success!

  
However, that's in the basement and she spends much of her time on the main floor. She has to climb down the stairs to the basement to use those boxes but she keeps having accidents on the stairs.  She can't use the stairs on a full bladder.  She's just too old. So I tried putting cat attract in the fresh litter on the main floor litter box.  She still won't touch it.

She's stubborn.

Considering helping out a stray dog near my work place - what are my steps?,"There's a stray dog near my workplace that I've been tracking for the past few months. I'm surprised it is still around given the amount of dead animals here, but it seems well-adjusted.  I want to help it, but I don't know what steps to take.

I was eating my lunch in my car this morning and I spotted it lounging in a hidden grassy median area between a road and a highway and my heart melted while watching it run around and essentially entertain itself. This is after months of spotting it in various spots within a mile radius at random.

I'm no stranger to dogs but if I were to somehow manage to find a way and time to get the dog into my car, what are the next steps to getting it cleaned up and healthy? I am not sure I want to keep it, but the dog is semi-known via the nearby university subreddit, so I could also reach out to people for adoption, but I would need to take some initiative as far as getting the dog healthy before doing any outreach, I assume.",2024-04-18 08:30:15

Can my friend take her cat to the vet with no legal or vet records?,"Hi asking for a friend here. Her roommate has had her cat for two years it was purchased for her as a kitten by a relative she is no longer in contact with and who has refused to send the proof of purchase from the breeder. The roommate says she can't contact the breeder because all she knows about them is that they are in Russia and that her relative bought the cat and had it put on a plane and brought to the US. The roommate no longer lives in the same state as the relative who purchased the cat. But has been the sole caregiver of the cat for the past 2 years. 

We don't believe the cat is microchipped but we aren't 100% sure. We do know the cat hasn't been spayed and has never been to the vet. 

The roommate is scared to take the cat to the vet because she is worried they will take the cat away from her (the cat is well cared for but she has no legal proof of ownership and no vet records) or possibly contact the relative who purchased the cat (which would reveal to the relative what state the roommate lives in which could be possibly dangerous) She is scared to take the cat to the vet and claim its a stray she found and wants to keep because she thinks the vet would take the cat and refuse to give it back and will possibly check for a microchip. 

We want to know if there is any way she can take the cat to the vet and have her vaccinated and spayed without any vet records or legal documents. And while at the vet if she can get proof of ownership without an adoption record or proof of purchase. The cat has had no vaccinations and is unspayed (but kept indoors at all times). 

We've been stressing to her that she needs to get the cat spayed. But she's too scared to she really loves this cat. Is there anything she can do Reddit? we are in the US. ",2024-04-18 07:29:08

Is a follow-up Urinalysis recommended for my male cat?,"Late last week I noticed that my 2 year old male cat seemed to be in pain when trying to pee, as he let out a painful sounding meow while in the litter-box. He was still able to pee a normal amount, and showed no other symptoms, but I was concerned and called a vet to be safe.

I took him in for his appointment this past Monday and they found he had a bladder infection, so they prescribed 7 days worth of antibiotics for him. I asked the vet if I should bring him back for a follow-up urinalysis after the antibiotics were done, but they seemed insistent that it shouldn’t be necessary.

The thing that has me worried is that I’m going to be travelling out of the country for a couple weeks at the start of May, and my girlfriend will be stopping by twice a day to take care of the little guy while I’m gone. It scares me that I won’t be around if something were to pop up again. I would prefer not to spend another $400 on a test if the vet doesn’t think it’s necessary, but I’m considering doing it anyways for my own peace of mind.

He’s been taking his medication well since Monday evening, but he just seemed to be in some pain again in the litter-box a moment ago. It’s only been a day and a half so maybe that’s to be expected still?

So what do you think - if his pain clears up by the time he gets through his medication, should I bring him in for a follow up test? Or is that generally not necessary? He’s my first cat so I’m new to all of this. Thanks in advance.",2024-04-18 05:23:57

I’m looking for one that’s the size of your standard litter box and I want it to be uncovered or just no wider than like 1.5ft as it has to go in my tiny laundry area next to a stackable W&D. a litter robot won’t fit. No budget just looking for one that is the right size and works well! TIA! ",2024-04-18 04:29:04

Dog ate chocolate,"Hi. My 4 year old German Shepherd ate a 4 oz cup of chocolate chips. Last time those chips were out was around 6 AM, came home to find the cup empty around 3-4 PM (EST my time). He’s around 110-112 pounds and hasn’t shown any signs/symptoms of chocolate poisoning as far as I’m aware. But the unfortunate part is I don’t have the money to take him to the vet for treatment. Will he be OK? Is there any other form of treatment that I could do to help my dog?

Edit: I forgot to mention that this is not milk chocolate; it’s semisweet chocolate chips.",2024-04-18 04:18:31

Is it okay for my cat to live outside?,"8 years ago my cat arrived as a kitten into our backyard. We don't know exactly how because is enclosed by walls but he did. We decided to give him into adoption but after 3 months of no luck we ended up taking care of him.

The thing is he doesnt like to be inside, even though we tried many many times he cant be inside for more than 30 minutes before wanting to get out and meowing and crying constantly. So we built him a house in our backyard and he stays in there most of the time and occasionally he likes to get inside for a few moments. 

Currently a friend told me is very dangerous for the cat to be outside. But since he really doesnt go outside the backyard much and hasnt for the last 8 years I dont see a problem with it specially if he doesnt like staying inside. So I'd like some opinions about this,  specially as he is getting old and less active. How could I get him to live inside without him hating it.

I don't want to euthanize my cat but I've exhausted all options. Last ditch effort for ideas.,"My cat is 14 years old and I've had him since he was 6 weeks old and rescued from a ditch. I love him and his sister more than anything, they have been my babies for most of my adult life. He has always had issues with not using the litterbox but it has gotten much much worse over the past few years. He's been to the vet multiple times and no health issues have ever been detected. I've tried Prozac, anti-stress diffusers, every type of litter, cat repellant spray, cat attractant spray, change in diet, water fountain, and he has four litter boxes which are cleaned daily. I tried making him an outdoor cat last year, got a very sturdy insulated raised shelter and set it up under an awning with a cat tower and chair for me to visit with him. He HATED it, I cried every time I had to go back inside and he would try to follow me. Then he got in a fight with a feral cat and got a huge gash on his chest so I moved him back inside. Not one day goes by that he doesn't pee or poop somewhere in my house, I have a labyrinth of gates blocking different areas and have to stay constantly vigilant of him sneaking in to pee on stuff I cannot replace. I mostly just try to keep him in areas where the stuff he pees and poops on is more easily replaceable but its still hundreds of dollars a month to replace pillows, towels, blankets, rugs, plants, dog toys, not to mention all the cleaning products. I considered rehoming or a barn cat rescue but so far I can't find one that will take him and the fact that he is older, HATES other cats, isn't particularly friendly to any other people besides me, and has minimal survival skills makes me worried that it would actually be a fate worse than death for him. 

I do not want to put him down but I cannot handle this stress anymore - its affecting my job, my relationship, my bank account, and my feelings towards my sweet baby boy. I guess I'm just hoping that if I put this on the internet someone will have an idea that I haven't thought of yet. ",2024-04-18 03:28:41

Dog Separation Anxiety,"My 4 year old Stacy Chow mix has suffered from separation anxiety since we rescued her as a 5 month old puppy. The severity of it goes up and down and we do give her trazadone when we leave for an extended amount of time (6 hours). This has obviously been very taxing and am looking for other possible solutions to limit the barking. We have tried crate training but this has not worked as she legitimately broke out of her crate at about a year and I am afraid of her hurting herself. She is totally fine when she is left at my parents who have a house as this only seems to be an issue in my apartment. She gets plenty of exercise, over a mile walk a day and we play with tennis balls or tug ropes later.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",2024-04-18 03:02:49

Dog's Nationwide policy up for renewal. Considering switching. Advice?,"My sweet mutt just turned 4. When I got him as a puppy, I got him on a Nationwide pet insurance policy for peace of mind.

We take him for an annual wellness exam, and he's had maybe 3 visits for acute injuries/illness. No pre-existing conditions or medication other than the standard heartworm/tick preventive.

Nationwide policy is renewing for a $100 increase, so about $400 with a $250 annual deductible. We pay out of pocket for annual visits and preventive medications. 

I've found it really easy to upload vet transcripts for claims, but have yet to reach the deductible, so I don't yet know if they fight you over payouts.

Since this is a big hike for a fairly young, healthy dog, I'm considering switching policy providers. As he has no pre-existing conditions, it might be an opportune time.

What would you do? What providers have you had good experiences with?",2024-04-18 01:47:06

Do you defend your dog against other people’s insults and why? ,"My dog barks at people he doesn't like, probably out of fear (i.e. insecurity). He's a Maltese. I walk my dog on a 1.5 meter leash because he's so small and I can control his bad behavior better.

Suddenly paralyzed dog,"Just need support and advice, and not sure where to turn.

My 13 rat terrier struggled to get downstairs on Sunday night to go out, and wouldn’t get out of bed Monday morning. When I lifted him onto the floor it seems like his back legs were more or less paralyzed. 

Immediately brought him to our vet. Vet said likely disc slipped or something called FCE. Leaning toward FCE as it doesn’t seem he is in much pain just lost most control of his back legs.  They aren’t entirely without sensation tho, the vet tested by pinching his toes to get a reaction. 

Said my options were neurologist and MRI or “nursing care at home”. Even if I could afford the MRI it might not tell us anything, and my vet would advise against spinal surgery on a 13 year old dog. (He had a major abdominal surgery 2 years ago).

So nursing care at home, but I have no idea what I’m going and the vets are not being very helpful in that regard. 

He can’t or won’t potty. He cannot get into position so he just sits there if brought outside. Holding him up isn’t helping, towel isn’t helping, trying a harness once it gets here from Amazon. 

But the first day he didnt go all day and peed his crate twice at night. Called the vet and they didn’t seem to concerned, asked if I should be expressing his bladder but I cannot get it to.

Yesterday again, no pee all day, expected him to wet his crate at night again, but he didn’t.

I rushed him to ER this morning bc at that point he’d gone 24 hours without peeing. ER vet gave him a catheter. Suggested I come in daily and keep having it done as “it’s hard to find male dog bladders”. Suggested laser and acupuncture. 

I’m willing to try but idk what I am going to do if I can’t get him to potty. I feel so lost and am not getting much help from vets.

He doesn’t seem in pain, just depressed.",2024-04-17 23:06:30

I rushed him to ER this morning bc at that point he’d gone 24 hours without peeing. ER vet gave him a catheter. Suggested I come in daily and keep having it done as “it’s hard to find male dog bladders”. Suggested laser and acupuncture. 

I’m willing to try but idk what I am going to do if I can’t get him to potty. I feel so lost and am not getting much help from vets.

He doesn’t seem in pain, just depressed.",2024-04-17 23:06:30
Suddenly paralyzed dog,"Just need support and advice, and not sure where to turn.

My 13 rat terrier struggled to get downstairs on Sunday night to go out, and wouldn’t get out of bed Monday morning. When I lifted him onto the floor it seems like his back legs were more or less paralyzed. 

Immediately brought him to our vet. Vet said likely disc slipped or something called FCE. Leaning toward FCE as it doesn’t seem he is in much pain just lost most control of his back legs.  They aren’t entirely without sensation tho, the vet tested by pinching his toes to get a reaction. 

Said my options were neurologist and MRI or “nursing care at home”. Even if I could afford the MRI it might not tell us anything, and my vet would advise against spinal surgery on a 13 year old dog. (He had a major abdominal surgery 2 years ago).

So nursing care at home, but I have no idea what I’m going and the vets are not being very helpful in that regard. 

He can’t or won’t potty. He cannot get into position so he just sits there if brought outside. Holding him up isn’t helping, towel isn’t helping, trying a harness once it gets here from Amazon. 

But the first day he didnt go all day and peed his crate twice at night. Called the vet and they didn’t seem to concerned, asked if I should be expressing his bladder but I cannot get it to.

Yesterday again, no pee all day, expected him to wet his crate at night again, but he didn’t.

Cat and relocation abroad problem ,"Dear all, 
I hope someone can offer me some good advice as I am at a loss on what to do.

 Have had my girl cat for 17 years. She was there with me through the hardest most difficult times, way before I met my husband and had kids. I rescued her from a drug house at only a month old, they wanted £20 for her I gave them £30 to take her and her brother out of there. I was a student then, took them both and got out of there as quick as I could. 

It is now 17 years later and we (my husband and i and 2 young kids) are relocating abroad from the Uk. We have 3 cats in total who should be coming with us, except my girl cat just failed her medical check up. They have found a small skin cancer on her mouth, a black melonoma. This itself she could travel with but it gets worse. 

After scans and an x ray they found a large cancer tumor in her stomach. She is on pain medication due to arthritis however the vet thinks it isn’t arthritis after all and she’s in pain from where the tumor is pressing down by her legs. She is for now, although walking slowly, still eating drinking and is generally speaking healthy looking and ‘fine’

He says she will most likely die on the flight (7 hour flight) I said I would pay for her to travel in cabin with me rather than the usual way, and would this make a difference-  her nerves would be lessened if she’s with me by my side. He said no that it’s not just that but the air pressure on the plane. He has got a second opinion from his colleague and they’ve both said they cannot sign her off. Vet is a very good central london vet. 

I am devastated and don’t know what to do. We have been planning this relocation for over a year and are all set to go in 3 months time as soon as my kids finish their last term of school. We have a house rented, schools everything . 

Most of my family are abroad. My mum lost her cat at 20 years old just last year and is still devastated and on anti depressants and said cannot take my cat as can’t emotionally go through another loss. Everyone else is busy travelling, have dogs, parents in law abroad more than they are home. I can’t hand her over to a cat shelter that would break her and my heart to just leave her to a cats shelter in her condition. 

For elderly people alone we have nursing homes. Is there any where like that for cats ? somewhere they can be properly looked after ? I’m sorry if that sounds silly, a quick google told me no such place exists ! 

The vets said she she could live until 20 or a few more months it depends how quick the tumor grows and her day to day health. There was no talk of putting her to sleep. 

I love her so much and I am just so torn right now.

Male Cats and Urethral Issues,"Hello!

I’m digging for some information to maybe help out a friend. It isn’t happy stuff, but I would appreciate any input!

My friend received a cat from a friend roughly a month and a half ago. Indeterminate breed, roughly 4 years old. The cat was previously a stray, evidently dumped by a family who didn’t want him, who eventually found his way to a coworker of my friend’s. This coworker left food out for him for a couple years and the cat hung around, staying in their garage, etc. 

Then, about a month and a half ago, this person gave the cat to my friend. She got him indoors, slowly switched the cat to a better quality dry food, introduced wet food, and got him set up to be an indoor cat. 

Well, this weekend, we had to rush the cat to the emergency vet. He had developed a urinary blockage. The vet attempted to correct this issue (catheter, flush, etc), but the urethra was torn and completely blocked. Due to the severity of the issue, and the significant expense in fixing it, the cat had to be euthanized.   

My friend is pretty well broken up over this. I know she, on some level, thinks it is her fault. I’m a little more doubtful of that. 

How long does this issue (crystallization of the urine to form a severe blockage) usually take to develop? From what I gather, stress, bad nutrition, lack of hydration, and, genetic disposition usually cause this issue in cats (predominantly males). 

What do you all think? Is there any reasonable action my friend could have taken to have prevented this from occurring? Or is it more likely the result of the cats previous lifestyle and treatment?",2024-04-17 13:54:57

Then, about a month and a half ago, this person gave the cat to my friend. She got him indoors, slowly switched the cat to a better quality dry food, introduced wet food, and got him set up to be an indoor cat. 

Well, this weekend, we had to rush the cat to the emergency vet. He had developed a urinary blockage. The vet attempted to correct this issue (catheter, flush, etc), but the urethra was torn and completely blocked. Due to the severity of the issue, and the significant expense in fixing it, the cat had to be euthanized.   

My friend is pretty well broken up over this. I know she, on some level, thinks it is her fault. I’m a little more doubtful of that. 

How long does this issue (crystallization of the urine to form a severe blockage) usually take to develop? From what I gather, stress, bad nutrition, lack of hydration, and, genetic disposition usually cause this issue in cats (predominantly males). 

What do you all think? Is there any reasonable action my friend could have taken to have prevented this from occurring? Or is it more likely the result of the cats previous lifestyle and treatment?",2024-04-17 13:54:57
Male Cats and Urethral Issues,"Hello!

I’m digging for some information to maybe help out a friend. It isn’t happy stuff, but I would appreciate any input!

Indian Ringneck Help,"My female Indian Ringneck named Ozzy has been with us for several years and she has picked up bad habits and been doing things we can’t stop her from doing.

Whenever she sees my mum she squawks constantly over and over again until someone gives her attention, and then once we leave she’ll do it again.

Whenever we let her out of her cage she’ll fly directly to the couch and start ripping the seems, if we try to stop her she’ll start biting. It’s not like we don’t buy her toys to chew it’s just when we do they’re gone in a few days and we can’t afford to constantly restock toys like that.

Despite the fact that my dad who is barely ever home for work reasons and harasses the bird when he is home (not constantly either so it’s not an attention thing, also I have begged him not to several times and he continues to) Ozzy loves him, never squawks, never bites, and when picked up will nestle with him and receive scratches for days. When I interact with her she’s nice and attempts to talk but is on high alert and will bite me if I do much a scratch her slightly to the left. When my mum interacts with her it’s the same but the squawking for attention whenever she isn’t. 

For some reason Ozzy seems to be scared shitless by bin bags, whenever anyone changes the bins over and takes them out she’s super loud and then when we walk over to the door to take the bags out (she’s near the door when she’s not outside) she goes really quiet. We don’t know where this came from cause she’s never had a bad experience with bins with us and it came up about a year or two  ago. Is anyone else’s bird like this or is there something we can do?

She has been like this for years and we thought we would have made some progress by now but none of the help websites seem to be working

My dog has a chipped tooth,My 1 year old Australian Shepherd has a chipped tooth but it doesn’t seem to bother him. I’m getting him checked out soon but I still worry about this. I haven’t seen any teeth fall out since I got him at 6 weeks old so is it still possible that he has baby teeth? It seems unlikely but I wouldn’t want for a chipped tooth to follow him pretty much the rest of his life lol. Thanks in advance,2024-04-17 11:21:03

4 Yr old Golden Retriever possible CCL Injury (slight tear),"  
Hi Everyone,  


My golden has been having issues putting weight on one of his back legs last few days. Took him to vet and they said (based on feel, no X-ray or anything) that he probably has a slight tear in his CCL. She recommended keeping him to walks only for 4-6 weeks and possibly cold laser therapy to see if it helps before suggesting surgery. She said it should help some scar tissue build up which could work in the long run  


Wanted thoughts of the community here and if you have any stories of your own would appreciate it. Is this ""rehab"" and relax a method that would work for a dog his size or is it going to end up with surgery no matter what most likely?  


Thanks in advance and I will reply best I can throughout!",2024-04-17 09:36:06

help!! pet layover in paris - rabies titer test,"Hey everyone, does anyone have experience with a layover in Paris CDG with their dog (Air France specifically)?

However, Air France requires that all pets need to be checked out and re-checked in, so I don’t know if he needs the test results.

Gfs Cat marks territory/flat since 10 days straight ,"The cat (m) of my gf marks/pisses in her flat for like 10 days or so straight. The cat is nearly 3 years old and according to my gf he never did that after the settling phase when he was a kitten... We tried everything. From positive reinforcement, telling him no, dragging him into his piss, ignoring, etc. 
Nothing worked. We excluded him from the bedroom as a last means so that he stops (we thought maybe he smells another cat from outside when we open the door to the garden) buuuttt after one day not marking he marks in front of us in the living room.


We don't know anymore, my gf is so stressed about it. We can't really sleep because everywhere it smells like ammonia. We did get Enzym cleaner but it really not helps that much because it went through the laminate when we did not notice when he did it again when we were away. 


About the living and general situation:
My gf works from home so she is generally home everyday nearly the whole day. 3 month ago she moved to her new flat with garden. She has another pet, a little dog (Chihuahua). I thought about that the dog is a stressor for the cat but really the cat weights about 8kg maybe more and is really big (not fat but just really big) and the Chihuahua is like 2kg at best so no real stressor when it is about aggressiveness.
Actually it the other way around, the cat often attacks the dog maybe just to play but the dog is just not strong enough for this kind of playing around...

We play with both of them often and cuddle them so it's not like we do not interact with him. The last marking was directly next to his toilet. The toilet will be cleaned every 1-3 days. 
He gets enough food, the toilet is behind a door and next to the kitchen due to just not having that much space. But this was never a problem in the last months.
It's not loud, no new people going in and out the house. No other animals in the flat. Just nothing changed but his marking behavior...

The only thing that is new in his behavior is that when he is on the couch and I pet him he purrs and makes biscuits and kind of dry humps the blanket. 



We just don't know what to do anymore. If someone has any ideas how to get his marking behavior to go away or why it is even there in the first place we would really appreciate it. Or if someone has tips how we can get the smell to go away entirely please let us know.
Thank for reading

Has anyone done this? I appreciate any insight. Research kind of just goes through how to post for a new owner etc.",2024-04-17 02:43:24

Best product you've found for chronic diarrhea problems,"So my dog has diarrhea on and off. I have done tests but there are no parasites. Vet said some dogs just tend to have stomach problems and told me to give him probiotics and sent a diarrhea med. I can't be paying over $100 each time he has diarrhea. Has anyone found a good product to maintain good flora? I read online that dogs can take a little bit of kefir, I'll try that since I make my own kefir. What about for those days he actually has diarrhea. Is there a good over the counter product that has worked for your dog to stop it?",2024-04-17 02:25:39

My dad's unhealthy habits trickled into his puppy's life. Now she's dead.,"My dad has a history of heart disease, high cholesterol, diabetes, and past history of drug use. 

My family has had 3 family pets. Each living from 11-13 years old.  My sister handed over her yorkie to help my parents cope after losing their favorite pet 5 years ago. She is still alive and doing okay at 10 years old.  My sister recently surrendered a mix terrier breed puppy to my parents, citing she didn’t have time to train the pup (sister saved the pup from euthanasia from an at capacity shelter in Houston).  That was 6 months ago.  On Sunday night the puppy died. The vet cited severe pancreatitis.  

While my mom has been away in Houston, I believe my dad has been eating unhealthy foods. Fast food and Mexican tacos, like carnitas meat, etc.  While he absolutely loves his dogs, I think his naivety led to the poor pups demise.  He probably thought he was giving them a tasty treat, gluttonous as it may have been.  My parents thought the pup was underfed to begin with because she had portion-sized kibble at my sister’s - I blame their boomer/immigrant mentality. 
  
I have immense guilt that I didn’t see signs of her being fed this trash diet.  I (32F) don’t live at home. My father has been wailing ever since she passed.  I want to tell him he caused her health to decline so that maybe he can see he’s hurting himself and others consequentially.  At the same time, who knows if the truth would be too hard for him to bare. 

I wish there were more PSA’s about the consequences of high fat diets or even discussions on pancreatitis.  I feel like, for instance, the campaign for bacon flavored everything could have led to misinformation on bacon being OK for your dog.  I’m just trying to put the pieces together on what went wrong and why this poor puppy couldn’t live to be mine one day instead. 

My PSA - talk to your parents about serious dog ownership. Don’t just assume that they’re sharp in the mind as they used to be when they raised you and you all had your family pets. ",2024-04-17 02:05:59

Is it possible that the vet did not properly neuter my dog? ,"Hi! My dog is a  1 year and 5 months AussieDoodle. He got neutered last year at Banfield Hospital. He had the cone, stitches, and everything but his behavior and other things are making me think it was not done properly. 

For one, he has smegma constantly. It drips on the floors, gets on the walls and couch. I thought it only happened to dogs that are not neutered?
For two, he has a major humping issue with other dogs. He likes to hump a lot and we even received complaints from daycare. He doesn’t hump toys or things just dogs. 
For three, other dogs react to him. I mean like when we are walking him, there will be other dogs on the same walk way, they all start barking at him even if he isn’t doing anything but walking. This happens all of the time. We thought it was because he is a very dominant dog but I’m starting to think his neuter wasn’t done properly or something. 

These are all just assumptions, I could be totally wrong but has anyone experienced this? Are these signs that he is not neutered? He does not have his testicals (balls) just the shriveled up skin. Is there a way to stop the smegma? 

We took him to the vet (the ones who did the neuter) and they just said wipe the smegma off. ",2024-04-17 01:59:23

Had to put dog down after Librela injection,"I am not sure where to post this.  But I wanted to get it out there in case anyone else is in the same or similar situation.  Let me also state that I am pro medicine, pro vaccine and I have faith in the medical systems.  

Last month on march 12th I brought my dog in for a routine check up -  Shiloh was a slightly older dog (between 8-12 years old, rescue didn’t know exactly how old).  He experienced walking issues with most of his life, limping due to an injury he received before I even got him back in 2017.  This injury caused him to get arthritis and hip dysplasia. 

Shiloh had been on regular pain meds for awhile, I went in because it seemed they had stopped working as well and he was starting to slow down even more.    Apparently he had a burr stuck in his paw for a few days so they removed it and gave him a topical to help with healing as well as a cone so he wouldn’t lick it off.

They recommended librela which is an arthritis injection which they said wouldn’t have any crazy side effects (cheaper than his standard pain meds).  I said we can give it a try to see how it works for him and we could even substitute for what he was on daily.  Two days go by and he seemed fine, burr was out walking pretty well until the evening of the 16th arrived.

He tried to walk up a smaller set of stairs like he normally would but he just stopped midway up in the in between portion.  (Stairs curve to a few more to get to the top).  He then just laid down and didn’t get back up.  I managed to get him outside and he had the ability to poop - that was it not even peeing.  I had that deep feeling in the pit of my stomach that this was serious and began to worry.  I brought his bed and blankets down from my room and kept him on the first level of the house to make sure he didn’t need to go far from the front door, and I brought some of my bedding down to sleep on the floor in my living room.  Fast forward a day of monitoring him and no improvements (he actually got worse, trouble breathing ect). I called the emergency vet on the night of the 17th because the clinic I took him to wasn’t available until the morning of the 18th.

On the way to the emergency vet my dog ended up having a stroke.  He his eyes were bloodshot red when I arrived and he was still fully paralyzed.  The emergency vet could not explain what had happened but after some minor research the doctor said it probably wasn’t the librela injection.   

The doctor recommended 3 scenarios which was 
1,)transfer a neurologist for additional testing (cost between 6-10K)
2.)give him more pain meds to “make him comfortable with no promise of recovery”
3.)euthanize him there.

With how I was feeling in the moment, calling friends and family for about an hour and the state of how my dog was I decided to go with 3 since he was in pain for most of his life and since I am struggling single dude with no financial fallback.  If I had the extra money I would have went route 1, if I wasn’t in shambles and knew he would recover I would have went 2 but there was no guarantee.  I just wanted my boy to not suffer anymore or be in pain.  

If anyone has any questions or needs additional information please don’t hesitate.  Upon some additional research, over the past couple of days the medical company’s stock is falling 8% due to reports of the injection making their animals fall ill  and vets “not knowing why”.  The last reports of this drug was November of 23 and out of nowhere people are reporting it’s harming their pets.  

I’m not sure if it’s just specific doses or what but it’s just frustrating for me since it appears that I’m not the only one affected by this.  

The clinic didn’t get me to sign anything before the injection either.  I’m not sure if I should take legal action or if I should just post my story  to see where others sit.  

Please do your research before getting medicines or trying new stuff on your pets.  I am paying the heavy cost of losing my best friend.",2024-04-17 01:31:54

Petlink,"So about 5 years ago I went to an adoption shelter with my ex and got 2 cats, he *insisted* at the time to get them registered in his name.

Due to the nature of the relationship I am no longer with him

I'm in the process of trying to get the cats information in my name. I have to do a transfer lf ownership for petlink.

However, I don't want my ex to find out or try to find me.

Should I continue with the transfer of ownership process for petlink, or would I be better off getting them new chips?

The main difference between the processes would be saving about $10 and potential complications of having the old chip removed.

Tips for rehoming abandoned dog?,"I found a dog tied up outside after the family moved. It was -10 outside, so we ended up taking the dog so she wouldn't die. We soon found out she was pregnant, so we let the Animal Humane Society know, as we hadn't wanted to keep her in the first place, much less a litter of puppies 

They TOLD us to keep her and help her have the puppies, then get in contact with them to surrender her. Great, now it's months later, most of the puppies are adopted, so she needs to go. 

NOW they are telling us they can't take her because ""she's technically a stolen dog,"" and a variety of other bs reasons directly contradicting what they told us. They will *not* take her now. 

We're stuck with this dog we shouldn't even have in the 1st place, that we just wanted to save from freezing to death while being abandoned. They're ""very sympathetic"" and ""happy we saved her"" but basically we should've left her to die. She needs medical attention we can't afford, and again, we aren't supposed to have her in the 1st place. Just fuck us for not watching her die outside. Even if we'd called somebody, she'd likely be dead or in critical condition before they got there.

What the heck am I supposed to do? I can't even do the right thing and surrender her to a no kill shelter, and I highly doubt people will want to take a dog with visible medical problems. She has either a massive cyst or rapidly growing cancer. Now it's my responsibility to pay money I very much cannot afford for vet trips and continuing care of a dog they promised me they would take? After spending an ass load of money to take care of 8 puppies? Very frustrated right now...",2024-04-16 23:54:11

What the heck am I supposed to do? I can't even do the right thing and surrender her to a no kill shelter, and I highly doubt people will want to take a dog with visible medical problems. She has either a massive cyst or rapidly growing cancer. Now it's my responsibility to pay money I very much cannot afford for vet trips and continuing care of a dog they promised me they would take?

Tips for rehoming abandoned dog?,"I found a dog tied up outside after the family moved. It was -10 outside, so we ended up taking the dog so she wouldn't die. We soon found out she was pregnant, so we let the Animal Humane Society know, as we hadn't wanted to keep her in the first place, much less a litter of puppies 

They TOLD us to keep her and help her have the puppies, then get in contact with them to surrender her. Great, now it's months later, most of the puppies are adopted, so she needs to go. 

NOW they are telling us they can't take her because ""she's technically a stolen dog,"" and a variety of other bs reasons directly contradicting what they told us. They will *not* take her now. 

We're stuck with this dog we shouldn't even have in the 1st place, that we just wanted to save from freezing to death while being abandoned. They're ""very sympathetic"" and ""happy we saved her"" but basically we should've left her to die. She needs medical attention we can't afford, and again, we aren't supposed to have her in the 1st place. Just fuck us for not watching her die outside. Even if we'd called somebody, she'd likely be dead or in critical condition before they got there.

Feels like my dog suddenly dislikes me,"Hi everyone, as mentioned in the title, I feel like my dog has suddenly become weary / afraid of me. It’s 

Here’s how it looks like nowadays:
I feed him breakfast and leaves for work
My mum takes care of him from morning till evening when I return from work
He greets me enthusiastically but the moment the enthusiasm wears off, his tail droops and he looks for places to hide.
I asked my mum whether he’s like that in the day, and she told me it only happens in the evening / night when I get home.

It is really heartbreaking for me because I love him and regard him as my best friend but it seems like he wants nothing to do with me. 😕

What can I do now? What do I do moving forward?

Thank you in advance. ",2024-04-16 22:30:30

Do you have a favorite?,"I was told that “I have a favorite” but I want to clarify that that’s not the case. I love both of my fuzzy babies, but I love them very differently.

Hi so we recently got a tray kitten that is sick it has a runny nose and discharge in its eye. ,We already isolated the kitten from our dogs the problem is they kept finding ways to get close to the kitten and keeps licking it. How could I prevent them getting any diseases from the stray kitten? Cause I feel the kitten has some disease. Is pyrantel embonante enough as a prevention?,2024-04-16 19:57:05

Need help reaching my dog to lay down.,"I have a puppy who i have been training the past few days, but he isn’t getting how to lay down. He can sit just fine and he’s smart in every other bit if training, but he isn’t doing as well in this area. With my past puppies, i would use some kibble to make them sit, then pull my hand down and drag it towards me and they learned pretty quickly what it meant. This puppy once i put my hand to the ground, stands up and just tries to go after it while still standing. I’m sure he would eventually get it if i kept working at it, but it’s hard to keep his attention when he’s struggling so much to get the treat because he isn’t laying down; i also don’t want to confuse him or  anything. Any tips or advice in general? ",2024-04-16 19:24:55

Travel advice for anxious elderly kitty,"My cat is 13 years old, she hasn’t been in a car in 13 years, my parents believed cats did not need veterinary care like dogs so as I’ve grown into an adult I want to better take care of her. 

I’m moving because she lives in terror from two dogs (one is fine but my sisters dog that she brought over from her work travels and has now made my cats life miserable.) 

I am ashamed of the life she has had this last year. She is now too anxious to leave my bedroom which has her litter tray, cat tree and bed. She is so anxious when I move her into another room in the house I have no idea how to bring her into a car and drive an hour to my new apartment. I seriously do not know. There are no vets that can come to me where I live because I live in a rural area. 

She is not a pill taker I HAVE TRIED. I try so hard to take care of her but she does not like being handled. She’s always been this way since we rescued her. 

PLEASE HELP ME. Smelly things or treats can I buy that she will eat to help calm her for this trip because I do honestly think she could die from shock. I’m literally not kidding. I want this to be as calming as I can but I can’t take her to the vet, the car is the problem, she is way too anxious and old.

Claw caps for Foster with skin conditiong,"I’m new here just looking for advice😭

I just took in a foster, the previous owners severally neglected him. He has a long list of food allergies and I am already in the process of switching food, the big issue, his skin has developed SEVERE hot spots. A good portion of his back n butt are almost completely scabbed over n fur-less from scratching and chewing. 

I got the chewing under control with a cone and soft muzzle but I’m having trouble stopping the scatching, Ive seen a few people mention claw caps and wondered if this could be an additional aid while we get his sores under wraps? 

Any help n advice is appreciated😭",2024-04-16 15:23:01

Help and Advise!! My Ginger Tom keeps urinating all over our furniture inside the house.,"Hi all. I'm hoping someone can help me find the solution. I'm all out of ideas now and there are not very much options left. 

Let me start from the beginning. I have a 6 year old Ginger Tom. I've had him since he was a kitten and it started out as being just me and him. He's always used a litter tray and was neutered right away from a young age. I then had a room mate around a year later who had a dog and the peeing started around the house. And naturally I thought it was to mark his territory with having another animal in the house. This became never ending and eventually I moved out and took the cat with me. 

Now he still would use his cat litter but not all the time. So I took to the vets and they suspected cictitis and so we medicated and the peeing issue stopped! Hoorray!

However, I then moved into my partners house 2 years later and the cat had easy access outside and so would always do his business outside, but I'd kept the litter available as a just incase. And again no issues. Fast forward 9+ months and our beautiful son arrived and the peeing has begun again. And mainly in our son's room. So I'm thinking it's a territory thing again right? We no longer let the cat upstairs, no matter how hard he tries to get up there. But now our living room is the new hot spot. And it's always in different areas around the room. I've tried everything. I've medicated for cictitus again, I've cleaned the room with citrus, I've use the plug in femway aromas. And it's still happening. Just little deposits of wee. And more recently he'll just do it infront of us. my son is now 10 months old and starting to explore the house more and so this just can't continue going forward and it would break my heart to get rid of him but I'm just at a loss of what to do. Has anybody had to deal with something similar and found a solution? Thanks!",2024-04-16 13:19:44

Is there any ways to bring a cat to Dubai,"I have heard usually there are two ways:

  
1. **Etihad 1500 dollars** to Abudhabi, and then from AbuDhabi to Dubai.

2. **Emirates cargo** way to bring cat to Dubai,  I am confused the website mentioned the price is 500dollars for small cat however, however, I consulted few agents recommended by official Emirates airline, they quoted over 2000 dollars ....even higher than Etihad...

Except for above two. I had an idea. Can I take flight with my cat to a nearby country to UAE , and then choose bus or drive to Dubai? would it be more cheaper????",2024-04-16 12:10:51
Euthanasia - when to know it’s time and other questions,"Hi all,

For those who have put their pup down, how did you know it was time? My dog is a 14 yr old husky (for reference, life expectancy is usually 12-14) who has been slowly deteriorating for quite some time. His back legs have been weakening and more recently they have been occasionally giving out. He has atopic dermatitis and in the past weeks it has flared up to an extent we haven’t seen before and while his meds are helping, it doesn’t seem to be resolving/resolving at the same rate as usual. This results in itching and sometimes he pulls out his hair. His weight and appetite have been declining but he still usually waits for his food/has interest in eating (and sometimes he even does a little half-bounce which is left over from what used to be his dinner-dance). He enjoys pets but has never been super cuddly/attention seeking (think stereotypical independent husky) so it’s hard to gauge his mental state in that regard, but he does seem to be experiencing some early stages of doggy-dementia. I suppose my question is, how do you know when it’s time? I don’t think he’s ready to go just yet, but I don’t know what constitutes as grounds for euthanasia. 

Another thing, the poor boy really hates the vet and at this point isn’t strong enough to get in the car/make the trip (he is also scared of cars). We are going to do an at-home euthanasia (not through his current vet) and I was wondering if I needed to notify his vet? I haven’t really liked them or their approach to treating my pup so I’m inclined to just ghost them at this point.

On a little bit of a nicer note, I’m trying to come up with a “bucket list” of things I want to do/get him before he crosses the rainbow bridge, and I would love suggestions. Thus far i have gotten those ink-less ink pads to get his paw print, and I plan on getting him a big ol’ burger and some ice cream when the time comes (he has always had a sweet tooth). 

Thank you all in advance!",2024-04-16 11:47:35

My Neighbors stole my outdoor cat.,"A few months ago I came across a stray cat that was nearly tame, this wasn't out of the ordinary considering I have food out for stray cats. I named him Eddie started slowly taming him. It took a while as I didn't see him to often, but about a month ago I was able to pet and hold him.

He became more used to people and I started to let him in the house. I was not planning to adopt him as my mom doesn't want more pets as we already have 6, but my dad was willing to take him since he lives seperate from me.

He visited nearly everyday until about a week ago. I am aware that tomcats do wonder, but the last day I had seen him he spent the whole day with me, so that seemed unlikely.

Regardless, I move on and hope he comes back, but today my brother was talking to one of our neighbor's kids. The kid said that his parents had dropped the cat somewhere outside of town. Not at a farm, but just some random place. The reason being is because Eddie had been peeing in their yard and it upset the kid's father. 

Me, as well as my whole family, are very angry about the situation. My mom is either going to or has already made a post about him in a lost pet group for our town/county in hopes of getting him back or at least making sure he is in a safe place. Any other advice on what we could do would be very much appreciated.

Edit: I am going to sleep now so I will not be responding to anyone for a while. I am contemplating removing the post when I wake up because I have received a lot of negative comments. 

For clarification, I am aware that it is not okay to allow a pet to use the bathroom in someone else's yard, or any place that is not your yard, really. I am angery at how the neighbor handled the situation, not that he is up upset about the cat's actions.

This post was also not made to debate rather stray cats should be fed or not. I will no longer be responding to people about this topic.

I would also like to thank anybody that gave me suggestions or defended me from the negative comments.

Have a wonderful day/night!",2024-04-16 06:49:12

Do cats suffer when they get euthanized?,"Hi everyone, I wanted to write what happened today because what I saw today is still on my mind and I can't get it out of my head. I thought maybe someone can tell me if what I saw was normal or am I overthinking. 

So my cat was 2 years old and he loved to go outside but a few days ago he was gone for 2 days and I was worried because he normally never goes out for that long. After 2 days he came this Saturday the 13th April back home in the evening when I came back from work. Normally when I call him he would respond immediately but this time he seemed to be so tired and hungry so I thought that that's normal since he was gone for 2 days and hadn't eaten anything. He was also covered in fly eggs which I noticed the next morning so I combed everything out checked everywhere for any injuries and washed him so that no eggs would remain. He was very calm before and after I washed him and also refused to eat anything. He was not breathing abnormally or anything just very tired. After that he fell asleep and was sleeping almost the whole day. And I started to notice later that day (sunday) that his breathing changed lightly. He was breathing faster than normal but not like heavy breathing that you could notice. I decided to wait and see if anything changed and maybe becomes better but I was going to bring him monday which was today for a checkup. I woke up early to see if he was better but he was still breathing like that. When I called the vet she said I could come in the evening but I was really worried that he wouldn't make it. I tried to feed him, give him water and keep him warm and comfortable before his appointment. Arround 11 o'clock he started to breath heavily and it looked like he couldn't breath and started to cry out loud. I was panicking so I told my sister to call our vet and ask her to bring him immediately because he was not doing well. She didn't pick up so I asked her to call any vet so that we could bring him. A vet not far from us told us to bring him and when he checked him, he said that he was choking because there was fluid in his lungs something like that. He showed the x-ray and he said that he could see a black line close to his heart which is not normal and is air that shouldn't be in that place.

I was crying so much also because he kept saying that I came too late and i felt really guilty for not doing anything sooner. I still blame myself and i understand why he would say that but it's not that I did it intentionally. I had no experience and truly didn't know that it could be fatal. He put him on oxygen and said that he tried to get the fluid out but it didn't help much and he also was coughing the fluid out with puss plus his body temperature dropped to 34 degrees Celsius. He told me that he was struggling really hard and was in pain and the only option was to euthanize him. I was crying so much that I couldn't even reply back and my sister told me that it's better to let him go than suffer like this. I saw him lay there breathing with oxygen and his eyes half closed. He kept moving his little head looking at us. I couldn't even say goodbye properly because he was doing everything so fast when we agreed to it. 

He said that he would give him something to fall asleep before euthanizing him but that didn't seem to work.when he gave him the injection he didn't fell asleep but struggled really hard to breath. After that he didn't wait and euthanized him but it was the worst thing I had ever seen in my life. He was crying and screaming and did everything in his power to resist. And the screams I heard were so bad that he asked me to leave the room and wait outside. I thought they wouldn't struggle and die peacefully but this was a nightmare. His screams are in my head and can't stop crying thinking about how much he must have suffered. I asked him about the injection and if he really didn't feel any pain but he had no time to explain because he had to go somewhere else so said to contact him later for questions. 

If I wrote something wrong sorry for that, English is not my best.

Hope that someone can explain me more about this.

Thank you all for the kind words 🤍, I have read every one of them and still reading all of them and I'm sorry if I didn't reply to all of them. It's been day 2 and I feel sick and my head hurts from all rhe crying, I can't find the words to describe the pain I feel but time will heal and I can't bring him back anymore so I just really hope that no one has to ever go through something like this...it's really hard and I miss him so much.

He showed the x-ray and he said that he could see a black line close to his heart which is not normal and is air that shouldn't be in that place.

I was crying so much also because he kept saying that I came too late and i felt really guilty for not doing anything sooner. I still blame myself and i understand why he would say that but it's not that I did it intentionally. I had no experience and truly didn't know that it could be fatal. He put him on oxygen and said that he tried to get the fluid out but it didn't help much and he also was coughing the fluid out with puss plus his body temperature dropped to 34 degrees Celsius. He told me that he was struggling really hard and was in pain and the only option was to euthanize him. I was crying so much that I couldn't even reply back and my sister told me that it's better to let him go than suffer like this. I saw him lay there breathing with oxygen and his eyes half closed. He kept moving his little head looking at us. I couldn't even say goodbye properly because he was doing everything so fast when we agreed to it. 

He said that he would give him something to fall asleep before euthanizing him but that didn't seem to work.when he gave him the injection he didn't fell asleep but struggled really hard to breath. After that he didn't wait and euthanized him but it was the worst thing I had ever seen in my life. He was crying and screaming and did everything in his power to resist. And the screams I heard were so bad that he asked me to leave the room and wait outside. I thought they wouldn't struggle and die peacefully but this was a nightmare. His screams are in my head and can't stop crying thinking about how much he must have suffered. I asked him about the injection and if he really didn't feel any pain but he had no time to explain because he had to go somewhere else so said to contact him later for questions. 

If I wrote something wrong sorry for that, English is not my best.

Hope that someone can explain me more about this.

Thank you all for the kind words 🤍, I have read every one of them and still reading all of them and I'm sorry if I didn't reply to all of them. It's been day 2 and I feel sick and my head hurts from all rhe crying, I can't find the words to describe the pain I feel but time will heal and I can't bring him back anymore so I just really hope that no one has to ever go through something like this...it's really hard and I miss him so much.

Do cats suffer when they get euthanized?,"Hi everyone, I wanted to write what happened today because what I saw today is still on my mind and I can't get it out of my head. I thought maybe someone can tell me if what I saw was normal or am I overthinking. 

So my cat was 2 years old and he loved to go outside but a few days ago he was gone for 2 days and I was worried because he normally never goes out for that long. After 2 days he came this Saturday the 13th April back home in the evening when I came back from work. Normally when I call him he would respond immediately but this time he seemed to be so tired and hungry so I thought that that's normal since he was gone for 2 days and hadn't eaten anything. He was also covered in fly eggs which I noticed the next morning so I combed everything out checked everywhere for any injuries and washed him so that no eggs would remain. He was very calm before and after I washed him and also refused to eat anything. He was not breathing abnormally or anything just very tired. After that he fell asleep and was sleeping almost the whole day. And I started to notice later that day (sunday) that his breathing changed lightly. He was breathing faster than normal but not like heavy breathing that you could notice. I decided to wait and see if anything changed and maybe becomes better but I was going to bring him monday which was today for a checkup. I woke up early to see if he was better but he was still breathing like that. When I called the vet she said I could come in the evening but I was really worried that he wouldn't make it. I tried to feed him, give him water and keep him warm and comfortable before his appointment. Arround 11 o'clock he started to breath heavily and it looked like he couldn't breath and started to cry out loud. I was panicking so I told my sister to call our vet and ask her to bring him immediately because he was not doing well. She didn't pick up so I asked her to call any vet so that we could bring him. A vet not far from us told us to bring him and when he checked him, he said that he was choking because there was fluid in his lungs something like that.

Does anyone have know a good dog house?,"I have a 5 month old puppy (first dog). She can be trusted in the house with supervision, but not yet be trusted without supervision. I have a feeling I’ll still be working on unsupervised house access when it gets hotter, I’m talking 100 F (38 C for people that live where things make sense) plus humidity will make it hotter.
I go to work, what kind of dog house should I get her? 
Because she can’t hold her pee long enough to be crated. ",2024-04-16 04:43:28

Is it okay to bring cat back to the shelter?,"A couple of days ago I adopted a cat. This is my first time ever getting a pet, so I did my research. I adopted the cat, was very happy taking her home and she’s very sweet. Now it turns out, I’m allergic. It really feels like I can’t breathe. A lot of people have been giving me all these tips, allergy medication (which I’m already taking), eye drops, nasal sprays, amp up my astma medication, vaccuum every day etc. The thought of doing all these things gives me mayor stress and anxiety. It just all feels like way too much. I feel very stressed on top of the physical issues because of the allergy. 
To add to that, the cat is extremely needy. She constantly wants to cuddle, be pet, is constantly meowing and follows me everywhere. I’m scared it’s because she feels my anxiety and stress and it’s giving her anxiety. She also kneads very obsessively when I pet her, which makes me think she feels anxious too. 
I feel like the situation isn’t ideal for either of us and I feel like she deserves a better home. It feels like giving her up now would be less bad for her than giving her up later when she might be more attached to me.
I feel terrible about it, but I was completely unaware of my allergies. Am I a terrible person for wanting to give her back to the shelter? I just want her to have the best possible home and I just don’t feel like I can give her that.",2024-04-16 04:24:38

"Help. We don't want to get rid of our sweet boy, but he is causing us so many issues with his behavior.","Tried to post this on a breed-specific sub but have insufficient karma so here I end up, still looking for help.

We have a 3.5 year old male who is causing us quite a bit of grief. He's sweet but has absolutely no impulse control. We've owned him and been working with him since we got him as a puppy, but nothing has improved. Honestly, things get worse every year. Now we have a toddler and another baby and are getting close to giving him up. Here are some examples of our issues:  
  
No control of or care for his body. He has flung our toddler into the walls with his butt more than once. We have taught our toddler to be careful around him, but our dog just comes barreling through with no regard for anything around him. If he gets even remotely excited, he spins in 3-foot circles, destroying everything in the vicinity. This made sense when he was a puppy, but he is almost 4 now.  
  
Barks at everything (and nothing). Any noise will get him going. If someone comes to the door, he'll bark for an hour or more (not exaggerating). At Christmas, we had to put him in the garage for 2+ hours to get him to stop. And even then, he came back in and barked more.  
  
While he listens O.K. to me, he does not listen to anyone else. He ignores commands from anyone but me, despite my wife actually being his primary trainer as a puppy. This isn't too big of a deal since I'm usually around, but it is annoying.  
  
He is incredibly pushy. He pushes our older dog out of the way all of the time for attention, despite getting more than ample attention. If we try to pet our other dog, he just knocks him out of the way. If we go for a walk, he bum-rushes the door to ensure he's the first one out. We've tried every common dog training technique to correct this, but our other dog is a hardcore beta and our Berner can't seem to figure out manners. For reference, our older dog is a golden retriever. Obviously, a much calmer and easier to manage breed. But we got him as a puppy and trained him on our own. He has nearly perfect manners, so it's not like we just don't know how to train a dog. We just don't know how to train this dog.  
  
We love our Berner and genuinely believe he's a sweet dog at heart. We want him to be part of our family and thought maybe he would mature out of some of these issues, but as you may know, 4 is pretty close to middle age for these guys, and he hasn't matured at all. If anything, he has noticeably regressed (probably because we had kids, but I will always put my human children above dogs, not sorry about that in the least). It actually seems like he dislikes the kids and really doesn't want to be part of the family unless we are feeding him or taking him to do something.  
  
We take him on a 1.5 hour walk every day, and he's around to interact with the family throughout the day (we work from home). It's not like he's being ignored or not getting any exercise. We just don't know what to do. If things don't get better soon, we're going to have to give him up for our kids' safety.  
  
This breaks our hearts and any suggestions on how to improve things would be greatly appreciated. Going back to the breeder is not an option for us. All we need is to be able to teach him some impulse control so we can trust him around the kids. If we could fix that, we could live with the rest of his issues. Any recommendations for dog trainers who are experienced in this issue in the Spokane area would also be helpful, also just ideas we could try ourselves.",2024-04-16 04:08:00

Am I taking a good care of my pet and how can I be a better owner,"I don't know why I never thought of coming to Reddit for this but I would like some help with my pet parrot he is a cockatiel and he is about 5-6 years old I've had him since he was a few months old and I've tamed him within a few weeks of having him and he has been a really good bird for the most part but i would like some feedback 

When I first had him I've tried letting him outside his cage from once to twice a week it really varies I was in my second or first year of high school and sometimes I would let him out daily other times less frequently I'm currently 21 and unemployed so i try to let him outside more often but sometimes i fail to due to some complications 

As for diet it's mainly seed and lettuce based I've tried teaching him to eat other foods such as certain fruit and veggies but he just doesn't like them and instead sticks with lettuce and seeds 

He is very cuddly and knows a few tricks but I really struggle to make a lot of time for him but I really want to give him a happy and healthy life also get easily scared by most objects and really isn't interested in toys 

I feel like I haven't done good as an owner and that why I would like some feedback and learn how to improve 

Small vent too I never really wanted him I can recall saying it would be nice to own one and a few months later my parents just get one without telling me and dumb him onto me and say that's your responsibility and additionally they are horrible sometimes they'll get annoyed by his singing and will throw objects at his cage to make him stop which makes me feel so bad for it

I feel like I could have been a much worse owner like my parents who all they know is to throw things at him or worse and just because I take some care of him that doesn't make me any better of an owner 

I plan and hope to move out of the country by the end of the year or sometime next year and I won't be able to take him with me but I still want to give him the proper care that he deserves and make sure he lives a happy and a healthy life 

So any tips and feedback would be greatly appreciated!

I feel like Embrace Pet Insurance is basically a scam?,"I originally signed up for Embrace through USAA since I have had great experience with them. But, over the past couple years premiums slowly crept up until this year when the renewal went from $165/month to $230/month. I had never had a claim and my dog while a large breed is only five years old. At this rate I can only imagine what the premiums will be in a couple years.

I wish I would have just put the money into a savings account, I would have at least $6,500 waiting for a major expense. Which is enough to cover really any surgery and most cancer treatments. With deductibles and policy maximums I just don't see how I am actually saving any money in the event of an emergency.

Then, when I looked on their website to quote a policy that might have different deductibles/maximums and be cheaper I found that they are underwriting new policies with way better terms at less than half the price of my renewal rate. So just be warned that their pricing is based on basically nothing but, how much they can charge you before you jump ship and they'll get you in the door with a reasonable rate then jack it up after a few years regardless of whether or not you have claims.",2024-04-16 02:38:13

Cat is afraid of outdoors?,"Does anyone have similar experiences? Me and my fiance have a two year old cat. He is very curious, and loves to watch squirrels, birds, dogs and everything like that from the window. Everytime we forget to close the hallway door, he RUNS outside and tries to escape, but thank god he never got too far or lost. 
Anyhow, as he LOVES to go outside we decided to try to go outside on leash.  (he has been outside on leash before too, in our last home last summer) but it’s been a while since we live in Finland and have very cold and snowy winters. The problem might be surprising, because he is deadly afraid to go out. We live in a row house with two floors so we have stairs outside which we have to go down and he just can’t make it pass them. At first we tried to carry him down, but it didn’t seem like a good idea to him so we obviously let him back inside. Does anyone have any tips how to make him less afraid? In the last home he clearly enjoyed going outside and this is a new thing.",2024-04-16 00:50:49

I have no idea what I'm doing,"So recently my cat Jellybean has taken to catching mice and bring them into the house alive to play with them. Every time we've caught the mouse and taken it back outside or one of her siblings has grabbed it before we could and ran off with it. Well a few days ago she did it again this time just dropping it off in the kitchen and watching it run for it's life. Since then we've been trying to chase it down and finally last night when I went to reset the live trap I looked inside and saw two little eyes staring back at me.

We all agreed that if she keeps this up we're going to end up with a pet mouse and well I guess we do now. The problem is I have no clue how to actually take care of one. My grandma's cat Mao did the same thing a few years ago and she still has the tank and water feeder she got for Bob so we have that covered but it's been over 30 years since my mom had Turret-Head and I'm lost about everything else.


Little Pip needs bedding right but what can I use? Can I use shredded paper, dryer lint, pillow stuffing, egg cartons or my cousin's duck bedding? Or is there something specific that would make them more happy like lawn clippings? Do certain species like different bedding? How often should I change Pip's bedding?

We're pretty sure the mice Jellybean has been catching are living in our compost bin so should I try and catch the others? The bin is built out of pallets and is pretty big so what are the chances there's more than one mouse family in there? If there is and I catch them will they hurt Pip? What if they get on too well and have pinkies? I doubt PetCo or PetsMart will take wild babies and the local shelters focuse mainly on cats, dogs and horses.

How do I get Pip to trust me enough to check if Jellybean hurt them? Should I take Pip to the vet? Most vets in the area focus on farm animals, birbs, dager noodles, cats, dogs and larger rodents like hamsters, rabbits, and guinea pigs. Would a vet even book an appointment for a mouse?

I gave Pip some celery last night can I keep giving them that until I get food from the store? Should I get food from the store? We're a 3, technically 4, generational house so we have a lot of food scraps, should I give those to Pip? I'd imagine even if mice aren't picky eaters that tomatoes, bread crust and the like would be more appealing than food pellets or whatever. Are there any foods mice shouldn't have? If I shouldn't give Pip scraps and the store doesn't have mice specific food is there another kind of pet food I should get?

How do I tell if Pip is a boy mouse or a girl mouse? Is Pipsqueak a cliche name for a mouse? How do I tell how old Pip is? Is there any easy way to tell when kind of mouse Pip is? We still have a small rock pond from when my dad had pet frogs ~15 years ago, should I give it to Pip? Would Pip even like something like that? If I sew Pip a little cushion bed and hammock will they eat them? How long should I wait until I take Pip places? I don't trust Mocha or my little brother around Pip and I'm going out of town later this month.

Am I worrying too much? I'm worrying too much aren't I?",2024-04-16 00:20:21

Cat aggressively attacks feet ,"The hot weather is getting closer so I need less bedding. Since I got only sheets in my bed, my resident cat would aggressively attack my feet . At first I thought it was because I was moving my feet while sleeping but then I tested fake sleep and she would just  jump and scratch and bite my feet with no reason at all and in a way she would hurt a lot. Even if my feet are to one side and there is no bump in the sheets she would just attack and not in a playful way. The same thing doesn't happen to my husband. I have some wounds and scratch marks on booth feet now.
I rescued her from the streets but been realizing that she's a bit agressive with me and not with my husband, and it seems worse since we adopted our new cat ( that still couldn't introduce). She's  getting worse over time, only thinking about food, not allow to be petted and constantly scratching our hands and face when picked up.
Now with this situation it's been impossible to sleep because she sleeps with us.
Is there anything I should do?",2024-04-15 23:41:44

2-month old Kitten Behavior ,"He came home with us yesterday and screamed for nearly the entire day. We had placed him inside his carrier bag in the living room, letting him come out when he felt comfortable. He was extremely active and playful after he came out from his bag(running around and exploring the entire house) and seemed to adapt quickly(using the litter box on the first day and even sleeping with us in bed).

However, we discovered that he is still super scared of us, even though he often approaches us. Every time we tried to put our fingers close to his nose, he flys away😭. He follows us to different areas of the house and plays around us but never allows us to approach him😭. Additionally, every time we move or make a sound, he runs away💨

Has anyone with cat knowledge any advise for this situation? We are devastated… :(,"Hello and a good afternoon cat friends!

I am writing this message out of pure devastation to be honest, I am not sure what and why this is happening and I thought maybe anyone here has an idea or any advice on this…

Backstory:
I have a nine year old male cat named Krümel that I love a lot. My male best friend Lukas watched him every now and then since I got him about two years ago. When I was not at home, he watched him, he was at my place all the time and the two had a very close bond, cuddled all the time etc. 
I met my boyfriend Carl over these two years and we moved together January this year.  We also tried to find a companion for Krümel, but the other cat started bullying him sadly even though we tried to let them meet slow as possible, so we couldn’t keep the other cat.

Now to the problem: 
Since Carl and I moved into the new flat in January, Krümel attacks Lukas when he comes to our home. He NEVER did that and it always comes completely out of the blue. He just really aggressively attacks Lukas and bites him very hard, scratches him and seems very upset suddenly. We just don’t know how to handle this anymore. Krümel doesn’t attack anyone else that comes to our place. Of course Lukas is very scared now and doesn’t like being at our place anymore. 
I just can’t figure out what this is about and how to bring the two together again, they loved each other so much. Also Lukas was there before I met my bf, and Krümel never once attacked Carl like that. Everything was finde always. Also Lukas and Carl are really good friends. I just don’t understand and of course Lukas ist super sad about this as well, because Krümel and him always had such a strong bond…
Maybe anyone knows what could lead to behavior like that and how one should handle these attacks, or the contact in general?

Sorry for the long paragraph and I wish you all  and great and sunny day!

Shiba Inu Peeing in the house and biting more hard,"Hello everyone,

My 2 year old shiba inu has recently (within the last 4 days) peed in the house 5 times and started becoming more aggressive. He's also biting harder than he used to (drawing blood). He is properly potty trained and has NEVER done this before even when we travel. He has been getting over an hour of walking outside, ample food, play, love, and rest. We keep him at my friend's house bc my roommate is scared of dogs but I go over every day spending a lot of time there. However, I have gone out of town for those 4 days. I'm really worried for him and was wondering what I can do to help him return back to normal.

Thank You Very Much!",2024-04-15 12:14:07

Is it okay to let my indoor cat be outside? Risks? Lifespan.,"I found a cat outside July or June of 2023, so she’s almost a year old. To give a little context my neighborhood has SO many cats, like from sitting infront of my porch I can count 12 my neighbor and me feed them and my neighborhood is green and I garden so the outdoor kitties love it here.
Anyways the main point is, is it okay I let my cat outside during the day and then she comes inside during the night? I noticed she stays near my house or chills in my big garden, I know this bc I have a clicker and a designated call and whenever I call she comes. Typically she’s only outside when I garden or landscape but it’s for up to 7 hours she’s outside. It’s not everyday since I leave for work 2 out of 7 days a week and those days she sits in and more recently I’ve limited her days to 3 days a week she’s outside but it can range from 1-7 house out. None of my outside cats( to my knowledge) have rabies. My is spayed but doesn’t have any vaccinations because my nearest vet is 40 minutes away and I’m always busy. If anyone has any tips on that pls help because I saw something about home vaccinations but I am scared to do that.
Also to mention, I feed my cat a wet food diet, sometimes kibble with water because I’m busy.",2024-04-15 11:27:28

I walk my dog as often as I can, 4-5 times a day when I’m home, and I’ve never seen their dogs outside.

I rehomed my cat last year and I miss him so much.,"I adopted a flame point siamese in January 2023, I always wanted a cat and I finally did it and he was the most beautiful boy. He had the brightest blue eyes and an orange raccoon tail with an orange face. His owner didn’t want him anymore, not sure why, so I got him for free and he was so sweet. 

I didn’t realize siamese’s were so chill, but he so was calm and never bit or scratched anyone. He loved everyone and was curious about everything. He was also very vocal which was definitely sometimes a bit much lol. But I loved him anyway. He was so amazing and truly my best friend.. I hope that doesn’t sound weird but he was my first ever pet as well. 

I struggle with a lot of mental health issues and he definitely helped me a lot, just by simply being there. I would take him out for walks and honestly they helped me too. But by the summer I was getting worse. By September, I had an overdose and had to be admitted to the hospital. And when that happened, all I could think about was how I abandoned him and what a terrible owner I am.

I could barely care for myself, let alone care for my boy Leo. I was feeding him of course and keeping his litter clean but I couldn’t play with him anymore. I kept him out of my room all the time while I laid in my bed by myself. And he would meow so much, I felt so bad. I tried getting pheromone sprays to help with his stress, I would play with him but for a shorter amount of time. Or even buy him self entertaining toys but he never liked them. He only wanted my company and I couldn’t even give him that. Also at the time, my relationship with my boyfriend was falling apart and I lived in his dad’s other apartment so I feared they would kick me out soon. 

My guilt was eating me alive for how bad I’ve been to him, he didn’t deserve any of that. But I loved him so much, so it was hard to come to that decision but it felt necessary. I vetted out the owners I gave him to, they were the nicest family with no problems and they’re still taking great care of him now. My boyfriend still hates me for giving my cat away. He bonded with him too and felt like what I did was selfish. Like I just abandoned my cat, which hurts, but I did what I thought was best. I am doing better now but I regret not being well enough to keep my boy. But I’ll never regret the time I got to spend with him. He’ll always have a place in my heart, I wish I could upload a picture so you guys could see him, he was so beautiful.

It's tick season...,"Hello all!

It's tick season, and I've never had a tick on my dog until now. She's two years old, and she's a Pitbull/Blue Heeler mix. For anyone who isn't familiar with a Heeler's coat, they appear short on top, but the have a ***very*** thick undercoat. I feel the tick there and can see it pushing the fur up more and more over the past couple days (so I haven't actually seen it to 110% confirm lol. But with the growing size and sudden appearance, I'm pretty confident that it is a tick). This is my first Heeler I've had and of course the first tick I've had on her, so I'm really struggling on getting to it to entirely validate it and how to even remove it. Actually.. this is the first dog I've *ever* had with a tick. I lived in AZ most of my life, so they were never a concern before. Any and all help/tips would be greatly appreciated.",2024-04-15 08:45:39

Embrace Pet Insurance,"Question about Embrace. 

I get them with USAA for ~60/mo for my pup. 

600 deductible, $250 wellness, 80%

When I first got my pup, she got a small eye infection which was treated in a few days with an ointment. They have that listed as a pre-existing condition now? If she has issues with her eyes later in life, are they going to try and say that infection she had at 4mo old is the cause? 

I've seen a lot of terrible reviews on here, and a few good ones but I've been considering cancelling her pet insurance and just putting the money aside each month instead. 

Thank you!",2024-04-15 08:21:09

"Stow-away fish, need urgent help on how to help it","Hello reddit, I really need some help with this stow-away Albino Corydora, but first I think some context is necesary.

I am a huge plant enthusiast and after having made multiple terrestrial terrariums for plants I had been considering to make an underwater terrarium. I had been looking into it for a while now and have been doing my research on the subject, I had no intentions of having any sort of animals but I have been looking into the posibility of having a fish tank for fun.

Today I finaly bought the acuatic plants I wanted and had all the materials I needed to make the terrarium happen. After finnaly finishing it I decided to fill it with water and when doing so I noticed that something odd was in one of the bags I has my plants in... Tourns out it was this little fellow who has somehow ended up with me.

I sort of panicked and put it into a small glass container in wich I alredy had a marimo moss ball in. So now my family and I are debating what exactly to do with the poor fellow. We have been looking into the possibility of a pet for ages now but fish were never really a contender until now.

So we are considering keeping it and of course explaining to the store what happened and paying for the fish, getting it friends as this species does betterwith some company. Or giving it back to the store.

My main worry at the moment is what to do until the shops open, I have no experience with fishkeeping and at the moment I just want to make sure the fish is as conftarble as possible before the shops open.

Do I feed it? If so what? Is the container its in suitable for about 12h or so? I would really apreciate some help here as I really want to do whats best for the animal.

I'd say the best decision here is to retourn it to the shop and explain what happened as we are unexperienced and vastly uninformed when it comes to looking after a fish. Ehat are your thoughts on this? Any help would be really appreciated!

PS: I'm sorry for any bad spelling I wrote this in a rush!

Update: we eded up giving the fish back and hopefully it finds a happy home!",2024-04-15 05:52:06

Cool/unusual pet recommendations?,"I’ve always loved rats, reptiles, bugs, aquatic animals, and otherwise cool/uncommon/creepy crawly critters. My mom hates that sort of thing though, so I’ve never had anything other than cats. But I’m an adult now, with my own apartment, I can do whatever I want to, and I want to get a weird pet.

Specifically, a pet that lives in a tank/terrarium (I have one cat already and want to ensure peaceful/safe co-living, and also a non-enclosed animal would force my poor landlord to charge me another $75 each month for, uhh, “…pet rent…” 🙄). It should also be ‘beginner friendly.’ My key criteria are:

1. lives in a smaller to medium size tank/cage/terrarium
2. doesn’t have an extremely short or long lifespan (around ~5-10 years or so?)
3. friendly, and handleable. I wanna hold my child
4. living requirements/habitat maintenance that isn’t a) super time-cosuming, b) super expensive ongoing, or c) super delicate/easy to mess up and accidentally cause them harm.

My mom hates that sort of thing though, so I’ve never had anything other than cats. But I’m an adult now, with my own apartment, I can do whatever I want to, and I want to get a weird pet.

Specifically, a pet that lives in a tank/terrarium (I have one cat already and want to ensure peaceful/safe co-living, and also a non-enclosed animal would force my poor landlord to charge me another $75 each month for, uhh, “…pet rent…” 🙄). It should also be ‘beginner friendly.’ My key criteria are:

1. lives in a smaller to medium size tank/cage/terrarium
2. doesn’t have an extremely short or long lifespan (around ~5-10 years or so?)
3. friendly, and handleable. I wanna hold my child
4. living requirements/habitat maintenance that isn’t a) super time-cosuming, b) super expensive ongoing, or c) super delicate/easy to mess up and accidentally cause them harm.

I *love* tarantulas, so I would like maybe that or probably a reptile—but I’m definitely open to anything.

Lethargic cat,"I have a female cat she’s around 7 years old. Recently my husband and I moved to a new city and we noticed that she was excessively grooming, she has a bald spot and a rash. We took her to the vet and they said she has miliary dermatitis and they gave her a steroid injection and an antibiotic injection. The visit to the vet was 6 days ago and she still seems very lethargic, low energy, basically just sleeping. She is still eating and drinking but other than that, nothing. I’m wondering if anyone knows if this is normal and/or if these are side effects, how long do they normally last? 

TIA!",2024-04-15 02:37:23

Why is my dog constantly stretching?,"Hey y’all! So I was taking my dog out for a walk and noticed that he was stretching a lot. We would make a few steps and he would start stretching again and again until ultimately he would just lay down and start biting on his leash. So I took him home and he’s still stretching every few seconds. He’s not whimpering or anything and doesn’t limp at all. Idk this is the first time he has done anything like this and I’ve never heard of a dog doing that before and I’m worried because he seems uncomfortable. Have any of you had similar experiences? I’m gonna take him to a vet tomorrow if this persists.

And for context: he’s a 4 year old male border collie mix.

Dog in Cargo vs Cabin,"I'm going through a relationship breakdown and the best thing to come out of it is that my ex agrees our dog would be better off with me.

I will be leaving the UK in June to go back to my home in Texas.

We so far have 2 options to consider in getting my dog back with me:

1) take a flight to Canada where the dog can be in the cabin with me, and then have a layover and fly to DFW with the dog in the cabin
2) take a direct flight from Heathrow to DFW, but with my dog in the cargo hold due to UK laws about pets on planes

I can't decide which would be the most stressful for him. A 7/8 hour flight direct and then its over, or two flights over many hours, but he will be with me the whole time.

I am leaning towards cabin, but I'm just not sure if I'm actually being selfish in this thinking.

Does anyone have any advice or experience doing both options??",2024-04-15 01:09:33

Worried about my boy,"Hello! new to this sub. A bit of backstory! I got my sweet boy, Johnny and his late brother, in 2015 or 2016 from a friend in hebrew school. I was in middle school and living with my parents. Shortly after, they divorced and my mom refused to take responsibility for Johnny. He has lived with my dad consistently since about 2017. I have a difficult relationship with my dad, and have spent the majority of years living with my mom. I visit my cat a lot and have spend periods of time living with him. I don’t believe my father has ever really mistreated him, but Johnny has definitely been treated more as a roommate than a pet you take care of. like I don’t think my dad has ever really played with him and often overfeeds him. Also, the last few years my dad has spent a lot of time traveling with his fiance often scrambling to find someone to feed him. You can all imagine I have been more than anticipatory for an opportunity to have him live with me. Important tidbit on the topic of food, this is THE MOST food motivated cat I have ever met, he is always begging for food, like wakes me up at 5:30 for breakfast. So, monday I moved my dear guy from my dad’s house to my new place that I just got with my best friend. She has two cats who seem to be adjusting fine to the move. Johnny, however, is not fine! The first few days he was sort of normal but meowing a lot, Friday we tried introducing him to my friend’s cats by letting them sniff under each other’s doors and he was pretty bitchy about it, not aggressive but growling. He has been refusing meals since yesterday morning and also refused treats which is VERY strange for him. He threw up two small amounts over the night and he also has not been purring or accepting pets like he usually does. I’ve been playing with him since his first day here, and he also showed no interest in the toy today. What do I do? I know a new place, newish people, and other new cats must be stressful for a him, but i’m seriously pretty worried and seeking guidance! Thanks!",2024-04-15 01:06:15

"Cat is suddenly aggressive to dog, currently pregnant and worried. ","Help on cat and dog relationships.

I have a 7 yr old dog and my husband has a 3 year old cat. They have been fine since we introduced them in August.

They got along well, often play and sometimes even slept next to each other. My dog is pretty chill and not aggressive at all, she gets scared really easily and has never attacked or gone for the cat (or anyone).

Some context:
Dog is mine and my partner began living with us half the week from August with the cat at my apartment.
We got a new place, partner moved first with cat and we joined 10 days later with my 3 year old daughter and dog last month (28 days ago)

On Thursday, the cat attacked our dog completely unprovoked and was aggressive in a way none of us have every seen. My dog got so scared, she peed all over the floor and was shaking really badly. She didn’t seem to have any cuts or injuries. 

We had to remove the dog to a different room in her cage for things to cool down. It seemed fine in morning but in the afternoon, the cat went for her again. 

She ran to her cage where the cat continued to hiss at her until I came from downstairs. 

The cat just went for my dog again, 100% unprovoked, she was just on the rug. The cat chased her to her pen and swiped at her until we could intervene. Let just say there’s blood everywhere and I’m taking my dog to an emergency appointment (it’s a cut under her eye and I’m hoping it’s nothing serious)

I’m ngl my partner is overly obsessed with his cat and ended up sleeping downstairs the first two times saying how his cat is lonely and how we need to let her sleep in our room. 
I have asthma, allergies and I’m currently pregnant so my sleep is terrible. Since the cat wakes me up in the night and my asthma peaks at night, I’ve always made it clear I can’t and won’t have pets in the bedroom. 

He’s now suggesting we buy my dog a bigger enclosure so that we can “keep her safe in there” and I think it’s super unfair. He said that not letting his cat stay free reign will stress her out. But I am noticing my dog showing signs of stress too being closed up. So I can feel this becoming a bit of an issue…

I’m also really annoyed that after the cat attacked the dog, he automatically picks the cat up, strokes her to “calm her down” and uses some bullshit baby voice with her. I admit I lost my shit at him because I feel like he’s reinforcing this negative behaviour. I told him he needs to remove the cat from the room and give her attention after she is relaxed. Is this wrong?!

Surely there’s got to be a reason and some ways to defuse this kind of behaviour. Any help would be fantastic!

I’ve always had dogs and cats and never experienced any issues, I’m also confused why it would become so intense now 9 months without problems ?! I’m guessing the move and stress has reached a threshold for the cat but not really sure how to help things improve. 

I’m also really worried as my 3 year old does not grasp the differences in our dog and cat so I feel it’s only a matter of time before she gets hurt. Plus the paranoia of the cat attacking the newborn, expected in 3 months…

It’s also difficult to have them in a separate room. We have a huge open plan living room, dining kitchen area and my dog usually stays away from the cats area. But the bedrooms upstairs are only enough for us and kids. 

My husband gives the cat lots of attention everyday. I’m also working from home and give her attention when she comes for it. She have lots of special areas, tower and other things.
Both are female and both are neutered. 

Advice please!

***************
Update:
Both pets are booked in to see a vet and rule out medical issues. I’ll look into some stress medication for my doggy and suggest my husband considers the same with the cat.

Windows on the first floor leading towards the stray cats I’ve noticed have been shut for the time being.

We are only allowing them supervised contact right now and seeing if we can create another space for the kitty. Even though it seems pretty tough atm 🙃
(She has high shelves and a massive cat tree on the opposite side of the room/house to the dogs area. )

Feliway defuser is on its way in the post 

Hoping for some positive changes, thanks for the advice and any extra comments are welcome. 

Please avoid telling me to rehome the cat as we are hoping to look into solutions before considering further options: personal stories were rehoming was the outcome are still welcome.

Thank you everyone 🥹",2024-04-15 00:03:56

I’m ngl my partner is overly obsessed with his cat and ended up sleeping downstairs the first two times saying how his cat is lonely and how we need to let her sleep in our room. 
I have asthma, allergies and I’m currently pregnant so my sleep is terrible. Since the cat wakes me up in the night and my asthma peaks at night, I’ve always made it clear I can’t and won’t have pets in the bedroom. 

He’s now suggesting we buy my dog a bigger enclosure so that we can “keep her safe in there” and I think it’s super unfair. He said that not letting his cat stay free reign will stress her out. But I am noticing my dog showing signs of stress too being closed up. So I can feel this becoming a bit of an issue…

I’m also really annoyed that after the cat attacked the dog, he automatically picks the cat up, strokes her to “calm her down” and uses some bullshit baby voice with her. I admit I lost my shit at him because I feel like he’s reinforcing this negative behaviour. I told him he needs to remove the cat from the room and give her attention after she is relaxed. Is this wrong?!

Surely there’s got to be a reason and some ways to defuse this kind of behaviour. Any help would be fantastic!

I’ve always had dogs and cats and never experienced any issues, I’m also confused why it would become so intense now 9 months without problems ?! I’m guessing the move and stress has reached a threshold for the cat but not really sure how to help things improve. 

I’m also really worried as my 3 year old does not grasp the differences in our dog and cat so I feel it’s only a matter of time before she gets hurt. Plus the paranoia of the cat attacking the newborn, expected in 3 months…

It’s also difficult to have them in a separate room. We have a huge open plan living room, dining kitchen area and my dog usually stays away from the cats area. But the bedrooms upstairs are only enough for us and kids. 

My husband gives the cat lots of attention everyday. I’m also working from home and give her attention when she comes for it. She have lots of special areas, tower and other things.
Both are female and both are neutered. 

Advice please!

***************
Update:
Both pets are booked in to see a vet and rule out medical issues. I’ll look into some stress medication for my doggy and suggest my husband considers the same with the cat.

Windows on the first floor leading towards the stray cats I’ve noticed have been shut for the time being.

We are only allowing them supervised contact right now and seeing if we can create another space for the kitty. Even though it seems pretty tough atm 🙃
(She has high shelves and a massive cat tree on the opposite side of the room/house to the dogs area. )

Feliway defuser is on its way in the post 

Hoping for some positive changes, thanks for the advice and any extra comments are welcome. 

Please avoid telling me to rehome the cat as we are hoping to look into solutions before considering further options: personal stories were rehoming was the outcome are still welcome.

Thank you everyone 🥹",2024-04-15 00:03:56
Anyone else w/ a Corso?,"Just wondering how many other Corso owners have a 3yo that still acts 6mo and does the puppy stage ever end? I also have a 6yo Staffy that acts like a puppy still too, is it just healthy happiness or should I be putting my foot down in any way?? ",2024-04-14 22:00:46

Why does my cat love me so much?,"I know this sounds like a bad thing to ask (lol) and while I am very happy she loves me so much, I just don't really understand? All the results I get when I search this up always say they generally gravitate towards whoever looks after their daily needs e.g. feeds them and cleans them litter box but I do none of that. For context, I live with my parents and 2 brothers and my dad is the one who does all of the tasks to look after the cats, and yet shes only bonded to me.

Behaviours I've noticed:

\- She can't leave me alone. She screams in my room when I'm not home, screams when she can't find me and waits outside the bathroom door for me and screams at me when I come out before running back to my room, expecting me to chase her. She follows me all around the house. If I go downstairs, she'll come down too and cuddle up to me, and try and get me to run upstairs back to my room with her.

\- She's obsessed with my scent. She can only sleep on my clothes, bedsheets, or my personal belongings. When I come out the shower with my wet, clean hair, she goes crazy. In a good way it seems. She nuzzles all over it, purrs really loud, and lets me cuddle my head into her stomach while she keeps her head tucked next to mine.

\- She plays with me, which she doesn't like to do with anyone else. She runs expecting me to chase her (she looks back after running for a bit to see if I'm still following and her tail is always up when she does so) and she likes play fighting with me.

\- As soon as I wake up she likes to jump up on me and cuddle with me. She likes to cuddle with her head on my chest and the rest of her body snuggled up in my arm.

All of these things she doesn't do with anyone else, not even the man who feeds her and looks after her.

So why does she like me so much? I don't really get it, I mean is it because I just pet her a lot? Even before she became bonded with me, it's not like I was the only one who pet her and played with her. I don't even remember when she became so obsessed with me, I only really became aware of it a few years ago when my parents pointed it out. It may have to do with the fact that when she was younger I would push her around in a stroller, so maybe she feels more connected to me than the others? I don't know.",2024-04-14 21:28:54

Found dog returned to owners and owners seems a little less than enthusiastic about her return,"My husband and I found this lovely female Pitt in front of house and we were able to keep her safe on our porch until we could figure where she lived/ call the spca in the morning when they are open. We posted on a few neighborhood apps and someone we knew from down our street confirms the house she lives in is her neighbor. This dog seemed well fed, but pretty dirty like covered in dust and her nails were pretty long. No scratches other than on her nose and was very friendly. She also looked like she had recently had puppies in the last few months. When we drove up to the house, it was about 8:30 pm but we had only had this dog for about an hour maybe an hour and a half. The lights were out. We rang their doorbell 3 times. Knocked … finally someone answered the door. When we asked if they were missing a dog they replied non enthusiastically and confirmed her colors. Soooo they come out to the car to get her, she seemed not stoked about getting out of the car. The first boy(he was maybe in his teens) tried to get her out and was like “I dont think she wants to come.” And then tells us he’s going inside to get help.My husband gently lifts her out and we tell the new guy who just came out of the house they can use our collar and leash to take her inside and he said “no I don’t think she’ll run” this man unhooks the leash and collar and grabs her by the neck scruff and PULLS her towards the house. She bolts again, this man chases her down and finally gets her inside the house.   Now, I don’t know about everyone else here but if someone returns my dog to me I would be so stoked that they were home safe. These guys seemed like they didn’t care either way. Which really sucked to see such a sweet friendly dog go to some people that seemed like they could care less, but maybe these people were just not talkative or like extremely introverted? I mean I don’t like strangers either, but if my dog was missing I’d be pretty excited that they were back. Apparently this dog escapes somewhat regularly but I’m kind of wishing this was not how this story ended.

Edit* if we see this dog again, we will be taking her to the humane society/ local spca. 

We have two dogs already, one is a beagle and the other is a 70 pound mixed breed we adopted from the humane society who is a little reactive towards dogs so adopting or housing this dog would be tough. Offering to buy her AT THIS TIME is also not option but is a thought we have already considered/ continue thinking about. But taking this dog to a humane shelter is definitely something we would do.

I mean I don’t like strangers either, but if my dog was missing I’d be pretty excited that they were back. Apparently this dog escapes somewhat regularly but I’m kind of wishing this was not how this story ended.

Edit* if we see this dog again, we will be taking her to the humane society/ local spca. 

We have two dogs already, one is a beagle and the other is a 70 pound mixed breed we adopted from the humane society who is a little reactive towards dogs so adopting or housing this dog would be tough. Offering to buy her AT THIS TIME is also not option but is a thought we have already considered/ continue thinking about. But taking this dog to a humane shelter is definitely something we would do.

Found dog returned to owners and owners seems a little less than enthusiastic about her return,"My husband and I found this lovely female Pitt in front of house and we were able to keep her safe on our porch until we could figure where she lived/ call the spca in the morning when they are open. We posted on a few neighborhood apps and someone we knew from down our street confirms the house she lives in is her neighbor. This dog seemed well fed, but pretty dirty like covered in dust and her nails were pretty long. No scratches other than on her nose and was very friendly. She also looked like she had recently had puppies in the last few months. When we drove up to the house, it was about 8:30 pm but we had only had this dog for about an hour maybe an hour and a half. The lights were out. We rang their doorbell 3 times. Knocked … finally someone answered the door. When we asked if they were missing a dog they replied non enthusiastically and confirmed her colors. Soooo they come out to the car to get her, she seemed not stoked about getting out of the car. The first boy(he was maybe in his teens) tried to get her out and was like “I dont think she wants to come.” And then tells us he’s going inside to get help.My husband gently lifts her out and we tell the new guy who just came out of the house they can use our collar and leash to take her inside and he said “no I don’t think she’ll run” this man unhooks the leash and collar and grabs her by the neck scruff and PULLS her towards the house. She bolts again, this man chases her down and finally gets her inside the house.

"My 2-year-old female cat spends the entire day hissing, growling and attacking seven-month-old kitten (male), I'm stressed, my patience is at zero, and I feel like I've tried everything.","For context, I brought home the male kitten when he was about three months old, maybe a little younger. I did a slow introduction, separate rooms, scent swapping etc, and for the first month they seemed to be becoming friends- playing constantly  (no hissing, growling or other signs of aggression), groomed and occasionally slept together. Then, abruptly, it just started going downhill. My older cat would growl a bit during play which I thought was just a warning because the little one was being too rough, but it happened more and more often and I began to have to separate them. Then she started hissing and growling at his approach, then simply at his existence, and nowadays she will go out of her way to attack him, lunging across the room when he is minding his own business. She doesn't seem to actually be hurting him, but he has started to avoid her (not always, he's still a dumb kitten and does things like scaring the shit out of her by jumping on her back, to which her displeasure is warranted, I think). Furthermore, she began peeing on things, quilts, towels, rugs, jackets, and the floor- I can't let her in my bedroom anymore in case she pees on the new carpet (it's a rental), which also probably doesn't help, since she used to sleep with my every night. She also growls and hisses at me and my brother, which had never happened before, she had always been the sweetest girl, loved to be held. Now I'm lucky to hold her for 30 seconds without being growled and hissed at.

Now for what I've tried, yes, I took her to the vet. They ran tests and found nothing. They put her on pregabalin 25mg (split in half, dosed morning and night). It seemed to be working, but the efficacy seems to have quickly diminished and now two weeks later things are nearly as bad as before.

Feliway spray- I've tried it all through the house, on a collar, it seems to have zero effect.

Feliway multicat diffuser- I think it may have been helping, however I walked past it after a couple weeks and could smell burning and there was either vapour or smoke coming from it, and I no longer felt safe having it in the house ( and neither did the rest of the houses inhabitants).

They have four litter boxes in entirely separate parts of the house, only one of which are covered and two of which are extra large, and the peeing has occurred even when she's standing next to a clean one.

I bought more cat trees, more toys. Unfortunately the older cat has lost all interest in toys since I brought him home (she sometimes still likes a good game of chase though, she hasn't lost all her playfulness).

I've tried separating them, but if I put the kitten in another room he cries so loudly that the older cat paces and hisses and growls in response, and it can go for hours on end, which is stressful for all of us and sets the dog off barking (we live in a house split into two, so the neighbours are just through the wall). If I stay with the kitten, everyone is quiet but I get to spend no time with my older girl and I feel awful for abandoning her.

The odd thing is, she occasionally initiates play with him, and they roll around quietly for a minute or so before growling, then yowling and swiping and other aggression breaks out (from her, not him). She also grooms him sometimes, and they eat together just fine for the most part.

I've ordered some pheromone collars to try as a last ditch effort, and have considered asking the vet about a different medication since the pregabalin seemed to work at first (she was sweet and playful, cuddly, hardly hissing or growling, it felt like I had my girl back).

If anyone has any ideas, even if they're out of the box, I'd love to hear them. I would never want to rehome either of my cats, and even though I'm sure the kitten would settle well anywhere (he is a lovely, gentle giant, super sweet and friendly, and every non-cat person that meets him loves him), even so, it would break my heart placing him with a new family.

I'm tired though, I feel so stressed by the constant aggression, that I'm no longer enjoying the experience of having cats, I just feel like crying most the time and like I'm no longer able to be as patient as I should be, and it hasn't even been that long-- I've read stories on here of people that have been doing this for years, and that just sounds miserable for all of us. Especially my older cat, she can't be happy at the moment. I yelled at her last night because she peed on an expensive puzzle I was working on, and I feel terrible that I lost my temper when she needs me to be patient with her, it's not her fault.

What else can I try? Are reintroductions ever successful? I've considered it but it would be very very difficult, the kitten doesn't do well with being left alone, among other reasons, and most stories I've read on here have found reintroductions pretty unhelpful when they were done correctly in the first place.",2024-04-14 09:46:36

Kitten still has fever after vet," 
Back story: 3.5 old month kitten had minor blood in stool, lethargic, fever. 

We took him to the vet and he had a 105 fever, so the vet gave him fluids, B shot, and antibiotic shot. For the diarrhea we were given 10 days of probiotic powder for his food and 10 days of  Metronidazole 2 times a day. 

He did have his stool tested and it was negative. 
He came from a shelter that does all the proper testing and diagnoses before adoption. He is FIV/FEVL negative! 

After the vet visit he started to perk up, and the next day was about 80% back to his normal self. Well today he's right back to where he was. Soft stool, lethargic, and feels very warm, most likely a fever. 

Can anyone give any advice? Does it just take some time for the kittens to get better and for their fevers to break? Any suggestions would really help! The vet is closed tomorrow so unless he gets much worse, we will call Monday. 

Thank you!",2024-04-14 09:37:41

Either really bad...or just poop,"My Darla (domestic short hair cat, 3.5 years) vomited 5 times in 30 hours from Thursday-Friday but was acting completely normal otherwise. I took her to one vet who basically told me she felt a mass and the prognosis would likely not be good and it was probs lymphoma. I went to a well known vet hospital the next day to get an ultrasound and they said they thought the first vet jumped to the worse inappropriately and they thought it was probably constipation or foreign object. They gave her miralax (Saturday at 1pm) to hopefully get her to poop but she hasn't still since Friday morning.

Both vets gave anti-nausea and Darla came home from both appointments really lethargic despite being fine before. She ate on Sat morning but less than normal and then vomited on Sat night. She did not want food Sat night. She has been drinking water throughout but did not want food again this morning (Sunday). She is walking around a little now but still not herself.

Taking her to vet again tomorrow to check but wanted to see if anyone else had similar experiences with reaction to meds or what it could be? Be kind and gentle please she is my baby.

Anxious re-homed cat ,"Hello, we re-homed our 3 year old cat in August. She is the most anxious cat I have ever had and I am unsure how to proceed? She is an indoor cat. 

We are unsure if she was abused in her original home but she is incredibly jumpy, does not trust us even after 9 months of being with us. Any slight noise in The house or outside and she runs to hide 🥺

She spends the entire day sleeping/hiding under our bedroom duvet, even when we are home, and will come downstairs to the living room at night. She wants love and attention but seems scared to approach. She will headbutt us for a few strokes and then will have enough and walk away. We never EVER see her sleeping; she never sits down with us or near us, it is very rare. She seems to not want to let her guard down and is always anticipating something bad. 

We have tried catnip (no effect) and feliway and still use it but just not sure if this will improve? 🥺 She likes treats but is always unsure if there is a “catch” so does not go for them all the time. she plays with us sometimes in the evening but just does not trust us or want to be near us most of the time. 

Any advice???? We do everything on her terms and let her come to us but just wondering if this will get better? ❤️‍🩹 ",2024-04-14 05:19:37

We are unsure if she was abused in her original home but she is incredibly jumpy, does not trust us even after 9 months of being with us. Any slight noise in The house or outside and she runs to hide 🥺

She spends the entire day sleeping/hiding under our bedroom duvet, even when we are home, and will come downstairs to the living room at night. She wants love and attention but seems scared to approach. She will headbutt us for a few strokes and then will have enough and walk away. We never EVER see her sleeping; she never sits down with us or near us, it is very rare. She seems to not want to let her guard down and is always anticipating something bad. 

We have tried catnip (no effect) and feliway and still use it but just not sure if this will improve? 🥺 She likes treats but is always unsure if there is a “catch” so does not go for them all the time. she plays with us sometimes in the evening but just does not trust us or want to be near us most of the time. 

Any advice???? We do everything on her terms and let her come to us but just wondering if this will get better? ❤️‍🩹 ",2024-04-14 05:19:37

Can I get rabies from my pet cat?,"I'm really anxious because I'm worried I might have rabies. Today, I noticed that I have a higher libido than usual, and when I searched online, I found an article suggesting that this could be a symptom of rabies. This got me thinking about my cat, who scratched me quite a bit recently. Last autumn, my cat was bitten by a dog, as it has plenty of outdoor access. Now, I'm concerned that I might have contracted rabies from my cat, even though it's not showing any symptoms. This line of thinking is really frightening me. Also, I live in Romania, if that's relevant.",2024-04-14 04:38:42

Cat agreesive ,"We got our cat 6 years ago. 

He has had a lot of medical issues over the years. 

He had femoral head resection due to having hip dysplasia. This was at a year old and he got better and has no issues now from it. 

He is very weird about food. Can't be free fed. So we have an auto feeder and his sibling gets free fed on the counter as he is to scared to jump that high.

We noticed he was eating things he shouldn't have been IE he swallowed 6 inches of packing tape and I have no idea even where he got that tape. We have been soo careful to make sure that he doesn't find anything else. 

The vet about 3 years ago let me know our cat is essentially mentally not all the way there and that we need to treat him as such. We moved and got a new vet. Found out he has medical issues. He gets constipated, has to be on 2 laxatives all the time, special food for his stomach. 

We found he was starting to act aggressive before the tummy issues and decided to put him on gabapentin as needed to help his brain calm down. Well then he started to realize that is he attacked another cat he got the gabopentin and would sit by the fridge. 

He only likes me and no one else. Lately he has gotten worse. He would only attack another cat every once in awhile when he was very upset. Then it turned to once a week and now it is daily. We don't know what else to do. We have tried meds, food changes, feedings different. Every med the vet recommended. We have poured more money into this cat than we ever wanted to approx $7000 over his life. At this point do we just put him down. He can't be happy if he is doing this and now my other cats are terrified. 

Help please",2024-04-14 03:25:44

How many pets is too many? ,"Hello! This might sound like overthinking but tbh I’m the queen of overthinking 

So to keep it short my wife (28f) and I (23f) are looking to purchase a house. We currently have 2 dogs, an Italian greyhound/chi mix and an Italian greyhound/jack russel mix. 

When we move we want more pets and one child. I have lupus so I can’t commit to taking on too many pets (if it were up to me, I would have considered moving out to the country to have a horse or lambs or chickens but I can’t handle sun exposure for long periods of time :( dreams *crushed*) 
But ideally I would like to have 

* our current two puppies 
* 2 Scottish fold cats 
* 1 Italian greyhound / whippet (if the whippet can be trusted with our future cats and current dogs, still researching and really taking our time with this decision) 
* 2 ferrets
* 1 human child 

So my questions is, how large of a house should we purchase to realistically make my dream a reality? I’ve read about 200 SQft per animal, but I don’t know if that’s too small?? 

Also I didn’t mention the ferrets and dogs interacting in our decision between an Italian greyhound or whippet because I’ll never let the ferrets interact with our other animal regardless of breed. 

Edit: I’ll have to reconsider the breed of cat we originally wanted, but I’m sure there’s a lot of beautiful cat breeds to consider ",2024-04-14 02:13:52

Cat is terrified of new dog. Looking for advice,"We have a Rottweiler/lab mix (piper) who has been with us for about 9 years and rescued a cat (Gary) about 3 years ago. Recently, we adopted a German shepherd/doberman (Otis)  mix who is about 16 months old. 

Gary is very used to piper and we have had no issues. Even in the beginning when we brought him home. Piper sniffed him, Gary hissed and piper walked off. 

This was not the case with brining Otis home. Otis is far more persistent and hasnt yet has the chance to learn how sharp cats can be when needed. Gary is down right terrified of Otis, who just wants to play and chase Gary around. Gary has now decided that his only safe place is the basement where Otis doesn't have access (we cut a cat hole in the door). 

We hate this as our basement is cold, unfinished and dark. We want Gary to feel safe being upstairs and lounging and spending time with us like he used to. 

I know that the process can take months. I've already rubbed some towels on Otis and brought them downstairs to Gary. When he smells them I give him treats as a positive reinforcement. 

We talked about a few different methods, such as, getting a gentle lead and putting it on Otis and reintroducing him to Gary, or letting Gary straight up claw Otis to show him the consequences of going for the cat, or even using pipers calming meds (she hates getting her nails clipped so we have them for her and then bring her in) on Otis to introduce him to gary. 


I would really appreciate some input on what we should do and how consistent we need to be. Thank you. ",2024-04-13 23:14:54

"Neighbour’s dog keeps “escaping” - what should I do, if anything?","Hi all

New to this sub so I’m not sure if these kinds of posts are allowed. I’m looking for advice about my neighbour’s dog (Charlie) as I’m genuinely concerned. For context I live in the UK.

A few months ago, we woke up and went downstairs to find Charlie, who lives two roads over, just chilling in our garden. **edit: he would’ve jumped two fences to end up in our garden. They’re high fences, too!

He seemed happy and we checked him over for injuries etc and he had none. We contacted our local vet and took him there. 

We since discovered that he’d been left alone in his house for days, so no wonder the poor thing escaped. 

This morning around 4am, it sounded as though the same thing happened. I could hear my neighbour screaming at the dog to get back. The whole thing was awful and the screaming and yelling very distressing. 

Are there any common reasons a dog would repeatedly try and escape? Is this just dog behaviour? I have never owned one and simply don’t know, and don’t want to judge this neighbour too harshly in the first instance. Thanks for any advice. ",2024-04-13 23:01:44

Weird encounter and dog walking and peeing,"Had a weird encounter the other day with a guy and questioning etiquette with the dog on the street. Few days ago I’m out for the evening walk with the dog. He’s doing his thing and sniffing and getting the news like beagles usually do. We come up to what I call a tree box in the city.

Tree boxes are little enclosures around a tree that is between the street and sidewalk. Typically there’s a tree then a little bit of grass/ mulch/dirt with maybe plantings. Sometimes there’s a little calf-high barrier around them. There’s basically three types, well kept ones with flowers or manicured bushes and grass or mulch. Decent ones with either just grass or mulch and maybe an unkept bush, and unmaintained ones that are just dirt/mulch. Some tree boxes even have little signs either asking dogs to either stay out of or to come enjoy a potty break.

My dog goes into the second type. It has no signage, some mulch in it, and a small bush that doesn’t look like any pruning has been done this year. It’s in front of a commercial building. He pees in the mulch and then does a scoot-scoot action where he kicks out his hind legs which throws a little mulch into the road. My dog only randomly does the scoot-scoot after peeing and maybe does it once every two or three walks.

Some random guy passing by yells at me and says that my beagle is a bad dog for doing that. He says I should train my dog not to do that. I tell him I can’t stop my dog from doing that (aside from jerking his leash). He then says people work hard on those tree boxes and yells that I’m a bad owner and my dog is an asshole. I tell him he’s an idiot and to fuck off. He then reiterates what a bad owner I am while walking beside me before I turn to go a different direction.

So my question is do people train their dogs not to scoot scoot? I’ve never heard of this. I’m respectful of signage in the tree boxes and keep my dog out of the well-manicured ones. But I don’t think it’s possible or natural to stop the scoot scooting.",2024-04-13 22:20:19

Decent ones with either just grass or mulch and maybe an unkept bush, and unmaintained ones that are just dirt/mulch. Some tree boxes even have little signs either asking dogs to either stay out of or to come enjoy a potty break.

My dog goes into the second type. It has no signage, some mulch in it, and a small bush that doesn’t look like any pruning has been done this year. It’s in front of a commercial building. He pees in the mulch and then does a scoot-scoot action where he kicks out his hind legs which throws a little mulch into the road. My dog only randomly does the scoot-scoot after peeing and maybe does it once every two or three walks.

Some random guy passing by yells at me and says that my beagle is a bad dog for doing that. He says I should train my dog not to do that. I tell him I can’t stop my dog from doing that (aside from jerking his leash). He then says people work hard on those tree boxes and yells that I’m a bad owner and my dog is an asshole. I tell him he’s an idiot and to fuck off. He then reiterates what a bad owner I am while walking beside me before I turn to go a different direction.

So my question is do people train their dogs not to scoot scoot? I’ve never heard of this. I’m respectful of signage in the tree boxes and keep my dog out of the well-manicured ones. But I don’t think it’s possible or natural to stop the scoot scooting.",2024-04-13 22:20:19
Weird encounter and dog walking and peeing,"Had a weird encounter the other day with a guy and questioning etiquette with the dog on the street. Few days ago I’m out for the evening walk with the dog. He’s doing his thing and sniffing and getting the news like beagles usually do. We come up to what I call a tree box in the city.

Liver issue/what should I check at the vet? ,"Hello everyone
I'm looking for a solution and I'm desperate. My dog(bichon frise-10y)has liver problems and I have done the tests 5 times and they always fluctuate. I can't figure out where I'm doing wrong. He also did urine tests, glycemic test, ultrasound 3 times. He receives liver supplements, grain food and wet food for liver problems. When he was tested the first time, he also had sand in his bladder, so the first time he received urinary treatment and royal canin urinary food, which was changed to royal canin liver, now that I have redone the tests and they are as bad as in December, even in February after 3 months of urinary food, the analyzes were much better, not perfect but twice as good. The liver supplements were given daily, I give them at the vet's recommendation, hepatic forte liquid, a capsule from vetexpert. Now she is 100% on liver food, she is doing as bad as in January and only the grains have been changed.
What analyzes should he do? The vet and I don't understand what's wrong and I think he thinks I'm not following the diet even though I'm very strict. Thanks if you've read this far and any ideas are helpful!Below I leave the analyzes that came out particularly bad, so there are more markers in the list:
1. Alanine aminotransferase (GPT/ALT/ALT)
507 (result) value range acceptable:
8 - 125 IU/L

2. Aspartate aminotransferase (GOT/SAT/AST)
58 is the result
< 50 IU/L should be within the acceptable range

3. Uric acid (URIC) is <10.00 and a good value is just below but not too low < 60 umol/L",2024-04-13 20:11:48

My 4 Year Cat Is Acting Strange,"My Cat Is Strangely Meowing and Uneasy  
  
I have a total of six cats: two adult cats, two five-month-old cats, and two three-week-old kittens. Just this morning, my eldest cat started meowing weirdly. It’s as if she is trying to tell us something, and she looks very uneasy. She also licks all the cats, including her ginger frenemy cat. Her behavior is very strange; she even rested as if she is trying to act like the mother of the two kittens.  
  
On the side note, our ginger cat, who recently gave birth, looks so weak. She is very thin, and we think that there is no more milk coming out from her because she is not eating frequently. We suspect she is sick, and we noticed that she doesn’t want to breastfeed her kittens anymore.  
  
Could my eldest cat sense that there is something wrong with the mom of the two kittens, and is she trying to take over the mom role?  
  
I am not sure what is going on",2024-04-13 18:57:07

Help me take care of baby pigeon ,"It’s been almost four days since this baby pigeon appeared in my yard. I have zero experience with birds or how to take care of them. I tried to offer food and water but not sure if it is eating anything poor baby keeps running away. 

I’m afraid it will die. Any suggestions on how to take care of it until it can depend on itself?

Here’s some details one might need to understand the situation:
1- the pigeon I believe is called the Brown Pigeon or the Mourning Dove. 
2- it’s eyes are opened the feathers has grown.
3- I took a gift box and filled it with sawdust (the one used for hamsters) and put two containers for water and bird food.

7 things you can do after your pet pass away ,"
Whether it's a pet or us, there will come a day when we leave this world, but for pets, that day seems to come sooner. For those who haven't experienced losing a pet, they may be afraid to start having one.

We don't know when the sadness of losing a pet will end, but trying to do these things might help with the recovery of emotions.

**1.Give Yourself Time to Grieve**

Before the pet leaves, we can smile and send it off. When it really leaves, please don't hold back your tears. Don't worry too much about what others might think; cry when you feel like it. Sometimes a good cry can relieve most of the sadness. Enduring it only makes the grief harder to erase.

**2.Write a Letter to Your Pet**

If you don't know what to do after your pet leaves, write a letter. We can write a thank-you letter to our pet, write about its reaction when it first came home, write about its reactions every time we bought gifts, or record all its little habits. After writing, please keep this letter safe and read it again when you think of it.

**3.Hold a Simple Funeral for Your Pet**

Owners can hold a simple funeral for their dog, it doesn't have to be too grand. Just a private farewell between the owner and the pet. At the last moments of life, quietly express the inner reluctance to part with the beloved pet and make a promise to meet again in the next life.

**4.Customize a Stuffed Animal Replica**

This way, you can embrace it once again, forever having it with you. Regardless, this is a relatively simple and executable solution at the moment.

**5.Visit Your Pet's Favorite Place One Last Time**

We can visit our pet's favorite place one last time, walk the route it always took, greet its favorite playmates, and reminisce about the joy with our pet.

**6**.**Don't Let Your Pet's Companion Grieve Together**

If there are other pets at home, please don't inform them that my best friend has left, let them know that you have left here. Pets also have emotions, and sometimes the death of a companion can elicit a bigger reaction from them than from us, and sometimes they may choose to leave together.

**7.Volunteer Experience**

When you have time, try volunteering at a shelter to take care of pets and feed them. Being surrounded by furry friends might make you feel a little better.",2024-04-13 14:53:55

My cat ran away for 2 days and came back with a bloody nose.

I looked everywhere and searched within about 400-500 meters of our house but nothing.

I woke up to a commotion 2 days later outside our door, there were about 8 cats fighting and mine was in the pile. 
(For context, we live in an apartment but left the door  open in case the cat came back at night. Other cats probably wanted the free warmth and the somehow started fighting) 

The second I opened the door, my cat blitzed inside before I could even notice her. At that moment I was so relieved I didn't notice she had some weird scars on her nose.

The vertical line in the middle of her nose was bleeding, and there were smaller injuries around her mouth as well. She has fought a lot of cats before and usually doesn't get injured, even when she does it's on her body.

This particular one was unusual and it had a lot of mucus/blood around, also she was sneezing for a little while after she came back so I'm concerned for her wellbeing.

Is it a normal injury from fights or should I get it checked for possible infections?",2024-04-13 13:48:23

HELP!! Sisters cat bonded to me ,"I’m really struggling with this… so I am 22 and about to move out of my mom’s house. I have two cats who I have had for 7 years and am going to be taking them with me. My little sister who also lives in the house has two cats as well. Misty, is a senior kitty she adopted 3 years ago. In the past year Misty has really bonded with me. She refuses to sleep in my sisters room and only ever wants to be with me. My sister does not seem to care about it. The issue is that I feel extremely guilty because I’m moving in a month and can’t take her with me for various reasons. 

How can I get her to rebond with my sister? ",2024-04-13 12:04:19

Fence Fighting ,"Any tips on getting a dog to stop fence fighting?
My Rottweiler has been going after the dogs next door and it's almost every time he's outside, it doesn't help that the dogs next door are extremely aggressive and the guy doesn't do anything about it.

I can't keep waiting hours for my dog to go outside because the nextdoor neighbors dogs are out all day, I don't know what to do.

If I can't get him to stop my fiance will make me get rid of them and I really don't want to.

Flying with pets,"Hello!

I'm planning on flying with my cat from the Middle East to Northeast US, which would likely require a stop in Europe and using two different airlines. I tried to find info about it online and couldn't find anything.

If I book my flight through airline A, and they say that I have to pay X amount for one way (origin to destination), does that only include the flight actually operated by airline A or both flights?

Also, I understood that for British Airways you cannot carry a cat in cabin and have to use a third party. However, I saw that the third party only does from the UK and to the UK, but I am just having a layover. Anyone have any experience with that?

I still haven't chosen a flight/airline as I am exploring all options.

You are welcome to ask any clarifying questions. 

Thank you!",2024-04-13 09:06:42

What to do about our pet aggressiveness/roughness with our child?,"So we have a dog (heeler-mix, pushing 100 lbs) that has some aggressive tendencies. We’ve put him in numerous classes and nothing has really worked. Before we had a child, it was fine because we just made sure he was always leashed and watched him closely whenever we were out and about.

But now, we have major concerns with him being around our toddler. Best case scenario, we have to constantly hover our child so he doesn’t just accidentally knock him over. He tends to have the zoomies constantly and like literally will even run into us at full speed like a wrecking ball. And then he’s also nipped at our child, for no real good reason (e.g. child goes to pick up a ball). We see this behavior escalating as our child gets older. The only other option is for us to constantly keep them separated but that’s not really feasible. 

We love him very much, but our child is obviously the higher priority. We looked into surrendering him but our local municipal animal shelter will not take aggressive pets. For the same reason, other people aren’t willing either (we’ve posted on social media and reached out to pet rescues).

We were thinking we were not the only ones who has run into these issues before, so we’re reaching out to see what you all have done in this situation.",2024-04-13 08:11:22

Time for euthanasia? ,"This is my first dog and never been through this, had him since a puppy. He's a 12 year old German Shepherd that has degenerative myelopathy. Both of his hind legs don't work so he's pretty immobile (we use a wheelchair for walks). He's recently been incontinent and doesn't even know when he's gone to the bathroom. Due to that he requires a lot of baths, wipes and has developed a rash/skin condition on his crotch that I'm treating. Other than that he eats and drinks normally, still barks, enjoys walks etc. We have a baby in the house and my wife is worried about sanitation (he has diapers now) and I know he's only going to continue downhill. If we don't walk him he basically just sits around all day on his bed. He's not in pain, just frustrated. I feel his quality of life isn't so good and it's hard for me to go through with it. Any advice from someone that's been through it? Is it time? Ugh this sucks.",2024-04-13 07:28:22

Red Inner Eyelids,"I went to a pet store today, and saw a dog with **conjunctivitis**. It was in the window, a platform above the kittens they were selling. A surprisingly tall puppy, seemed like a designer breed. Poodle mix, maybe.

Not just conjunctivitis, but the **inner parts to the bottom of his inner eye tissue was sticking out entirely**. Similar to the long red inner eyelids that basset hounds have, but condensed solely into one area. It looks like it's been there for a long time.

It made me feel sad. He looked at me, and a mom with a little girl looking at the kittens, with a lightly wagging tail. He looked at me again when I left, sort of with this, ''oh..'' feeling to his posture and look.

Like he was asking to just get out of there. Like he's seen so many people go by in and out for his entire life.  
It made me feel sad.

Knowing these dogs are often bred from puppy mills for profit to be a luxury ''item'' made me feel even sadder. Quite literally put in a tank by itself on the top to draw attention to it specifically.

Knowing alot of these pet store dogs are just going to end up in the rescue system or with severe illness or death due to terrible breeding, or bought out by some backyard breeder.

The fact that these animals are condemned to a life of suffering, being bred this way until adoption with a chance they won't go to an owner that actually gives a damn about them as an individual and not just as a status symbol.. it's daunting.

It's painful.",2024-04-13 04:55:35

"My Cat is feeling better, how much should I feed her. ","My 15yo calico was at the vet all morning after not eating or drinking for 36 hours, and a total loss of personality. They did the exam, bw and urine. She most likely has a mass on or near her liver. The vet and I decided to not to X-rays or ultrasound at this time, partially cause they have to wait till Monday anyway, and partially cause at her age, if we find something, we most likely won’t go ahead with surgery/chemo as is. Going to monitor over the weekend, and make a plan from there. I adore my vet and she was amazing, explained everything in a way I understood and could relate to my knowledge of the human body (nurse).  

We’re home now, and she took the meds ok for me. One was an appetite stimulant, and she’s eating now and drank a bit too! But she’s always had a sensitive stomach, and a habit of eating wet food too fast. I’m now worried about feeding her too much too quickly. Should I let her eat as she wants, or continue to slowly ease her into it?  She has full access to water.   

I’ve already called the vet with questions twice since we got home, I think my background is a case of knowing too much and not enough. I keep thinking through scenarios, realizing I don’t know the answer for cats, and getting nervous. 

TIA 💜
 
ETA: Sorry also the vet did an u/s to get the urine, it’s not a sensitive diagnostic u/s, but she did say there was something there that shouldn’t be, and the spot was tender when examined. I forgot that in the post. ",2024-04-13 04:54:54

Cat Camera In Crate?,"Hello,

I’m in Canada and thinking about moving to the UK. I started doing the research to take my three cats with me because I’m not going to leave them behind. I’ve always hated, hated, HATED the concept of cargo hold plane transportation and I’m frankly heartbroken that the UK requires it for inbound pet plane travel. I want to do everything I can to ensure that if I do have to force them to travel in a dark, scary cargo hold that I can do so and monitor them the entire time.

I’ve already looked into these fancy collars by PetPace that not only provide GPS location but also track health things like heart rate and temperature. But what I’m curious about is a camera, that would have to be battery powered lasting longer than 8 hours, that I could stick in each of their crates and I’d use my phone to check in on them. Is such a thing possible, or even exist?

If anyone has any advice for cargo hold pet travel I’d also be grateful. I hate the concept but I don’t see another option unless I want to fly to France and then drive the rest of the way.",2024-04-13 04:01:31
Cat Camera In Crate?,"Hello,

I’m in Canada and thinking about moving to the UK. I started doing the research to take my three cats with me because I’m not going to leave them behind. I’ve always hated, hated, HATED the concept of cargo hold plane transportation and I’m frankly heartbroken that the UK requires it for inbound pet plane travel. I want to do everything I can to ensure that if I do have to force them to travel in a dark, scary cargo hold that I can do so and monitor them the entire time.

Cat constantly screaming & scratching at the door?,"We have an 8yr moggy ginger cat. Male, neutered, little bit chunky. We also have a puppy who he does not like. At the end of Feb I lost my baby girl. She was a spayed moggy calico, about 15mo older than him. We got both cats as kittens - female around 7/8 weeks & male cat at 6 weeks.

He never really liked the puppy but was fine staying upstairs. Since our female cat passed, though, he has been impossible. Our downstairs door is shut and he will just scratch and scream at it constantly. 

He doesn't need anything. He has my sister (he has awful separation anxiety from her and is 10x worse when she leaves). He has clean litter, biscuits and water. Toys. His own bedroom. Full run of my room and my sisters with her.

The only way we can make him be quiet is by feeding him wet food but he's seriously getting fat. He's like 15lbs and his ideal is 12lbs. 

I think he's grieving and also hates the dog. Which is valid. But I literally feel like putting him outside half the time. He just doesn't stop.

If we open the door he runs straight to his food bowl. If we ignore him he just screams.

Do we just wait this out? I feel like he hates his life and he's literally driving us all insane. He's irritating us all to the point of arguments because unless we feed him 24/7 he will not stop.

Any help would be nice. ",2024-04-13 03:36:39

Give up my pets. ,"Hi guys. I’m 24F and wanted to share my experience with you because I seriously don’t know what to do and I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. I have three Guinea pigs and originally I only intended to have one which I adopted. I was super content just him and I and he’s going to be 6 this year. His brothers are 5 & 2. Pig #2 & #3 were impulsive decisions-#2 was my moms decision and admittedly, #3 was mine (I was recently diagnosed with ADHD & it helped me understand that my impulsiveness is a trait) but long story short, I’m growing tired of taking care of them. #3 can’t even be near #1 & #2 because he’s too dominant and starts fighting with #2. #2 used to be rowdy but as he’s gotten older he’s calmed down more & #1 has always been a calm, friendly, food motivated piggy. Probably my best behaved baby. Anyways, I’ve had them for a total of about 6 years and I find that I’m just getting tired of constantly cleaning their cage, having to do laundry more often now to clean their liners, spending $$$ on food & hay which I’ve learned to buy in bulk, and the worst part is that I’m young and I want to do things like travel more, go out but I feel so bound by my pets. I’m just in a period of my life where I want to stop feeling bound to my home life in general. I want to spend more time in my LDR where he lives but because of the pigs, I feel like I can’t go anywhere for long because the only one that takes care of them when I’m gone is my mom and I know it’s a lot for her too as she has a lot on her plate. Sometimes I wish I just would’ve stuck with #1 even tho 2 pigs is ideal, but he was always by himself and sometimes I feel horrible cause #2 likes to dominate him too. At the same time though I’m also very hard on myself so I feel like I’d be really hard on myself for getting rid of them. Idk what to do. Their space isn’t the best either as it’s one cage split down the middle cause I have to keep #3 separate. I’ve also developed allergies over the years to them so I can’t hold them without breaking out into itchy red spots. My mom says that she can help with cleaning the cage etc but she doesn’t understand that she’s not the one having to worry about not being able to live her life properly because of how bound she feels to her piggies. I’ve had them since was 18 and I’ve pushed passed the allergic reactions, the feeling of getting overwhelmed having to clean but also being hard on myself that I can’t give them a proper space. I sincerely wish I would’ve just stuck with one. I’m just so conflicted because I love animals and believe that they’re family. But it is getting to a point where it feels draining.

Neglected puppy in danger,"There is a house at the end of a neighboring street that is a corner lot. The road is perpendicular with a really busy road. For the past week, I’ve noticed they’ve gotten a puppy but the puppy is left in the front yard, which is unfenced. It’s frequently wandering into the road and I’ve watched it almost get hit a couple times. 

I thought it was a stray because it’s dirty, was eating garbage (bags that are left in the front yard), has no collar. But decided to knock on the door and ask. Someone answered and they said it was their dog. I told them it had been in the street and almost gotten hit and they shrugged and closed the door on me.

There was a styrofoam cup with water but by the next day the puppy had torn that up. It seems like she is eating out of the garbage. 

Animal control here won’t do anything.

My plan is to leave a note offering to buy the puppy cash. I don’t know what else to do. The puppy is going to end up hit or stolen or continue to live a miserable life (which sadly many dogs do around here).

Update: I left a note offering to buy the puppy. Fingers crossed they check their mailbox and reach out. I used a Google voice number so nothing can be connected to my identity. ",2024-04-12 22:58:51

Cat Soft Tissue Sarcoma/Fibrosarcoma Diagnosis and Treatment Questions,"Hello!  
Hoping to hear from others who have been through a soft tissue sarcoma or fibrosarcoma diagnosis and treatment journey with their cats. Here's a brief overview and then I'm also going to copy/paste some info from the pathology report in case anyone has knowledge/insight into that.

  
**November 2023-** noticed a lump on our cat, Buddha's, left hip. Popped up quickly and grew fast over 2 weeks, so vet removed it. The mass was attached to his abdominal wall muscle, so required some excision of muscle tissue too. Got clean margins and sent sample to pathology. Pathology confirmed clean margins and gave diagnosis of fibrosarcoma. Buddha was an ex street cat (also FIV+) who had a lot of scar tissue from fights, so the vet said she thinks it was likely related to trauma to his skin/tissue from fighting that triggered the fibrosarcoma, similar to injection site sarcomas. Advice was just to watch him for new lumps, but he had no other signs of cancer or metastasis. He recovered quickly from the surgery and was back to normal.

  
**April 2024 (last week)**- noticed another lump, in almost the exact same location as the first but on his right hip. Knowing how quickly the other one grew the vet immediately decided to remove it instead of monitor the growth. Again she felt like she got clean margins and this lump was a little smaller, but also attached to abdominal wall muscle. Sent to pathology again. Results came back from pathology yesterday- this mass had more lymphocyte activity than the first one, and they also found microscopic nodules in the margins, so concern that they didn't get it all. This pathology report gave a more general diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma and said it could be fibrosarcoma but the high lymphocyte activity suggests possible lymphosarcoma. His lymph nodes were normal on exam.  
Our vet is suggesting a consult with an oncologist, which we will likely do, to determine a more accurate diagnosis, grade, and prognosis and treatment plan. Our vet feels that prognosis is likely not great since the second mass popped up less than 6 months later and had greater lymphocyte activity which suggest higher risk for metastasis and aggressive nature. We are very tight financially at the moment and I don't think we could afford chemo/radiation treatment. Alternate plan is to just keep monitoring him, removing any more lumps that are removable, and trying to boost his immune system as much as possible. So we are just really not sure how to proceed and hoping for some insight from others who have had similar diagnosis and treatment plans that were helpful in prolonging life. Thanks!



**Here are the descriptions from the pathology reports:**

  
**From first mass in November 2023-** ""The mass appears completely excised and is approximately 2 mm from the cut deep margins. Of note, the trimming notes indicated that only blue and green markings were evident at the time of trimming; the other color may have washed off. A poorly demarcated mass is located in the panniculus. The mass is composed of interlacing streams and bundles of spindle cells that are supported by a collagenous stroma. The spindle cells have indistinct cell borders, scant to small amounts of acidophilic cytoplasm, and one elongated nucleus that contains one nucleolus and/or clumped chromatin. The cells exhibit moderate atypia and there are 9 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields. Scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells are located throughout the mass. A lymphoid nodule is located subjacent to the mass; the nodule is within normal limits. Blood vessels throughout the panniculus are multifocally cuffed low numbers of mononuclear inflammatory cells.""

  
**From second mass last week-** ""Differentials for this mass include fibrosarcoma or possible T cell rich B cell lymphosarcoma. In some nodules the spindle cell population is the dominant population and in other nodules the lymphocyte population is more prominent. Lymphocytic inflammation can be prominent in fibrosarcomas. The presence of a large number of heterogenous lymphocytes with B cells approximately 40% of the population as well as multinucleated giant cells was justification for including T cell rich B cell lymphosarcoma as a possible differential. However, this type of lymphosarcoma is rare in cats and reports in the literature describe the typical presentation as a single enlarged lymph node in the neck (which is not the case here). T cell rich B cell lymphosarcoma can also present clinically as multicentric masses across multiple organs.

  
Subcutis (right flank per history): Throughout the subcutis are variably sized nodular masses that are infiltrative in nature with occasional separation of myofibers. Nodules are composed of varying numbers of streams of spindle cells and lymphocytes (small T and large B cells). In some nodules spindle cells are more prominent and others the lymphocytes cell population is more numerous. Spindle cells have indistinct cell borders, small amounts of acidophilic cytoplasm and oval to elongated nuclei with clumped chromatin of occasional prominent nucleoli. Occasional multinucleated giant cells are interspersed within the nodules. Mitotic count is 6 per 10 400x hpf. Multifocally, nodular masses abut specimen margins.""",2024-04-12 22:26:17

Cat Soft Tissue Sarcoma/Fibrosarcoma Diagnosis and Treatment Questions,"Hello!  
Hoping to hear from others who have been through a soft tissue sarcoma or fibrosarcoma diagnosis and treatment journey with their cats. Here's a brief overview and then I'm also going to copy/paste some info from the pathology report in case anyone has knowledge/insight into that.

  
**November 2023-** noticed a lump on our cat, Buddha's, left hip. Popped up quickly and grew fast over 2 weeks, so vet removed it. The mass was attached to his abdominal wall muscle, so required some excision of muscle tissue too. Got clean margins and sent sample to pathology. Pathology confirmed clean margins and gave diagnosis of fibrosarcoma. Buddha was an ex street cat (also FIV+) who had a lot of scar tissue from fights, so the vet said she thinks it was likely related to trauma to his skin/tissue from fighting that triggered the fibrosarcoma, similar to injection site sarcomas. Advice was just to watch him for new lumps, but he had no other signs of cancer or metastasis. He recovered quickly from the surgery and was back to normal.

  
**April 2024 (last week)**- noticed another lump, in almost the exact same location as the first but on his right hip. Knowing how quickly the other one grew the vet immediately decided to remove it instead of monitor the growth. Again she felt like she got clean margins and this lump was a little smaller, but also attached to abdominal wall muscle. Sent to pathology again. Results came back from pathology yesterday- this mass had more lymphocyte activity than the first one, and they also found microscopic nodules in the margins, so concern that they didn't get it all. This pathology report gave a more general diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma and said it could be fibrosarcoma but the high lymphocyte activity suggests possible lymphosarcoma. His lymph nodes were normal on exam.  
Our vet is suggesting a consult with an oncologist, which we will likely do, to determine a more accurate diagnosis, grade, and prognosis and treatment plan. Our vet feels that prognosis is likely not great since the second mass popped up less than 6 months later and had greater lymphocyte activity which suggest higher risk for metastasis and aggressive nature. We are very tight financially at the moment and I don't think we could afford chemo/radiation treatment. Alternate plan is to just keep monitoring him, removing any more lumps that are removable, and trying to boost his immune system as much as possible. So we are just really not sure how to proceed and hoping for some insight from others who have had similar diagnosis and treatment plans that were helpful in prolonging life. Thanks!



**Here are the descriptions from the pathology reports:**

  
**From first mass in November 2023-** ""The mass appears completely excised and is approximately 2 mm from the cut deep margins. Of note, the trimming notes indicated that only blue and green markings were evident at the time of trimming; the other color may have washed off. A poorly demarcated mass is located in the panniculus. The mass is composed of interlacing streams and bundles of spindle cells that are supported by a collagenous stroma. The spindle cells have indistinct cell borders, scant to small amounts of acidophilic cytoplasm, and one elongated nucleus that contains one nucleolus and/or clumped chromatin. The cells exhibit moderate atypia and there are 9 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields. Scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells are located throughout the mass. A lymphoid nodule is located subjacent to the mass; the nodule is within normal limits. Blood vessels throughout the panniculus are multifocally cuffed low numbers of mononuclear inflammatory cells.""

  
**From second mass last week-** ""Differentials for this mass include fibrosarcoma or possible T cell rich B cell lymphosarcoma. In some nodules the spindle cell population is the dominant population and in other nodules the lymphocyte population is more prominent. Lymphocytic inflammation can be prominent in fibrosarcomas. The presence of a large number of heterogenous lymphocytes with B cells approximately 40% of the population as well as multinucleated giant cells was justification for including T cell rich B cell lymphosarcoma as a possible differential. However, this type of lymphosarcoma is rare in cats and reports in the literature describe the typical presentation as a single enlarged lymph node in the neck (which is not the case here).

Doggy Depression? Time for a Vet Visit? Just moody?,"For the last two months, my dog has been refusing to go outside into the yard. Luring him put doesn't work. Going with him doesn't work. He'll only go willingly if the other dog goes out first/is already out. Once he's out, he does his business, and immediately starts banging on the windows and doors with increasing hysteria, unless the other dog is out. If we go out with him and sit with him, he still goes straight to the door and won't acknowledge anyone until he's let inside. We've checked cameras and physically searched for any reason that he would be afraid of the yard all of a sudden, and found none. Previously, he loved being in the yard and would run and play by himself for hours. 

I recently went out of town without him for the first time, and the neighbors kept an eye on them for the 5 days I was gone. He spent most of his time in the yard, with the other dogs. I watched him on the camera repeatedly, and he was wandering around and sunbathing, and totally fine. 

Since I've gotten back, he's now completely refusing to get out of bed in the morning. Luring him doesn't work. Waiting for him to get up on his own time doesn't work. I'm having to physically drag him, and his bed, to the door and wrestle him outside to go to the bathroom. 

He's 2.5 years old, very lean, and I adopted him from the shelter at 8 weeks. He's a full-mutt, but is primarily a Mountain Cur/Great Pyreneese Mix. He's always been very intelligent and even-tempered, but something with him is just... off. He's showing no signs of being in pain, but has started pretending he's deaf anytime he's doing something he knows he's not supposed to, and has started incessantly doing things he's not supposed to. When I finally get his attention and tell him to knock it off, he acts like I've just told him that I hate him and he's the worst dog ever for the next 10 minutes. He's never been abused, hit, or even tapped, even before I adopted him (he was picked up at 2 weeks old and in an induced coma due to a severe infection until 2 hours before I adopted him). He's rarely ever even been yelled at. I've tried not forcing him to go outside and letting him tell me when he needs to go, but he held his bladder for 14 hours straight before I finally forced him out and he urinated for over a minute straight. 

So... is it vet time? Is he just lashing out and moody because I left him for 5 days? Sudden on-set separation anxiety? Obviously I know you all can't give me a definitive answer, but I'd love any advice. He's my first dog, and he's much more intelligent than any other dog I've ever met. I'm willing to chalk up his recent behavior to a tantrum over the fact that I left him, but the refusal to go to the bathroom was already pre-existing.",2024-04-12 20:37:21

Seeking advice: electric fence for outdoor cat,"Hi guys I’m new here so pls forgive me if this is a topic that’s been discussed frequently and I missed it… tried searching for posts about this but could find any that were more recent. 

A few years ago I rescued my cat from a parking lot in my hometown (the security guy actually stopped and told me that the cat was a stray and to take him home, I did not steal this cat just fyi), my cat was already 2-3 years old and raised in the wild so I didn’t try to make him a house cat because I thought it’d be cruel. I just bought a house and moved out of my parents house, but my new house is literally sitting right on a highway whereas my parents house was in a quiet suburban-type neighborhood where it wasn’t as much of a risk of him getting run over in the street. He is used to dodging cars at 20 mph in the neighborhood because of his childhood parking lot, but not like the 50 mph highway at my new house with more limited visibility. I’m scared to death of taking him home to my new house and waking up to him dead on the road. I’m in a moral conflict about compromising his “freedom” but have decided his safety is more important. I’m heavily considering this electric fence. I also am not really in the financial situation to spend $1500 for a professional install, but would make ends meet if that’s the route suggested over a diy $150-$300 project. Do y’all have any advice/thoughts/experiences that could help me out? Anything is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much in advance",2024-04-12 18:39:23

i live in a two story house and when i would stand on the back balcony and call for him, i could hear him crying for help, clearly unable to get out of wherever he was. he would respond with cries for about an hour. we have been searching for wherever he could be for 2 hours now– we have checked the roof, the attic, the entirety of the house multiple times, and the perimeters of the house multiple times. he is a VERY good boy. he always comes when we call him or at least responds if he is for some reason unable to come. the ONLY place i was able to hear him meowing/responding was while i was standing on the balcony underneath the roof/attic. there is absolutely nowhere on the balcony he could be and like i said, we have checked the attic and roof multiple times now. what do i do??? my entire family is looking for him. we CANNOT FIND HIM and he isn't responding anymore. please help!!! any help is appreciated 

update: we still have not found him but he began meowing back again this morning. currently we are searching for somewhere to get a thermal camera and i will get back to yall if that does it

update2: nothing so far with the thermal camera. it certainly works but we have aimed it at all walls, ceilings, floors, and everything in between. it is also rather hot out today so its picking up on way too many things in the attic. when night falls and it gets cooler out, we are going to use it again but that option has been exhausted as of right now i guess

EXTRA INFO: I am sorry for not including this earlier, my brain is just a huge mess rn. about my house: it is a relatively new house built on a steep hill. we are in california. there is no basement whatsoever, only attic. no septic system or open cisterns or pipes he would be able to get into from our house. all vents are sealed extremely tightly, four screws in place. same goes for any vents outside of the house. there are no open pipes or anything he could slip into under a sink. our ceilings are incredibly high and there are no tiles to it, it is solid. nothing on the roof has been moved, my father used a camera drone to look around on the roof, all vents and tiles are in place, he is not in any rain gutters or anything. our chimney is fake and doesn't actually go up, but there is a chimney section on the roof but it is covered with a thin mesh. it also does not go down to anything. there is essentially nowhere for him to go on the roof. there IS insulation and fluff covering the attic, i am worried he could be down in it somehow, but the thermal camera will not pick him up individually until it gets colder outside unfortunately. if he IS in the attic, it is not so hot he will be harmed, it is only 84F (i had this concern myself so i figured i would let you guys know this too). we have two entrances to the attic. we left one open and the other closed with my worn tshirt and his favorite blankey covered in silverine right on top of the entrance inside the attic. no such luck with that. i think as of right now he is sleeping somewhere; he is a good boy and comes when he is called, BUT he sleeps HARD. he is also not currently wearing a collar so that eliminates his collar getting caught on something luckily

i live in a two story house and when i would stand on the back balcony and call for him, i could hear him crying for help, clearly unable to get out of wherever he was. he would respond with cries for about an hour. we have been searching for wherever he could be for 2 hours now– we have checked the roof, the attic, the entirety of the house multiple times, and the perimeters of the house multiple times. he is a VERY good boy. he always comes when we call him or at least responds if he is for some reason unable to come. the ONLY place i was able to hear him meowing/responding was while i was standing on the balcony underneath the roof/attic. there is absolutely nowhere on the balcony he could be and like i said, we have checked the attic and roof multiple times now. what do i do??? my entire family is looking for him. we CANNOT FIND HIM and he isn't responding anymore. please help!!! any help is appreciated 

update: we still have not found him but he began meowing back again this morning. currently we are searching for somewhere to get a thermal camera and i will get back to yall if that does it

update2: nothing so far with the thermal camera. it certainly works but we have aimed it at all walls, ceilings, floors, and everything in between. it is also rather hot out today so its picking up on way too many things in the attic. when night falls and it gets cooler out, we are going to use it again but that option has been exhausted as of right now i guess

7 m/o puppy throwing up twice a day. Vets haven’t found anything. Looking for a second opinion!,"Hi!

As the title suggests, our 7 month old wire hair daschund is throwing up at least twice a day, a few hours after he eats for a number of weeks. His stools are fine. His energy and happiness are fine. 

The vets have done blood tests and an ultrasound and haven’t detected anything and he has switched to Royal Canine hypoallergenic puppy and this still hasn’t help. 

We’re not sure what to do next. The vets suggest an endoscopy but want to give it 8 weeks on this food. We’re minded to try other hypoallergenic or sensitive foods but would love suggestions. 

Please help, we’re quite worried about him! Thank you!",2024-04-12 15:32:55

Which pet should you get first if you want a dog and cat that get along?,"We got our dog when our cat was six years old. We thought getting the cat first was better because then the dog would accept that she was below the cat in the household hierarchy and bother him less. It sort of worked, but the cat detested the dog for at least a decade after we got her. 

Later I read somewhere that adult cats will probably always resent new puppies because they’re loud and annoying. Even after they grow up and calm down, the ill will remains.

So I thought maybe getting a dog and a cat at the same time might work better, but my friends did this and their cat and dog don’t love each other either.

Maybe it just depends on the individual animals, but I wonder if there’s a way of assembling the a little cat and dog family that maximizes the chances of success. Does anyone here have a dog and cat that really get along? Which one did you get first? ",2024-04-12 11:36:17

We thought getting the cat first was better because then the dog would accept that she was below the cat in the household hierarchy and bother him less. It sort of worked, but the cat detested the dog for at least a decade after we got her. 

Later I read somewhere that adult cats will probably always resent new puppies because they’re loud and annoying. Even after they grow up and calm down, the ill will remains.

So I thought maybe getting a dog and a cat at the same time might work better, but my friends did this and their cat and dog don’t love each other either.

Question about a dog for my family.,"My family had a beagle-corgi mix that lived to 19-20 (don't know exact age due to them being adopted at a random shelter in Mississippi) a few years back. We are considering getting another dog. However, our previous dog shedded fur everywhere and acted more like a cat.

I want to know if there's a dog that:

1. Doesn't shed or sheds minimally
2. Good and loving with little kids (since I don't want my 6 year old brother to get mauled)
3. Not very large, medium to small size.
4. Has a decent lifespan and good health",2024-04-12 09:31:51

My indoor cat has disappeared. It's been a week. I'm afraid she's going to die.,"I've looked everywhere, in the deepest dark of every closet, every drawer., every room. (Small house, 3 bedroom ranch)  I've left all the closet doors open incase she snuck in one.

I looked in the rafters, In the basement ceiling. Behind the refrigerator.  Under the kitchen counters.

She hasn't used the litter box, hasn't touched food or water. For a week.  I put out tuna, sardines, smelly stuff to draw her out.  nada

She's not ill, she's only 2 years old.

Normally she's a bossy cuddle bug and comes into my bed for treats  whenever I sit down.  (she demands treats, I should say) We have long cuddles and massages every morning and night.  She sleeps in my room on a high shelf I built her in front of a big window.

We had gone to have her nails trimmed the day before.  When we  came home she seemed fine.

But a couple days later I went to pick her up for some reason (I can't remember why) and she leapt out of my arms, and I haven't seen her since.

I could understand if she hid for a day or two, she must of thought I was going to put her in the carrier.  But I'm worried she is going to die.

She can't hide forever.

She has a bell on her collar and I haven't heard it at all.

(I adopted her as a rescue a year ago.  She was a stray, and injured, and the humane society nursed her and then I adopted her.  She was very skittish and shy and hid for a week when I brought her home, but I found her hiding spot and just set food and water up there, and eventually she came out.)

Has this ever happened to any of you and what did you do to find her?

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Thank you all so much. I'm loving all the great advice, and the stories of great returns and rescues. Its giving me hope. I just opened all the windows in the house. I opened the back door and was just started talking to her like I normally do, I saw a tail dash across the back yard. It might easily have been a squirrel, but maybe it was her! I didn't hear the bell, but I put water and a pile of dirty clothes on the back stoop. I'm going to get a humane trap tomorrow, but I'm thinking of leaving the back door open just in case she will wander in. If she hasnt made a sound, eaten or drank pooper or peed for a week, I'm guessing she's not inside. Is that a crazy idea? I'm in an incredibly safe place, I just might end up with a squirrel in the house. oh  well.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

OMG YOU ALL HAVE MY UNDYING GRATITUDE. THE WINDOWS ARE OPEN, AND I HEARD HER MEOW. I OPENED THE FRONT AND BACK DOOR, AND SHE JUST STREAKED THROUGH THE HOUSE!!!!!

Now I just have to shut the door behind her, but thank god she's alive, truly, thank you Lord.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Ok, she's streaking thru the house again, and mewling, like she wants me to give her attention, but she keeps running laps around the outside of the house, but she wont let me near her.

She thinks this is a game. I think I 'm just gonna sit in bed and play annoying cat noises until she comes in? both doors are open, lol. Its 50 degrees and rainy and windy. My neighbors really are going to think Im insane.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Ok, she's in the house, the doors are shut and locked, and she's sitting on my bed wanting treats, and I can't stop crying. Thank you all. For the record, I think opening the windows and playing the crying cats is what did it, becuase she started meowing like she had a batch of kittens for me to see (which she doesn't). That, and leaving the front and back door open for 4 hours ;) THANK YOU ALL, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I wouldn't have found her without you sharing you experience, strength and hope. I think you saved one life tonight, and maybe two. May god bless all you animal lovers, and your sneaky cats too. ;)

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

And its 4 am and she's meowing throughout the house, trying to find the band of lost kitten she thinks we have (from the ""get your cat to come to you"" YouTube video. lol

And I guess we are just going to stay up all night playing, snuggling, and eating treats.!  And thats fine with me.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

So I think she escaped when I took the trash out, the day after the nail visit, and she was hanging out in my neighbors storm drain, just enjoying the scenery and sadly probably feasting on baby rabbits (which are abundant in our yards)

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

She is glued to me today, never more than 5 feet away,  Honestly, we can't keep our hands off each other.  She seems physically intact, fine.  She's a little dirty and her collar looks like its been encountering the dirt a lot, lol.

She's not really eating her regular food yet, but she comes round every hour for one of those lickable treats of liquefied tuna/salmon/chicken like a popsicle.  I normally only give one at night and one in the morning, but I suspect it's the most palatable, digestible food she could eat, so I;m going all in on it, but spacing and pacing it so she doesn't eat too much.

She is exhausted, I will say that, and she's doing her daytime napping in my room, instead of off in various cozy other spots in the house.

Hey, do you guys know what the equivalent of chicken noodle soup for cats would be.  She is not digging into her food right now.  I know her first priority is rest, but I was just wondering if there is an easy to digest supplemental feed that is good for cats in high stress situations.  I am going to take her to the vet for a once over, and I'm sure she will recommend something, but the hive mind here is fantastic, so I thought I'd ask.

Thanks everyone.  Its been a rollercoaster.  I didnt realize how stressed and exhausted I was until today.  I feel like an emotional walking zombie.  It crazy that love for our fur babys can have such a hold over us.",2024-04-12 09:21:15

Underway with Cats?,I have two cats and I’m now in the coast guard and on a cutter; I only get underway for 3or 4 days at a time so I’m not really worried about leaving them alone. They’re used to short periods of being alone for travel and they’ve never been rowdy or misbehaved while I was gone in the past. I would like to get an automatic litter box though just to make them more comfy while I’m gone since I usually scoop their litter every day. I’m not SUPER concerned about price because they’re my babies lol but if I’m going to buy something pricey I want to know it works. Any advice or opinions on brands or what’s best in the situation? Also anyone else who travels a lot and has kitties that has input on other ways to entertain or take care of them is so so welcome 😊,2024-04-12 08:17:00

Any advice re: animal control? ,"I live in a fairly rural area in KY- all leash laws still apply. There is a property about a quarter mile away, through a wooded area and across a small road, who lets their dogs run wild. The 2 that frequent my yard are a golden doodle and a large Doberman. They are nice dogs, but VERY friendly to the point that they climb on you and will knock you over accidentally. If it were just me, fine. Problem is, I have a toddler who loves to play outside, and these dogs have come out of nowhere almost every time and startled her, knocking her over. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t check my mail without being trampled by dogs. They are constantly in my yard, on my porch, one even went in my garage as I unloaded groceries and I couldn’t get it out for a long time. 

I finally reached my limit when the dogs ruined our family Easter egg hunt, scaring the kids and trying to eat the candy filled eggs. I called animal control the the day after Easter, and again this morning, because it’s getting ridiculous. So far, they continue to run wild every day so I don’t know if AC has even gone out there. I know these dogs seem nice, but it’s scaring my toddler to the point that she cries when she sees them and I have to be on guard anytime we’re outside and ready to scoop her up. Side note, when my husband was small, he was mauled by a neighbors dog so I’m well aware that plenty of dogs can be friendly until they’re not. 

All that to say, am I being unreasonable wanting to be free from strange dogs on my own property? And if animal control doesn’t seem to be taking it seriously, what else can I do? I am not comfortable approaching the property owner myself. I am home alone with my child most of the time and it doesn’t seem like a safe solution. Any advice is appreciated.

Any advice re: animal control? ,"I live in a fairly rural area in KY- all leash laws still apply. There is a property about a quarter mile away, through a wooded area and across a small road, who lets their dogs run wild. The 2 that frequent my yard are a golden doodle and a large Doberman. They are nice dogs, but VERY friendly to the point that they climb on you and will knock you over accidentally. If it were just me, fine. Problem is, I have a toddler who loves to play outside, and these dogs have come out of nowhere almost every time and startled her, knocking her over. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t check my mail without being trampled by dogs. They are constantly in my yard, on my porch, one even went in my garage as I unloaded groceries and I couldn’t get it out for a long time.

I really want a cat but i’m scared i won’t be a good owner,"I’m a 15yo and since I was a kid I’ve always begged my mom for a kitty although she always said no. Finally after many years she changed her mind and is planning to take one home since a lady we know is giving away kittens. When she informed me of this the realization hit and I started to overthink everything. We live in a small apartment and I started thinking that the cat won’t have enough space, or about what we will do when we go on vacation,or about all the money they will need to spend (we’re not very wealthy).Or the fact that my life will have to change because the life of a living being will be my responsibility (change is something i’m utterly afraid of and I don’t know how to deal with it) And many more things I won’t mention. i’m just afraid I won’t be able to give the kitty the life it deserves and I don’t know if these feelings will pass when I’ll finally get attached or if I should wait to grow a little older to finally take in a kitten.Please help me if you’ve ever felt something remotely familiar!!",2024-04-12 06:46:45

Advice wanted ,"I live in a rural area. It’s common for people to let their dogs out and they roam free. I don’t subscribe to this method but it is what it is out here. For weeks, I’ve driven by a momma dog that just wanders around in the same area. I almost always see her out. Her breasts seem full with distended nipples like she’s possibly still feeding puppies but I’ve never seen any. She looks healthy-ish… as healthy as a nursing mom can look when they’re standing out in the rain. Healthy enough that she looks like she belongs to someone. 

I’m not sure what to do. I keep “threatening” to put her in the car and bring her home but I can’t financially take on another dog. I have two cat and two dogs now. Keeping up with flea treatment alone is crazy expensive, vet bills, another mouth to feed etc… 

I don’t like the idea of sending her to a shelter because what if she belongs to someone? 

I’d like to knock around some ideas on how to proceed. I’m not sure I can deny her big brown eyes too many more times. She’s breaking my heart. ",2024-04-12 04:58:59

ways to handle my pet anxiety?,"apologies if this isn't the right sub, but I can't find a lot of info on this and thought it was worth a shot <3 thank you

I have an almost three year old cat who is the love of my life and truly my best friend- he is the sweetest boy and always so full of affection, constantly around me when I'm home unless he's sleeping. I also have a lot of stress in my life right now, as I'm currently in the process of graduating from college, starting grad school, finding a decent job, and working through some health issues.

I've noticed that whenever I get extremely stressed out, the stress presents itself in me suddenly being extremely anxious about my cat and his health or wellbeing, with lots of spiraling about things that could go wrong that I feel like could be considered intrusive thoughts. sometimes I don't even know I'm \*that\* stressed until I start having heightened anxiety (sometimes even panic attacks) about my cat. I know this isn't just a me thing because I've done some research, but does anyone have tips or ideas of ways to alleviate this? I usually don't realize I'm on my way towards extreme-stress-turned-panic-about-my-cat until it's already happening.

I would love some sort of like fidget toy or tiny plushie or just some small trinket that reminds me of him that I could carry in my bag and hold if this ever happens, but can't think of anything aside from just carrying a toy with me. I just want some way to ""keep him with me"" while I'm not home and I get anxious. 

TL;DR -- I get bad pet anxiety over my cat whenever I'm too stressed out and I want to handle it, if anyone has advice or ideas on something small I could carry with me to ground me.",2024-04-12 04:40:29

Are bunnies good pets? 🐰,"My young daughter and I desperately want a cat, but unfortunately my husband is extremely allergic. I’ve been researching alternatives and thought a rabbit could be a good fit for our family. Something cute and fluffy and less work than a dog. However, whenever I bring up the idea to others, they all say “Oh, rabbits are terrible pets! Don’t get one! They stink and poop and pee everywhere!” 

I don’t know. The internet makes them out to be sweet pets but obviously the people in my life aren’t into them. We don’t have any other pets currently. 

Update! Thank you all for your thoughtful feedback. I hear you loud and clear 🙏

At this time, we’ve decided not to move forward with adopting a bunny. Main reasoning is we that don’t have the space and time for *two* bunnies and not just one. Several people also mentioned that rabbits can be more demanding than dogs, which was eye opening. The main challenge with dogs are the puppy years, which is where my brain was at when writing the post. I’ve raised a pup once and it was a lot!

Anyway, I have a demanding job and a five year old daughter, so I have enough on my plate at the moment 😊 

To clarify, I have done a decent amount of preliminary research and understand the basic responsibilities of owning a rabbit. I did not put that in the OG post because I was trying to keep that as short and snappy as possible because TLDR.

Please know I have the best intentions and wherewithal of being a responsible pet owner. Of course the bunny would be spayed / neutered, have ample space and exercise, all the various foods and chew things, etc etc. I live in an area with several specialty vets, and I have the cash to pay 💰 What I don’t have, unfortunately, is space for two rabbits ☹️

Hoppfully, someday I’ll be able to revisit the possibility of bunny ownership 🐰 For now, I’m waiting on the cat vaccine (Hypocat) that can lower a cat’s allergy effect!

Puppy broken femur - surgery or amputation?,"Hi,

Looking for some opinions and/or support on how I should handle this tough situation.

I purchased a puppy from a breeder in January. The puppy had a slight limp that we noticed when we brought him home at 11 weeks of age. At his first vet checkup that first week, they noted some weakness/lameness in his back right knee but said they weren't too worried about it and as his leg grew, it should strengthen.

Fast forward to March, and he still doesn't like using that leg. Vet took some XRays and it appears that his femur is broken. Based on videos and photos we have from the first couple days with the puppy, it's clear that his femur was broken when we got him. The breeder has agreed to refund our purchase.

We're now stuck with the decision of if we should try and fix his leg, or if we should amputate the leg. The surgery cost to try and fix the leg is more than double what the cost of the dog was and our vet has made clear that the surgery isn't guaranteed to ""take"" long term, and in that event, we would need to amputate his leg anyway.

I'm heartbroken about this situation, and feeling a lot of anguish and rage toward the breeder for putting us in this scenario. Could use any wisdom or tidbits of advice here about what i should do. At this point, Emmett has had a borken femur for the majority of his life.",2024-04-12 02:20:38

Just had kittens! But losing my dad now. What's to do?,"On April 8, our cats gave birth to her 6 kittens. 
For the three weeks before that, I was in another state caring for my elderly dad (83), helping Mom (81) and frankly, expecting to bury Dad while there. 
I returned once Dad was settled in rehab and it looked like it was just a matter of  a couple of weeks to get him walking again.  His motivation & spirits were very high. 

Last night rehab sent him to the ER because his breathing was too shallow, O2 levels far too low. 
Cardiomegaly was diagnosed, blood clots in the lungs, he was put on a ventilator (he had one weeks before due to bronchitis and pneumonia ) 
He's not responding to prompts like he did before; ""Dad, squeeze my hand"" ""do you feel me touching your foot""... 

Since he and I shared many long hours and some long talks, I don't feel the need to get there unless we know it's time for his life to end. I will fly. 

Driving out will be my husband and 4 or 5 of our granddaughters. We are raising 4 of them. The fifth lives near-ish with her dad. 
They will need two days to get to our home state. 

Meanwhile, we have Mama cat and her kittens. 
I don't imagine they can go in the van with everyone. Or can they?
We live in a very rural area so having someone drop in to check on them is asking a lot. That leaves us with taking them to another home for friends to watch over them. 

What do I arrange?! I'm truly at a loss. 
Thanks for any help you can give me.

Just had kittens! But losing my dad now. What's to do?,"On April 8, our cats gave birth to her 6 kittens. 
For the three weeks before that, I was in another state caring for my elderly dad (83), helping Mom (81) and frankly, expecting to bury Dad while there. 
I returned once Dad was settled in rehab and it looked like it was just a matter of  a couple of weeks to get him walking again.  His motivation & spirits were very high. 

Last night rehab sent him to the ER because his breathing was too shallow, O2 levels far too low. 
Cardiomegaly was diagnosed, blood clots in the lungs, he was put on a ventilator (he had one weeks before due to bronchitis and pneumonia )

Pet Insurance Question,"I have a question about how pet insurance works. I am thinking of getting it for my 6 year old shih tzu mix dog.

Cat keeps pooping outside of litter box — want to train to use auto litter box,"Hi — I wanted to get some advise about my cat pooping outside of the litter box. For a bit of background, I have two cats: the first one is about three years old and is very anxious, the second one is 11 months and is like a small puppy (very confident). As for the litter boxes, we have one of the Casa Leo’s auto litter boxes and one normal litter box. We have had the auto litter box for several months and our kitten has no issues using it, but our older cat won’t use it, at least not consistently.

I have tried letting them use the normal litter box for several months to acclimate, and then removing it so theoretically they would just use the Leo’s box, but the older cat wouldn’t stop pooping on the floor. And even now, when the normal box gets full (sometimes I don’t clean as a way to tempt her to use the auto box), the older cat still poops on the floor. 

My girlfriend and I love to travel, and obviously don’t want to come home to poop all over our home. We are at a loss of what to do. Any help would be much appreciated — thank you!

Newborn Puppy Advice,"Hello all. I've come to find myself caring for a newborn puppy. I went to a friend's house to give her a ride to work, and heard something making a tiny tiny squeaky noise(she said she had heard it from yesterday afternoon but didn't know what it was.) Anyways, I looked around the yard and found a tiny puppy, couldn't be more than a few days old, hiding next to a pile of sticks and trash. We thought it may had been the neighbors so asked if they were missing a puppy, but was told there dog doesn't have puppies, asked several other neighbors as well. I made sure to search for anymore puppies before leaving. I was just wondering if anyone had any advice. So far what I'm doing is..

- Feeding puppy formula around every two hours or on demand as she wants it
-Stimulating her to go to the bathroom after each feeding
- Making sure she stays warm
-Massigung her to mimic a nother cleaning(don't know if that helps but read it online)

Is there anything else I need to be aware of to do for her? Also when found she had little yellow things all over her and on her skin(I'm assuming some kind of eggs from an insect) I was able to get most of the ones in her fur off but some are still stuck to her skin,  is it okay to bathe her this young to try to remove them or is there another way I should try? She was very lethargic when I found her, but now she's gotten more active and crawling around when she gets hungry or trying to get comfortable. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I REALLY want her to make it. Her name is Chilli. Thanks for any advice! ",2024-04-11 20:55:32

Rescue kitten - flea and worm questions,"Just got a 6-month old male cat from the Humane Society. He was rescued from an abuse/neglect situation and arrived at the shelter with fleas, among other things.

At the shelter, he was given Frontline Gold and Pyrantel Pamoate. He was neutered that same day, and two days later we took him home. 

We used a fine comb to groom him and definitely saw a dozen or so little black spots. There were fewer and fewer over the course of the next week, but then this morning when we groomed him it seemed like there were a lot again. 

My understanding is that with the flea treatment, as long as he is placed in a flea-free environment, there shouldn’t be any risk of re-infection by dormant fleas. Is there a chance he brought some fleas home with him? Or that the medication wasn’t completely effective? I know we can give another dose in about 2 weeks, and we were also going to do a flea bath today (waited because of the neutering). Is there anything else we can do?

Also, there have been no signs of tapeworm and he was given the Pyrantel Pamoate for other worms. The vet mentioned we could do prophylactic tapeworm treatment because of the flea exposure. Is this generally recommended too?

Would really appreciate anyone’s input. Just want to do right by our new pet and give him a safe home.",2024-04-11 20:02:51

I washed it immediately and put on some betadine.

An hour after, I brought him to the nearest ABC (Animal Bite Center) to get his 4 shots. (Anti Rabies and ERIG)

Looking for advice on a fundraiser,"I'll begin with saying I'm not looking for donations, I'm looking for advice. 

There's a charity where I live that take care of homeless cats and especially special needs ones that nobody else will take in. It was through them that both of my cats were able to get the medical care they needed to survive. They also try to place those cats with people who are elderly/disabled and help with the expenses the cats come with so they get the benefits of a good home.

So I'm wondering what sort of things I can say that will get people's attention and hopefully their donations? Like if there's anything that would make one of you give or that you've seen in successful fundraisers. 

Right now I can talk about the organization, talk about my younger cat who's life was saved by them, talk about my older cat who literally saved my life and they make sure she has the pain medicine she needs to be able to get me help when I need it, or I can try to get pictures and a story about one or more of the homeless ones they are trying to place. Oh and I can offer digital pet paintings for anyone who gives over a certain amount, I'll have to figure out how much.

I'll say again, I'm not trying to get donations I want advice! If it's still not allowed go ahead and take this down but I'm really hoping someone can help me do this. I'm not able to help them any other way besides setting up fundraisers but I want to do what I can.",2024-04-11 16:01:40

"Old dog with seizures, is it inhumane to not take to vet?","Just a little information on this, my parents (who I live with) have a 16year old pomeranian who had 3 seizures in 2 days a few weeks ago, then nothing, then 2 seizures in a day this week (no history of seizures prior). They aren't taking her to a vet because they say shes old and not worth the money to get it checked out and they plan to most likely just let her keep having them until she dies. It just sounds a little inhumane to me I guess, is this normal among people who have old dogs who know their most likely near the end of their life anyway to not bother with vets?",2024-04-11 15:54:05

will i be euthanizing my cat too soon?,"I have a 15 year old cat and she was open mouth breathing. brought her in 3 days ago to the emergency vet, where they removed fluid from her lungs and ran tests to see what the cause was. she got diagnosed with lung cancer.

they let her out of hospitalization since her breathing was back to normal after the fluid removal. they said the only curative solution was surgery.

i dont think i will be pursuing surgery, since she’s old and has a higher thyroid level. i dont want her last moments to potentially be in such a scary environment or spend the rest of her life in recovery and pain.

i went to two different vets, and they both said i could consider at home euthanasia since the fluid will come back. I have my cat on steroids right now to help with the pain.

I’m scared since her breathing today got a little heavier than yesterday, but everything else about her is normal. she’s eating, using the litterbox, purring and cuddling with me, overall relatively comfortable. I can’t seem to wrap my head around how this can all be real. I feel like i would be letting go too early right now because what if the fluid comes back slower and she has more time to be comfortable? But i also don’t want to wait to see her in pain to make the decision because her last moments will be in pain. I really don’t know what to do :(",2024-04-11 14:02:32

Is this animal abuse?,"My bf of ~1 year and I recently moved in together, and he floated the idea of getting a dog. However, he recently told me about the dog he and his dad used to have when he was a teenager living in a small apartment in a big city in the northern US, where it gets really cold. He loved his dog a lot, but he told me that he and his dad used to chain up the dog outside at night instead of letting it stay in the apartment with them. It was a small apartment (they were a single parent, low income family) and so they were apparently concerned about space and cleanliness, according to my bf. He said that they often had to deal with accusations of animal neglect/abuse from people in the neighborhood, but the way he told the story, it seemed like he thought these accusations were totally baseless and even classist. 

I’ve been a dog lover/owner for my entire life, and I personally would never, ever, leave my dog outside chained up in the cold. I feel pretty uncomfortable with the idea of getting a dog with someone whose idea of love and care seems so drastically different from mine. Nevertheless, I grew up with a comparatively privileged background, where we had a bigger house and a backyard for the dogs to play in. Ive never had to deal with pet ownership in a big city, so i don’t know if im being unfair. We live in a smaller city now, with more space, but I cant shake my feelings of concern.

Am I overreacting? Is this treatment toward dogs ok in the city? Should I get a dog with him?  

EDIT: Thanks guys, you’ve all kinda validated what I’ve been thinking. Consensus is that this is definitely not ok (especially considering the breed and circumstances which I chose not to disclose). I have strong reason to believe the bf was also a victim in this household, so im gonna start by having a conversation with him about why this is animal abuse, and hopefully he can begin to unpack the things he was told by his dad as a kid. Definitely for now, getting a dog is off the table. ",2024-04-11 12:43:46

I need help with my cat,"It’s been about 2 days since my cat has stopped entering my room and I’m just confused and concerned at this point, I’ve had my cat for about 7 years, my room is his room, what I mean by that is his litterbox is in my room, so is his food station and his toys, all of a sudden my cat has stopped going into my room, he will just sit near the bathroom door in the hallway and stare at my room, I tried bringing him to my bed the second day I noticed this but he was too scared to get down, he just kept hovering at the edge of my bed, I took him out after seeing that he was scared and about a few hours later put a treat into his bowl to see if he would be more comfortable with being in my room, he hasn’t touched the treat at all and I don’t think he has been eating or drinking, I haven’t seen him use his litter box at all, I think it is due to this rug I just got, but I’m confused on why it’s such an issue considering he was playing around on it and laying there not too long ago, I found a popped balloon in here earlier so me and my dad are thinking that the noise has scared him and he is associating the rug with the noise since he actively avoids the rug, he has no issues with me and is just as active and cuddly as before, just won’t come into my room, what can I do to rebuild my trust with him and get him to come back into my room? I’m thinking of moving his food station to the living room for now until I can find out what is causing this and how I can fix this and make my cat feel more safe 

We brought the rug out thinking it would help but it hasn’t helped at all and I am very concerned, I brought him in here to use the restroom because he hasn’t been able to and he ended up peeing on the floor after stepping off the litter-box, I think he peed himself because he was scared and he was holding it in for so long, genuinely don’t know what to do, if anybody knows something at all please let me know",2024-04-11 11:54:28

Pet Insurance Pre Existing Conditions,"Hi — my cat has to get an echocardiogram for a heart gallop. At this time, they have no idea what is causing it.

If he gets diagnosed with a disease following the echocardiogram, would treatment for the disease be covered? I know I’m out of luck for the echo expenses. I have Fetch. Right now he doesn’t have any diagnosis, the only thing on his record is “heart gallop.” If he were to be diagnosed with a lifelong heart disease, would medication for that be covered or would it be a pre existing condition?

Any thoughts + experiences welcome. Regardless I’m keeping the pet insurance for my cats (learning my lesson the hard way) but I wanted to get opinions.

how to find out who poisoned my dog (I put NSFW because I don't know if the topic may hurt susceptibilities).,"Today in the morning they poisoned my dog, a xoloitzcuintle about a year old, I was not there because I am in college and it happened in my home town, from what they told me, the dog escaped when my dad returned from leaving my younger brother in his high school, he ran as soon as he saw the door open and as they could not catch him, they let him roam the streets for a while, but he came back poisoned about after an hour, Unfortunately, although they took him to the vet as soon as they saw him, he did not survive because he was a puppy and that variety of xoloitzcuintle is small, it had already happened to us with a cat, but since that cat was always very surly and was never at home, we already knew that at some point that would happen, I already have an idea of where it may happened, because that cat was found by our neighbor whose house borders the marginal zone of our neighborhood (it is an area next to the cane fields where families of 7 live in two-room houses, so you can imagine the kind of people who live there) and bc of the fact my dog started to run towards that area, I suspect it even more, because the animal poisoning started at the same time that the people of that area started throwing used diapers to the houses of the other neighbors, so I suspect that it could be the same person or someone from there, I know that the laws against animal abuse are shit in our country, but something must be tried.

Is Rehoming Best for my Newly Adopted Dog?,"Hi,

I adopted an older shih tzu mix dog from the south about three weeks ago. (I live in a NE state). I love this little guy so much and have been bonding with him very well. He's like my little baby.

My worry is that I have an almost 3-year-old son. My son has been great with our dog (gentle and gives him space), but my dog seems VERY anxious around him (my son is loud and runs around as he's still young). I purposely asked the rescue I adopted him from if he would be comfortable with a young toddler and they said that he was living in a family of ten and is comfortable around young kids. 

Our dog has been super great with my son, but our dog is also licking his paws (already went to vet about allergies and he doesn't have any) and it seems to occur only when our dog is free range of the house or around my son. He has access to my bedroom where he can go for calm/quiet time. He also does the full body shake, licks his lips, and yawns and he just started chewing on things (bought him a bunch of chew toys to redirect). He is easily startled and will jump and get scared over something dropping or making a loud sound.  He doesn't do many of these anxious behaviors when it's just me with him and he goes for a 45 min walk and does short sprints with me to release some of his energy and help with stress. 

I know he's still settling in, but I'm worried that maybe we're not the right fit for our dog and maybe I should find a calm and quiet family so he isn't so stressed. I don't want to as it would break my heart, but I want to make the right choice for him. What are your thoughts or suggestions? ",2024-04-11 07:57:33

ManyPets Preexisting Condition,"Hiya! We have ManyPets for our three pets, which we got for each of them the day that we adopted them, specifically to avoid racking up uncovered preexisting conditions at our early vet visits with them. We’ve recently been worried about our dog having a specific condition, so took a closer look at our coverage (which we admittedly should have done years ago) prior to seeking treatment. We noticed that the definition of “Preexisting Condition” is any condition that was noted/treated/etc. in the 18 months prior to the “Policy Effective Date,” and that “Policy Effective Date” seems to be the annual date that the policy renews, rather than the date that coverage began several years ago. So, this indicates to me that, even though our dog was covered by ManyPets last year, if an issue she had last year recurs this year, it will be an uncovered preexisting condition. I would have thought that, if the issue occurred for the first time when she was covered, it would not be a preexisting condition. Has anyone had an experience with ManyPets that confirms that conditions that first occur while the pet is covered are preexisting if they recur after the policy’s annual renewal?",2024-04-11 07:14:22

How to calm my dog down whilst my husband is in hospital?,"My husband is currently in hospital with Pneumonia (he’s going to be okay with treatment). We have two pets, a Golden Retriever (6M) named Buddy and a cat called Maeve (3F). Before my husband went into hospital today, Buddy was crying and cuddled up to my husband on the couch, seemingly knowing he was ill. My dad has been looking after the pets today and told me that Buddy has been crying and howling all day. Dad thinks he is looking for my husband. Buddy doesn’t usually cry like this, although he always wait by door for us to get home. I think he knows this is different from us going to work. He also usually has one of us at home due to working days/nights respectively. Anyone got any tips for calming Buddy down? My dad has been petting him but it hasn’t helped and he doesn’t want to play or go for walks, which is out of character.  

For anyone wondering about the cat…Maeve couldn’t care less about her daddy being gone apparently. She has been sleeping upstairs most of the time and has meowed for some food/ treats. Typical lol.

Travelling to UK with pets advice,"My wife and I recently managed to get her a spouse visa to come and live with me in the UK. We are trying to work out the best way to transport her 2 young cats from her home in south america.

My wife is strongly against transporting the cats in cargo, and so we have been looking into other ways to get them here.

Our main options are:
1) Travel to France then get the train to Calais and then the ferry (we don't have a driving license)
2) hire a pet taxi service to take us into the UK
3) (the one she doesn't want) Travel straight to the UK with the pets in the hold (from Brazil this would be almost a 12h journey)
4) hire a pet transport company to take them to the UK (which would be over double the cost of any of the above options).

Any advice on which option would be best / any other ideas would be massively appreciated!!
Also if anyone has any stories or advice we would love to hear it!",2024-04-11 06:07:44

Cat Adoption Remorse or actual mistake?,"I adopted a cat on Saturday (wow okay it hasn't been as long as it felt like it's been) and I'm really questioning my decision.

He's a gem. Like a great little guy who's friendly and loves to cuddle and just wants to hang out. He's not the problem at all. In fact, he's like a perfect little cat, espec since he's only 1 like I know he'll mellow out too and hasn't been destructive. I don't think I could have found a better cat. Which is why like... I keep feeling like I should be more in love with him already and wanting to spend more time with him. And I just keep wondering if he could have a better home.

I have a little Scottish terrier who I love so so much. Like she has my whole heart and has since the day I took her home. And I had two dogs then so like it's not an issue of having multiple pets (for me at least). She did get jealous of my other dog at times so I figured I would try a cat. That said... I've never been much of a cat person. I mean I found a cat that is pretty much like a dog tbh. I also have allergies to cats. I thought like I could get air purifiers and take meds and maybe be okay but like it's still a little miserable for me. Like I get sinus pressure after spending a half hour with him.

Also my dog is pretty terrified of the cat. I know that's something that I can work on but she was a rescue and I've worked for over a year trying to build her confidence up overall and I'm worried this may set her back.

I know it's only been a few days but like... I keep just wanting to hang out with my dog and feeling guilty about not wanting to spend as much time with my cat. Even though like when I have he's been a good boy. I don't know I can't tell if this is just adopter's remorse/panic or like if I actually made a mistake.  Like I'm not sure if I'm just terrified of trying to make things work and how hard it might be or like if this is something I actually just don't want. 

Thankfully he's on a foster-to-adopt program with me so if I have 30 days to decide which it is. But idk I just wanted some advice and gut feelings on the situation.",2024-04-11 05:48:57

How can we deal with that cat?,"Me and wife have had a huge problem lately, next doors cat keeps making these extremely loud meows wanting to come in through the back door of its house. The owner works 9 hours a day and if we are both home we have to put up with it. At night the cat will go out and when it wants to come in it just sits by the back door of its house constantly meowing and we have to be up at 0500 in the morning for work. 
Half the time when we have gone round to complain there has been no answer and when the owner does answer she claims she can’t do anything about it. She has cat flap and apparently not her fault if it does not use it. 

This has been happening every day and every night for far too long now and it’s not just me and my wife that are getting pissed off . The neighbour the other side has been shouting out the window and last night he went out with a metal pot and smashed a spoon or whatever it was on it repeatedly to shut it up. 5 mins later it does it again. Today we have complained to the council about it ",2024-04-11 05:40:39

The neighbour the other side has been shouting out the window and last night he went out with a metal pot and smashed a spoon or whatever it was on it repeatedly to shut it up. 5 mins later it does it again. Today we have complained to the council about it ",2024-04-11 05:40:39
Cat fighting other cat after grooming,"
I have 3 cats, one female and two males. The one male has always been more aggressive but never anything terrible. I took the non aggressive male cat to get shaved and they gave him a bath so he smelled different. As soon as he came home, the other male went after him and attacked him. We separated them for the day and then introduced them again and he went after the other cat again. He is very aggressive and it seems like he wants to kill the other cat. The other cat is not aggressive at all so he just tries to get away. We are keeping them separated for now, but I don’t know what to do. 

This has never happened before. He doesn’t bother the female cat and will sniff the male cat but as soon as the male shows any sign of fear he goes after him. I am assuming he didn’t like the smell at first but now it seems like he just all of a sudden hates the cat and isn’t going to change",2024-04-11 05:30:05

I'm too attached to my dog and it's worrying me,"I got my dog, Peanut, in August of 2022. He is a Shih tzu Maltese, and will be two years old this May.

When we adopted him from the pet center, he was not my first choice. I wanted the corgi, but after me and my boyfriend stepped out to discuss adopting him, someone bought him. The store owner then pointed out the two brothers, and said that we could visit with them, and that ""everything happens for a reason"". 

""Sure"" I thought. I wanted the corgi but ok I guess. One of the brothers was barking, and the other was quiet, sitting behind the brother in the corner. I asked her if we could visit with the quieter one. She brought him out and he was shy, and let me cuddle him on my chest. After a couple minutes, his spunky playful energy came out and he was acting goofy and starting to trust us. That is when we knew we were going to adopt him. 

Fast forward to now. He is literally, LITERALLY, my entire world. He is the sweetest angel. He has a playful personality, and does hilarious things all the time, like when he play-chomps on my hand and pretends to bite me. He follows me everywhere and refuses to let anyone else take him on a walk if I am not there. He always wants to be next to me. 

I am gone for work 10 hours a day (my boyfriend has a flexible schedule and is home from work at 10am), so when I get back he is SO excited to see me. My boyfriend said he just sleeps most of the day and waits for me to get home. :( 

I have become so attached to him, especially being diagnosed with OCD and anxiety, he has been the biggest blessing from God to me. I am scared that I now love him so much that something bad will happen and he will die and be taken away from me. I cannot imagine my life without him. 

My dad (horrible relationship with him) felt the need to remind me when he saw how happy I was with him that dogs do not go to heaven and I won't see him again after he dies. He says things like that that just sting, even if it's true. Can anyone relate?",2024-04-11 01:22:59

Flea battle.,"Fighting Fleas in a Pet-Free Apartment: My Frustrating Journey

Moving into a ground floor apartment, without any pets. Seemed like a dream until the unwelcome guests – fleas – made their presence known about three weeks after settling in. Initially, I brushed off the issue, assuming fleas couldn't survive long without a furry host. Armed with a knockoff flea spray, I waged war against these persistent pests, only to find them resurfacing time and again despite my efforts.

Determined to eradicate the infestation, I dove into forums and articles, adopting every suggested tactic with fervor. From meticulous vacuuming and laundering to investing in a handheld vacuum for precision, so I can vacuum sofa and mattress as well. Yet, with each round of cleaning and spraying, the fleas proved relentless, appearing as soon as I thought victory was near.

Desperate for a solution, I called professional pest control, opting for the more costly service in hopes of finally banishing the pests. However, even they were astounded by the persistent flea population lingering in my pet-free abode after two thorough exterminations.

Now, plagued by questions and doubts, I wonder: can fleas emerge from their pupae months after treatment? How long do they typically linger in a pet-free environment post-extermination? Should I alert my landlord, admitting my struggle with this unseen enemy?

As a first-time renter, navigating this ordeal has been overwhelming. Could the issue extend beyond my unit, implicating the building itself? Or it’s possible that the problem was in the apartment/building itself before I moved in? What crucial step am I missing or what am I doing wrong in this battle against the fleas?

In search of answers and a definitive solution, I'm left grappling with the persistence of these tiny foes and the uncertainty of whether peace will ever be restored.",2024-04-11 01:06:33

Are pet monkeys being abused on social media platforms by creators?,"I see a lot of tiktok videos about monkeys being kept as pets, and it seems weird and unnatural for them to be treated as pets. They just aren't domestic animals like cats or dogs. 

I see monkeys wearing diapers. Are those even comfortable for them?

More importantly, are these monkeys being caged? Monkeys cannot be tamed, and I doubt any monkey owner wants to babysit a monkey all day long. I would assume they must be caging the monkeys to avoid damage/messes to their living areas. ",2024-04-11 00:38:36

Introducing cats to a dog?,"Hello! 

My boyfriend and I are moving into a house in about a month and I have 2 cats and he has one dog- a very friendly husky. His dog has met cats before and she was curious and just sniffed them but wasn't aggressive etc. One of my cats is friendly and not afraid of many things or people but my other cat I adopted during COVID and he wasn't around people aside from me and he is timid. Neither of my cats have met or seen a dog before and they are both almost 4 years old. 

I am hoping to get some tips on how to introduce them since they will be living under the same roof and I would love for them to get along eventually.

How do I stop my dog peeing on walls ,"Hi there - just looking for advice or if anyone has had similar experiences. 

I have a 4 year old male toy poodle- he is very active, affectionate and has always been anxious. Potty training him has always been incredibly difficult - I could not trust him to go outside 100% of the time, unless I followed him each time. About two years ago he started peeing on walls, I thought it was a boredom thing, however even if I take him on three walks a day he would still pee on the walls. I also considered it to be territorial, however we have one female dog who has been around since he was 6 months old, and no other dogs come around, so I’m not sure why he would be territorial. He also gets so much affection, attention, and mostly has someone around so he isn’t lonely. He loves to play fetch constantly. 

I’m just looking to understand why he could be doing this, and if there is any advice to train him to understand that this is not okay. I have engaged multiple trainers for other behavioural issues (he is a lockdown dog) which he has massively improved in, and it’s important to note he is a negative reinforcement dog.

I just can’t crack the code on this, and would love to not find pee on my walls constantly. Any help is appreciated ",2024-04-11 00:12:50

Every morning, when the sun is just beginning to peek over the horizon, I go for a walk with Max. He frolics through the field, chasing butterflies and jumping over tall grasses. Sometimes, he stops to sniff a flower or to listen to a bird's song. Those moments are magical, seeing Max explore the world with such curiosity and joy fills me with happiness. At the end of the day, when the sun sets and the field is filled with shadows, Max and I return home. He curls up at my feet, tired but content after a day full of adventures.

Dying cat,Hey guys me and my dad figured out my cat randomly went blind last night her eyes went massive and she started to breathe weird . I tried to spend some time with her but she didn’t even know where I was and was walking into furniture. When I woke up this morning she wouldn’t even come to me she’s curled up in the corner with her face to the wall breathing so softly she won’t even look at me when I call her or pet her on the head. Sometimes her tail moves a little and I can see her breathing but that’s it. Should I just leave her there and let her rest in peace? I feel like there’s not much more I can do at this point sadly :(,2024-04-10 22:44:50

Getting a puppy with 2 hybrid cats,"I'm about to purchase a Samoyed pup and I'm worried how my two hybrid cats are going to react. One is a 3 year old Bengal and the other is a 2 year old Savannah. They have been together since the Savannah was a kitten and tolerate each other quite well.  The Bengal is aloof and not really friendly to other animals and the Savannah is just a big softy who isn't afraid of anything..

I've been in regular contact with the Samoyed breeder and the pups have been brought up around 4 cats. 

Just looking for people's experiences and advice on the matter, as I know Hybrids can be quite different. ",2024-04-10 22:33:51

A pet tree for a cat and dog. ,"Is there one out there I’ve searched the whole internet I have a small dog and a cat and I want them to not have a cool area to chill together. Is there a product out there like this. I’ve searched Amazon YouTube and just basic Google I keep seeing cat trees but nothing suited for both animals. 

If there’s anyone here who’s owned both for a long period of time and or has found one  please let me know because In a minute I’ll just do it myself.

Tips for training my dog to be out unattended?,"Hey guys! I have two dogs, and the larger of the two is not able to be out of his kennel unattended. I recently lost my main job, and am home a lot more(only work 4h a day at my side hustle while I find something else) so I’ve been trying to work on this with him. For the last week, I’ve been sleeping on the couch and letting him stay out at night because I feel guilty for how much time he spends in his crate. I don’t keep him crated 24/7 by any means, but when I have to work he’s put up 8 hours, gets out until bedtime, and then has to go back up over night. My other dog also has to stay crated (even though she’s fine in the house alone) because he cries and whines until he throws up if he’s in the room alone in his crate. He goes in the kennel willingly, and as long as his buddy is in the room (in or out of the crate) he is ok. 

The first night, he got into some stuff, and made a pretty big mess. That was on me because I left stuff out. The second night, he tore up a couple things but not as bad as the first day. Since then, he’s been good as gold, and I think it’s because some of the novelty of being out and having full access to the house has worn off. 

Today, though, is the big day. I plan to leave him out alone with my other dog while I go to work. Do you guys have any tips, tricks, or life hacks to make this process easier? I’m really anxious about leaving him with access, even though he’s really good. He’s only 2.5, and he’s been with me a year. 

If you wonder why I’ve waited so long to do this, it’s taken this long to fully potty train him and stop the marking behaviors that he learned before I got him. He was an outside dog and is extremely headstrong. It only took 2 weeks to potty train him, but he would mark constantly in the house. He stopped doing that around 2 months ago, and is consistently and exclusively going potty outside  Now that those are corrected and he’s gotten used to just chilling, I want to teach him how to be out and have free reign without causing damage to my things. 

I plan to dog proof the house before I leave today, give him an extra long walk, and stuff his kong or make a frozen lick mat for him to keep him occupied. ",2024-04-10 22:10:55

Looking for world's strongest cat door to contain escape artist,"We have a cat door to let our cat out into the yard while we're home/awake, which just isn't keeping the little bugger contained. I need to replace it or remove it, and as it's Melbourne, it's about to get real cold and I'd rather not remove it as I don't want to have to keep the door open so he can go out. Rain, hail, chill, or shine, he will fight for his freedom loudly, annoyingly, and against council regulations.

The cat door we have is cheap and he has broken through the lock, brute forced through the wooden door I put on it, and will not be contained. I need a door that can withstand projectiles. A door that the most dedicated grey and white jerk can't break through. 

Any tips or doors would be greatly appreciated!

My dog has swollen lymph nodes - is it cancer?,So basically I have a Patterdale Terrier that is 12 years old - not that old for a Patterdale really. About a month ago I noticed the lymph nodes in his neck were swollen and his other lymph nodes also became swollen. Obviously online everywhere it says it may be lymphoma but he’s mostly been completely normal and is still exactly the same with no problems eating or anything. My parents don’t want to take him to the vets because they don’t want it to be a reality if he is ill and they’d rather just not know.,2024-04-10 21:26:36

How can I improve my elderly dog’s life ,"I had 2 dogs. They were best friends. A year ago, one passed away, leaving the other. She’s 10, so not terribly old. 

Anyway, she sticks to me like glue all day. I have a beautiful big garden for her and I take her on a short walk every day on my lunch break or after work (I WFH) but I can’t help feeling like she’s a bit bored. 

How can I improve the quality of her life? 

Getting another dog is not an option at this point.

I love my animals........but,"I love my cat and dog, but this morning they are working together to tick me off. I left the room for less than 5 minutes to get a cup of coffee and my dog peed on the floor then my cat knocked a bunch of stuff off the table into the pee. Included in the stuff she knocked off was a container full of change and a few bills so now I have to literally launder my money. At least some of the pee was soaked up by a magazine. Sad part is I haven't even read that issue yet, because I had just gotten it yesterday.

Also for anybody that says I should have taken my dog out right when I got up I did. I guess he had a little extra left in the tank.🤷‍♂️",2024-04-10 18:13:43

My 'Fixed' kitty is definitely pregnant. What do i do?,"we got our lil fuzzy friend last june and were told she was fixed. Somehow i missed the window of time that she was in heat, but it turns out my roommate saw it but failed to mention it to me AND failed to keep her inside.  
Were estimating she was in heat roughly 6 weeks ago. what do I do? Does she need to go to the vet? I highly doubt she could be fixed and or have the pregnancy terminated judging by how plump she is right now.

Stray kitten ,"
Hey guys so basically I need help deciding what to do me and my partner have argued a lot over a stray kitten I have taken in. (We live in separate houses) it’s about 8 weeks old and the mother is definitely feral but when we got the kitten, it hasn’t hissed or bit me or my roomate from the get go she has let us pet her and pick her up without any issues.
It’s day 2 now she’s starting to play with toys and is more trusting, the argument is more over if it will grow up and over 5 years turn feral and rip apart our fur babies that already live with us. Our cats are indoor house cats, we have kept them all separated the kitten strictly in the bathroom while the other cats have free rein of the house I’m just not sure what to do we are waiting till we can take her to the vets to get bloodwork done. but we were told to wait til she’s adjusted for a week then take her. I’ve given her the appropriate medication for worms mites and fleas and all that and also a dose to our cats just to be sure. 
Also the cats have seen each other through the shower screen and there was no aggression from any cats? Please help ",2024-04-10 14:20:19

Need your advise 🙏,"There are several feral cats near my house, I saw a white cat in really bad shape since January at the time he had a horrible  lesion in his nose (or lack thereof) I’ve tried to catch him ever since and only saw him again 3 days ago,since then I’ve been giving him food and water but his physical appearance has worsened, he no longer has his nose or mouth, I feel so guilty that I didn’t search for him more before but I would place the trap and catch other cats 😭, since then I managed to trap him and take him to te vet,  the prognosis is not good at all, the vet straight away said that he had really advanced cancer and that he  was suffering a lot and that treatment at this point is not viable, I wish I could do more for him and just thinking about having to put him to sleep after he trusted me to help him makes my heart shatter, please what would you do? 
I’m seeking a second opinion tomorrow but the vet that I saw today said that even if he could receive treatment it would be a very dififcult road since he is feral and aggressive towards humans, thanks so much for listening to me 🙏",2024-04-10 12:01:56

My cat is leaking brown liquid from her butt when she’s sleeping,"It all started when I noticed my cat purring on my bed and when I was about to pet her, I noticed there was brown liquid in her butt coming out?

Ear Notches,"Has anyone seen these before? I’ve never gotten a real good answer despite it being obviously intentional and symmetrical. And I’ve only ever seen one other dog with them just like my boy Gomez - and they also had no idea why they were clipped that way.


My two leading theories:

A) Marked to indicate part of a specific pack of hunting hounds or belonging to a certain hunter/farmer. This theory falls apart the second you meet Gomez, he barks less than any dog I’ve ever met. Which makes me think he wouldn’t be great at hunting. Additionally he was estimated to be 4 when I adopted him - I can’t imagine it took four years to realize he is not a great hunting hound.

B) Marked as a way to indicate good breeding stock? He has the super traditional foxhound tri color pattern - he’s also quite large for a foxhound. I don’t know for certain those are ideal traits but maybe. 

Would love to find out if anyone’s ever seen it!",2024-04-10 09:38:35

How to give back an animal to the breeder few weeks after adopting it ? ,"I am a young person who just love animal, and i really love birds, for a looong time i wanted to have one (and more than one cause what i love is parrots) 

I work in zoos so i know how to take care of parrots, i did it in a lot of zoos, i also love to read on internet on how to keep a parrot. I know how to take care of one and i bought everything i needed to

I was so happy to go and get my new parrot (one first to understand better how to live with parrots and then others so my bird can have a flock and be healthy) 

But i have her for few days now, and i think i cannot keep her for i am not mentaly stable, and it's way worst since i have her. My poor mental state never was a prob for me to take care of animals, (for my job or for my own dog) but since i came home with her, i have a level of anxiety way too high, the higher i ever had (and i have a lot of anxiety) 

I found out that i am not mentaly prepared to have a pet parrot (i'm quite young) and i could only find this out by bringing one home. And this anxiety is gettong me sick (cant sleep, cant eat, i want to throw up all day) 

I feel like shit to have to ask the breeder (a really good one) to get my parrot back and find her a better place, but i know it's better for me and her. 

Did any one else ever get in this kind of situation ? Do you know how i should ask the breeder ? Have you ever had this kind of situation as a breeder ? 

Thanks for reading all of this, and please dont tell me that i should have been ready, i was, i couldnt know i woulnt work without trying ",2024-04-10 05:33:18

My dog has become insanely nervous the last month. ,"We’ve had a dog and a cat in the house for many years now (our cat is 11 years old, and dog 7). I don’t know why, but we always had this routine of giving them both a treat every morning. It was usually milk (I know that dogs  and cats are lactose intolerant now, but didn’t know then). So they always came up every morning to get their small treat. We always gave our dog something small from the table too. 

I although, stopped with this a few years ago. But only recently we came to agreement that we will stop giving them milk, and that if we give them any treat, it should be done without them seeing us put it in their bowl so they don’t beg for food all the time. 

Our dog gets a daily set amount of dog food, which we just ration out through the day. But lately, since we stopped giving my dog unnecessary treats, I feel like she has become insanely restless. 

This especially happens when I or anyone else comes home from whatever. For me it’s when I get back from school, she gets insanely excited and stressed, and always heads to her bowl, even though she knows it isn’t time to be fed. This isn’t the normal type of excited that dogs get when their owner arrives home, this is another level. I can tell it isn’t purely because of me arriving home, it’s because she instantly expects me to give her something even though I personally stopped doing so already a few years ago.

What could be the reason for this? Why has she become like this now??",2024-04-10 04:40:17

Flea treatment for dogs given to cat," I went to the Vet this week to get a regular spot on flea treatment for my cat. He is an orange european cat, 7 years old and 5,5kg with some mild renal issues.

The lady at the counter accidentally gave me a Vectra 3D spot on solution for DOGS between 4-10kg. 

Obviously I trusted the vet so I didn’t question it at all, I ended up administering it to my cat today and after about 2 hours he started shaking his hind legs for no reason and becoming really sleepy and dizzy. 

I called the vet immediately and they recommended I give him a bath with warm water and some soap and he seems to be all better now. Still monitoring him though. 

My question is if this ever happened to anybody on here? What was the outcome and what did you do in the situation, should I be worried, is this lethal?
Id also like to know what are my legal options in this case? 

I’m afraid this has caused my cat some kind of irreversible damage. ",2024-04-10 04:08:30

To give or not to give flea/tick/heartworm medication to a dog who’s had 1 seizure ,"I can’t decide what to do, our 2 year old dog had 1 seizure back in December. Reflecting back on it, my partner and I are confident that he had a concussion which caused the seizure. My partner was playing with him on the floor and they bumped heads really hard, then only minutes later, he had a tonic clonic seizure.
At first, since we hadn’t come to the concussion conclusion yet, we blamed the flea and tick medication on his seizure since he got a dose 3 weeks prior to the seizure. He was on the flea/tick medication his entire life up until December with no issues. 
His parents have no history of seizures so I’m confident it isn’t genetic.  

We live in Ontario and yesterday we removed 5 ticks from him after a hike. We initially chose to go the natural route since I know flea and tick medication can cause neurological issues, and with the seizure, I felt that he was predisposed to having another one if this medication was to be given.

Clearly the natural spray and shampoo I used did not work because he was covered in them. 

It’s making me very anxious not having him on the medication because I don’t want him to contract a disease from the ticks and/or heartworm from a mosquito. But I’m also terrified of him having another seizure.

Any advice on this topic will be greatly appreciated! ",2024-04-10 03:25:31

should i go through surgery or put down my cat?,"
Hi, I’m in a really difficult situation deciding what to do about my cat. Her name is Itchy and she’s almost 16 years old. I only adopted her 2 years ago and her previous owners never took her to the vet so she has no previous medical records. 

I had her checked up when I got her and got her vaccines, everything else looked good. Last December, I noticed she was coughing and vomiting more than usual. I brought her in, but the vet said they saw a bit of fluid in her lungs but cough medicine should be enough to resolve her issue. It got better but only for a bit.

Her coughing came back in February, and I brought her in again. This time the vet tested her blood and she has hyperthyroidism. She was put on 2.5 mg 2x a day of methimazole for about a month. She got tested after a couple weeks and she had a positive reaction to the medication and her thyroid levels were going down (but not to normal levels yet).

I recently moved to a different state and was setting up a new vet appointment for her but I noticed she was breathing harder than before. I was waiting to bring her in to the vet, but one day she was panting trying to breathe and I bring her to the emergency vet. They told me she was in more critical condition and tapped her to get a lot of the fluid out and had to keep her in an oxygen tank overnight.

They came back with the diagnosis of Pulmonary Carcinoma (lung cancer) on her left lung. I don’t know how bad it is since they were only able to take an aspirate. She can’t go under anesthesia due to her thyroid levels. The vet says if I don’t do anything about it, the fluid will eventually come back and I have to consider her quality of life.

The emergency internal medicine vet is recommending that I give her a higher dose of thyroid medication and wait for it to go to a normal level to do a CT scan and eventually surgery to get the tumor removed. She said there is pretty much no other solution than getting the tumor removed somehow, either through surgery or radiation therapy. She said that if Itchy’s thyroid levels are normal, she thinks Itchy will be okay going through the procedure even at her older age.


I’m torn of what to do. Price isn’t a concern to me, I just want to make sure Itchy is comfortable. I’m scared that something will go wrong under anesthesia, and even if i decide to do surgery and it goes okay, I’m scared that she will be even more uncomfortable going through the recovery process. 

I could also monitor and see when the fluid starts building up again and have her tapped, but that’s a quality of life concern I have to think about. 

It’s tough for me to even imagine what she’s going through. The vet said that she should be pretty comfortable right now since she just got her fluid removed, and she’s still the cute purring cat as before. I don’t want to make the wrong decision or put her down too early.

Please help!!,"My 6-7 year old rag doll cat(f) recently got diagnosed with heart problems. She now needs to take a pill for the rest of her life.

Problem is is she will NOT take it. We’ve given her allergy pills before with no issue, but for some reason she does not want to take this pill.

We’ve put it in baby food, crushed it up and put in in baby food and tried applying it with a syringe, weve tried just putting the pill down her throat. No matter what she ALWAYS throws it back up and has a foamy mouth for a half an hour afterwards.

Advice on ACL tear,"My senior rescue dog (11-12 year old terrier mix, about 20 lbs) tore his back, right ACL. The vets put him in a cast and sent him home with two pain medications.

The tear happened 3 days ago and he will barely eat, drink, or use the bathroom which is very rare for him because he usually marks everything in sight and drinks more than his body weight. I'm just not sure what to do. We can't exactly afford the surgery but even if we could, I'd be worried because of his age and previous heartworm issue. Any advice?

They seem untouched so does his litter. I cleaned the house and still couldn’t find him. I’m scared that his hurt. It’s going on the third day of him missing and I’m worried.

If he was eating at night I wouldn’t care where he is hiding but I’m scared he’s hungry and hurt. Help. 

UPDATE: Got a dog to come to the house and sniff him out but this was futile. Expanding the search to outside 

UPDATE: FOUND HIM!!! He was relaxing at a neighbors place this whole time.",2024-04-09 22:09:41
Registering a current pet,"I currently live in an apartment with my cat, but she is not registered with them. I was going to move to another apartment and register here there, but plans fell through and now I have to resign and move into a new unit in August. I can’t live with the fear of getting caught having her here anymore, and want to register her, but my apartment requires shot records. The records show I adopted her last year. Do you think they’d realize this and I’d get in trouble? Not sure what to do. ",2024-04-09 21:47:38

Black moore in New tank staying in same spot?,"I got a black moore goldfish a little over a year ago amd he was super small at first so he lived in a 10 gallon with some mystery snails. He has since grown and I moved him into a 29 gallon tank with his snails. The tank has been cycling for about 2 weeks and the nitrite , nitrate , and ammonia are 0. He seemed to be reacting really well at first by exploring all the new decor / hide and playing with his new bubbler. He is now only staying on one side of the tank kind of in the middle. I was worried he isn’t getting oxygen but he seems to be more in the middle and not gasping for air at the top or anything. I have a 45 gallon filter and a 6 inch bubbler with a 10 gallon pump because the 60 gallon pump seemed to be too extreme. Could he just be settling in still? I am a little worried with him only staying in one area.",2024-04-09 21:31:41

Dog twitching and having seizures - need help and advice,"I’m not sure where else to post this but I was hoping someone else may have experience with this? 

My husky is about 10 - 12 years old not sure exactly as he was adopted from another family when he was about 6 (we think) and we have had him for about 5 years. He’s definitely an older boy as he is slowly developing Cataracs and has a bit of arthritis in his hips and back legs 

In the last 8 months he has began to have seizures 
He has had 3 that I have been there for, 
The first and second were 4 months apart and the next was 2 months apart and it is now coming up to another 2 months.. 

It’s very strange what brings on a seizure is when he is spooked by something 
He is extremely sensitive to high pitch noises like clicking fingers or clapping, 
The first one was caused by me opening the loud lock on our back door to let him outside, the second time was me clapping, and the last time was jingling of my keys!
When not seizuring he still flinches so bad when these noises happen I actually have to put him outside when I am doing things because I can’t even take plates out of my cupboards without him flinching and possibly setting off a seizure

In the last week he has become increasingly worse and is actually loosing control of his back legs and collapsing when a noise sets him off - even him drinking out of his water bowl can set him off! 
I’m not sure if these are possibly mini seizures? 

The vets have said that really the only thing I can do is drive him 1 hour and a half to the nearest big city and get a CT or MRI scan done on him, for them to not even be able to tell me if and what is wrong and pay upwards of $2000 - $4000 for this, then whatever else is needed to fix the problem 
I do it want to put him through that stress if I do not have to as he hates the car and I’m concerned because he is old if something happens when he is put under anaesthetic
I also do not want to have to pay all this money when he is already so old and might only last a couple more years 
I do not want his last years to be treatment for some illness 

Other than this issue he is absolutely completely healthy! He has a good heart and his other organs are in good shape too! 
I just was hoping someone has experienced this and can give me some direction?

I love him very much and I absolutely hate seeing him go through this and get frustrated at himself because he can’t do things normally ",2024-04-09 20:32:35

"Will my cockatiel be okay being in his cage, which he hates, for 6 hours straight?","I am going to travel for vacation with my family. The place we're going is in theory 6 hours away, but really it might take us more to get there.
I have one cockatiel who was handfed, hand raised and spoilt rotten since he was a baby. As a result, Bilbo, that birdie, hates his cage. Taking him to the vet takes forever, because we spend too much time trying to get him in his cage so we can take him. Even though, he does have companions, but they have their own cages which they don't like to leave, so he doesn't spend much time with them (from what we say when we're home, though he doesn't like their absence). 
Me and my family will be gone for five days straight, returning on the sixth day. I don't want to leave him home, because I worry he'll feel lonely and think we abandoned him. I don't want him to feel sad, especially because I have read about cockatiels going into depression when they think their human buddies left them. But taking him will include putting him in his cage in a moving car with dark seats for 6+ hours.
So, really I need someone with experience on adorable clingy cockatiels who's had to be away from home for some time.
We're due to travel tomorrow.",2024-04-09 20:21:18

My cats won’t get along,"Hi
Back in October 2023 I rescued a male cat that is around eight months old now. He is super active and loves biting and his definition of fun is being aggressive in a playful way. A few weeks ago I adopted a rescued 2 years old female Persian cat and she’s super calm and rarely plays around. They coexist but she will not let him get close to her. He tries to tease her and play with her but she doesn’t like that and would rather live in peace but he’s super playful. Whenever he tries to play with her she hisses at him and hits him. 

When i first adopted the persian cat, my male cat was in heat. I thought that was what annoyed her so I got him neutered late march but they still won’t get along :(

How can I help them get along? ",2024-04-09 18:50:29

Question about adopting from a friend ,"Hi all. I adopted my cat from a friend who was looking to rehome her a few years ago. I got all the adoption paperwork from her and was under the impression that she had contacted the rescue to update the owner name from her to me. Turns out that wasn’t the case. I’m planning to contact the rescue to update that information, as my city requires pets to be microchipped and registered. The microchip has my information, but looks like the registration may have expired.

Is there a downside to contacting the rescue? Any danger of them taking her away since I wasn’t on the official paperwork the past few years? Thanks in advance ",2024-04-09 18:39:50

Advice needed for Cats Fighting,"Hello. I'm running into some trouble with a few of my cats. It started when my cat Holly got a UTI because she didn't like litter box liners. We got her some meds from the vet but I noticed my other cat Meowlitov started being more hostile towards her. Fighting her and cornering her in places. Holly began to get better and symptoms began to subside but I noticed they started up again whenever she would be attacked. I thought it might be because of stress. We tried a thunder vest for Meowlitov to see if she would calm down and it hasn't helped. She just had a second round of antibiotics. But I noticed symptoms came back when she was attacked again. 

The cats can roam as they please. Holly stays upstairs and doesnt venture downstairs bc she doesnt like the dog. I thought maybe a gate might help but with how persistent Meowlitov is in attacking Holly it doesnt seem helpful. I'm running out of ideas. I'm worried about Holly and as long as she is under so much stress she won't heal. Any help or advice is appreciated. Thank you",2024-04-09 14:04:52

I'm worried about Holly and as long as she is under so much stress she won't heal. Any help or advice is appreciated. Thank you",2024-04-09 14:04:52
Cat vomiting after eating. NO IDEA WHAT TO DO ANYMORE, My cat who’s now 1 year and 4 months has pretty much been vomiting after eating since we got him as a kitten. It’s not every single time but its at least 4-5 times a week.  We’ve taken him to the vet many times and tried all kinds of food (he’s on wet food only) but has also vomited when we gave him dry food.   Tried all kinds of prescription diets that the vet recommended including hills biome wet food but nothing helps.   The vomit is undigested food and usually a little bit after he eats. I’ve tried literally the highest quality wet food with like only meat to generic cat food brands. Honestly don’t know what to do anymore.   He’s currently on Hills biome and seemed fine on it the last 3 days but just regurgitated again on that just now.  Could someone please help? ,2024-04-09 13:34:54

Sureflap Pet Feeder - Cat Has Figured Out Flap Release Slider - Suggestions?,"Hello all,   


Was kind of at my wit's end, and decided to consult the wisdom of the masses on this one. I have two cats - one is a grazer, one is a fat lard who consumes everything he can. We had to buy one of the sureflap cat feeders, otherwise we'd have to babysit the other cat for upwards of two hours each meal to make sure he ate it all.  


Problem being, we weren't aware of just how food-motivated one cat is. The last several times we've gone out, he has managed to claw and claw and claw until he hooks a nail in the switch that releases the plastic flap part, then he claws and claws until he catches the flap itself and tugs it off, exposing the food below.   


We tried putting duct tape over the release switch, but after we got back from a movie this evening - yep, he's successfully clawed through that too. Does anyone have any suggestions?",2024-04-09 10:55:28

Why does my cat LOVE having something on? ,"I’ve had my girl cat for 4 years. During this time I’ve never really tried putting collars or outfits on her because it’s just common knowledge that cats hate that stuff. However, the few times we have put an outfit on her (a little pumpkin costume during Halloween) she would always calm down and be significantly more content. Recently I got them collars bc a fundraiser was selling them for proceeds to go towards the local shelters. I put her collar on and now she’s so content, doesn’t get riled up as much, and if a cat could blush; she’d be blushing. I know it’s a weird question to ask but I’m so curious as to why she actually loves having stuff out on her when I’ve had her as a kitten and she’s never had reason to like them or associate them with anything before. 

Our boy kitty hates them lol",2024-04-09 10:03:03

i really hate this problematic cat,"at first i had a cat, she was normal. Then my brother got this cat who brought nothing but problems. She had a fungal problem so we kept taking her to the vet. Then she started peeing everywhere and my cat thought this was normal, started doing the same. Ever since then my brother's cat is peeing and shitting everywhere including bed sheets and blankets. I've been trying every method i can find to hide those while im not sleeping but now she has started peeing on them while im sleeping. And she is been in heat for months, she is constantly screaming. I think her heat is never going to end.   
and she is straching herself raw, she is always covered in blood. We tried every method we can find to stop this but nothing works. I really hate the cat but i also feel pity. Like if i let go of her, i know she'd die in the streets but she is really being impossible. She made me, an animal lover, hate all pets. I'm stuck with an animal that causes nothing but problem, who constantly shits and pees everywhere and screams. ",2024-04-09 09:30:01

"Really bad case of fleas, any advice?","Hello everybody. I had my dog away for the weekend at a family member's house who also has a couple pets. Everything went well, I got my dog back, it's not the first time that I've had them watch him either. Anyway about 24 hours after I got him back I was petting him and noticed some flea dirt was in his fur. Come to find out, upon further examination, it was fleas, a terrible case.

He's had fleas a couple of times before but never like this there was only one or two very light case I would say. In these two situations baths with a flea killing shampoo and laundry diligently took care of the issue after multiple baths and really just staying on top of it. This time was different.

For instance during the battle so I'll probably two dozen or three dozen fleas go down the drain, and after rinsing out the black tub two times I still saw some dead fleas attached to the side of the bathtub, or otherwise you need to be rinsed again. So Needless to say he had a pretty serious case of fleas at least the worst that I've ever seen. So a few hours go by, and we're about to go back outside, and I'm doing a cursory check just to make sure there's nothing visible on him, and I'm thinking what are the odds he just had a very thorough flea bath. Lo and behold takes me about 10 seconds to find multiple fleas on his belly alive and well.

I know the flea bath is just for killing what is on him at that moment, it doesn't necessarily keep them off of him in the future I understand that. But to have so many fleas on him so soon? I've never seen this before like I said the flea bath was very thorough follow the instructions and it's never not worked before. So I clearly need to step it up. Around the house I'm gonna be doing some vacuuming and I've already put in all the bedding through the washing machine and whatnot. But I'm feeling like there's gotta be some product out there that I can use. Whether it's for the home, for him, whatever the case might be what do you recommend?

The one thing I'm trying to avoid are those oral medications because he is a epileptic dog and prone to seizures so these things can lower the seizure threshold. However, I understand that the only thing that might be effective at this point might be an oral medication. But I've heard of these drops that you put on their neck, flea collars, home/floor/upholstery treatments, etc.

What do you recommend? Thank you everybody\~",2024-04-09 07:35:38

Can I give my dog a deworming pill three months after my dog sitter gave him 2 by accident?,"Hi I’m new to this Reddit thing so I’m going to try it out. Long story short around January I left for a business trip but I have a small dog. Since it was a 9 day trip I decided to get a dog-sitter instead of flying with him. During that time I left instructions about everything, this is not the first time she has looked after him so I wasn’t worried. So every three months I deworm him at home with a pill, she knows this and has done this before. But this time she gave him 2, I guess she forgot the fact that I did this before I left. I got him check when I got back and everything is fine, he’s healthy. Anyway to get to my question, can I still deworm him 3 months later like normal or do I wait? I know it sounds stupid to ask but we moved countries, and the vets I’ve found seem a little confused. So here I am asking reddit instead. If anyone has any advice,I’m happy to hear it out.

What did I do wrong? 9yr dog lost 2 front teeth,"I am getting worried. My dog is a 9year old chihuahua/jack Russel mix. I have exclusively fed her dry food, outside of wet food on the rare occasion she got sick, and sweet potato slices/green beans as “human food”. She has had her teeth cleaned by the vet 3 times total. When she was a little she has several baby teeth removed that weren’t going my themselves. Her chews are her yak milk bones, bully sticks, and greenies, only ever supervised so I know she wasn’t going anything crazy with those either. 

So why on earth has she lost *two* front teeth in the last 4 months. What am I doing wrong?? I don’t want her to live with her teeth getting loose and hurting before they eventually fall out. I always chalked up my parents chihuahuas losing teeth to them always being fed wet food, but now I’m not sure. Is it a chihuahua thing? I feel terrible that I’ve tried everything I can think of to keep her teeth healthy and it’s not working😭",2024-04-09 06:28:05

Flying with Dog to India from USA: Seeking Advice and Insights,"Hey everyone,

I'm permanently moving from the USA to India in 4 months and want to take my dog with me. She is a 1 and a half-year-old German shepherd weighing around 60 pounds. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with questions and concerns. If you've had experience with this, I'd greatly appreciate your insights.

Process: Could you please outline the general process of flying with your dog to India from the USA? What documents were required? Were there any specific regulations or protocols you had to follow?

I'm permanently moving from the USA to India in 4 months and want to take my dog with me. She is a 1 and a half-year-old German shepherd weighing around 60 pounds. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with questions and concerns. If you've had experience with this, I'd greatly appreciate your insights.

Missing cat,My wife and I recently moved into our first house. We have 2 cats and a dog. Both cats are generally calm and easy going and so is the dog. When the cats were first introduced to the new home they were understandably nervous and went to some typical hiding spots(behind the couch and in cupboards). We went to bed and they were stilling hiding in the normal spots but when we woke up one of them is missing. We’ve search floor to ceiling with no luck. I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions to lure them out or places to search that they might be hiding? It’s been several hours no and there is still no sign of him.,2024-04-09 04:04:15

Things are getting heated between my dog and newish cat.,"I have had my dog for six years, over the last year we've had four different cats come and go (fosters) and she has done okay with all of them. No signs of aggression. 
I adopted a cat roughly a month ago. The cat will walk up to my dog and hiss at her. My dog doesn't seem to like that coming from this cat (again my dogs been fine with every other cat) and when the cat hisses my dogs hackles (fur on back) go up and she has an aggressive bark and chases the cat. 
Tips please? I can't live with them separated (I did that with a foster dog for 6 months and it was hell). I want the cat and dog both to be safe and happy",2024-04-09 03:52:30

Our cat wont stop hitting our new cat,"So my boyfriend and I have had a cat for about 5 months now and she’s currently 8 months old (her name is cali). My boyfriends brother just got a little kitty for himself who is around 4 months (her name is motor). 

Motor is very socialized, as she was a foster cat before getting adopted, so she’s mostly just curious about Cali. Cali on the other hand isn’t super socialized. We’ve gotten past the hissing and super aggressive behaviour but now cali smacks motor. She doesn’t use claws or anything but she will smack pretty much nonstop, and cali will follow her everywhere. It kinda looks like a lion hunting its prey except motor doesn’t care about cali and cali doesn’t show any signs of aggression (besides smacking of course). 

Im just curious as to whats going on, and is there any way we can get cali to stop or do we just have to keep exposing them to each other?

Help Phoenix Area,"I need all the help I can get. I moved in with a girl about a year ago and she owns 3 pitbulls. Two of them being big male dogs. She’s been trying to rehome one of them because she no longer wants 3 dogs.

Last week, the two male dogs were fighting and the dog she wants to get rid of has a pretty bad wound on his leg. She’s now saying she’s putting him down on Sunday. This dog is only 3, he is one of the sweetest dogs I’ve ever met. I simply can’t take him and move out because I don’t have time in the next week to accomplish all of that.

How Do I Prevent My Cat Catching Fleas?,"Okay, so recently, about a week ago I visited a friends house who’s cats just happened to have fleas. I was unaware of this information until I had already held the cats and pet them and snuggled them ect. 
Now I’m TERRIFIED that my cat is going to catch fleas. 
The reason for this is because I didn’t think much of it because I discarded of the clothes and washed em throughly. I’ve even gone to the extent of not letting my cat into my room to avoid any kind of contact with my clothes.

The reason I’m worried is because only around 10 minutes ago, I found a flea crawling around on my bed, I captured it in a sudsy tissue and threw it away. But I’m still afraid that there are more. What are the chances that there are only one?

I mean I haven’t gotten bitten or anything so far and I don’t see any eggs laying around.. 
Are there any precautions I can take to ensure my cat doesn’t catch fleas?

I honestly wouldn’t be able to deal with the guilt of knowing that I brought fleas home to my domestic cat 😓",2024-04-08 23:53:32

My two cats (both male) suddenly started fighting,"I have a two year old recently neutred male cat, and another 8 months old unneutred male cat, I plan on getting him fixed next week. I got my 8 months when he was a kitten, the introduction of the two cats went very smoothly and stayed that way for the 8 months, but they have recently started fighting. My two year old was unneutred until recently and I would notice him try to mount the young one who wasn’t bothered at first but I would still stop the behavior. I then got the older neutred to avoid aggression, however they are still fighting. I kept them seperated when then started fighting and tried slowly introducing them to being around each other again, sometimes succeeding and some other times not. What I notice happening is the older one tries to get close to the young one, sniffs his butt, then the younger one gets upset and starts hissing at him, at that point I usually step in and slowly seperate them to avoid the interaction from developing into a fight. They were mostly fine for a few days, coexisting and eating in the same space normally. But they have started fighting again today. My best guess is the hormone levels of the older one are still not stable and the young one doesn’t like the advances, (I’m not sure why he tries to sniff and mount him honestly) so a fight ensues. I think it is worth mentioning that my older cat is usually very soft tempered although very anxious, while the younger is usually very friendly and unaggressive. Will the issue get better once I fix the other one? And should I keep them completely seperated until then or what should I do??",2024-04-08 23:09:47

Help w food for 11 Strays/1 Pregnant Cat,"Good Morning my Fellow Redditors,
I’m going to make this short and sweet.  Yesterday browsing tiktok I came across a heart felt plea from a woman I follow (I can send anyone the video if they would like to see it).  She is feeding 11 strays, 1 being a pregnant momma and she can’t afford the food to feed them.  She was asking if anyone could donate food.  The video didn’t have many views and only a very few comments, some people offered to get back to her if they found places that donated food, from what I can see that hasn’t been done yet, I emailed her because reddit helped me tremendously during covid when I couldn’t feed my own babies. I told her to come to reddit, share a wishlist of cat food and her story but she doesn’t know how to use reddit so I told her I would do it for her.  If anyone can find it in their heart to buy some of the food she has on her wishlist I know she would be immensely grateful.  From what I can tell from her page (I follow her but we are not friends or close) is she is a single woman raising her children on her own.  So I’d imagine the help would be very much appreciated.  
Thank you in advance to anyone who can help… I’ve attached the wishlist and have my fingers crossed.  Have a great day everyone!

When I got her she didn't have tear stains, but with time she started to develop them and now they won't go away. I noticed that she tears up the most when she's excited (e.g. while playing).

Review: Do not use AE Pets for pet relocations,"*TLDR:* Do not use AE Pets. They leveraged my cat to get $1100.
  
I recently relocated to London from New York with my cat. The company I hired to assist with his travel,  [AE Pets International](https://aepetsgo.com/), concealed a 30% price increase for more than a month and instead leveraged my cat for the money, after both he and I were checked into our international flight.

Like many of you here, I love my cat and wanted to make sure that his travel went as smoothly as possible. I was especially concerned because pets are unable to travel into the UK in-cabin, so my cat had to go in cargo. To do this, I enlisted the help of supposed experts, AE Pets. Quite frankly, their expensive service (they initially quoted $3500, but ended up charging me $4600) was a complete and total disappointment.

After months of communication, and hours after they had told me my cat had been checked in for his flight, they called me to tell me that BA had “unexpectedly” raised their shipping prices and that they needed an additional $1100 immediately. Their claim that this was unexpected is a lie. In after-the-fact emails, they revealed that they were aware of the increase more than a month before our travel date. They even pointed me to a [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/us/pet-animal-travel-costs-iag-cargo.html) article and a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68339043) that clearly showed that this was public information. In these articles, other, more reputable, pet travel companies are quoted as having had to have ""difficult conversations"" about the price increase with their clients. AE Pets also shared an internal chat, from more than a month before my travel date, in which they communicated this increase to their own staff, asking them for help pressuring BA to roll back the increase.  
Despite AE Pets clearly knowing well in advance that BA had changed its prices, AE Pets opted against notifying me and (I assume) their other clients about this fee increase. I find their decision to hide the fact that their service would be roughly 30% more expensive, information they had for over a month, until they had my cat and I was at the airport for my international flight, disgusting.

In our emails, the firm's head explained that, in the past, they have had trouble getting money from clients after their pets had been returned to their owners. His explanation makes it clear that they leveraged my cat to ensure they got their money. How would you feel if someone demanded an additional $1100 while they had your pet? I felt extorted and I expect you would feel the same.

Even now, AE Pets has not explained why they chose not to inform me in advance of the price change. They have also failed to confirm that they have reached out to their other clients and to name a single concrete step they have taken to avoid these situations in the future. Instead, they have blamed BA, told me how they personally felt guilty, and given vague assurances that a ""Protocol has been created for BA."" Given the lack of specifics and their dishonest business tactics, I find this hard to believe.

There were other red flags that should have caused me to question using them earlier in the process. I regret not listening to my gut and instead trusting my cat to these people: 
- They sent me an email canceling a scheduled meeting. However, their system continued to send confirmation emails up to an hour beforehand and never indicated that the meeting was canceled.  
- Their preferred vet was unavailable. They asked me to call around to vets using the USDA list. When I provided them with a list of options, they picked one they had used before. Given that, I have no idea why they wouldn't have just recommended this as a backup and instead asked me to repeat the legwork they had already done.

I would never trust these people with my pet again and truly regret employing them. I hope you do not make the same mistake.",2024-04-08 16:37:10

Feline Leukemia Advice,"Hey guys. I have a sweet little rescue named Ace and was told back in December he had feline leukemia as he had an eye infection and started to kind of deteriorate all over from it. To clarify, we took him in for the infection and found out about the FeLV. Anyhow, after treating the little guy he got quite a bit better and returned to himself for a period of time then all of a sudden about a week and a half ago… he sort of began withering away (for lack of a better word). As of today, no more eating anything (up until this point I’ve given him several food options and even catnip tea and water choices just trying to help him get any kind of nutrition… well they’re still available to him but he’s not into it at all), as well as no more walking around. He probably weighs a couple pounds now. Feels like skin and fur and bones… just trying to keep him as comfortable and loved as possible.

I guess my question is for anyone that has experienced this… how long does it take them to pass, what are the stages, and what if anything should I be doing to make him comfortable? I feel as if I’m somehow failing him. Any advice?",2024-04-08 10:50:23

Feline Leukemia Advice,"Hey guys. I have a sweet little rescue named Ace and was told back in December he had feline leukemia as he had an eye infection and started to kind of deteriorate all over from it. To clarify, we took him in for the infection and found out about the FeLV. Anyhow, after treating the little guy he got quite a bit better and returned to himself for a period of time then all of a sudden about a week and a half ago… he sort of began withering away (for lack of a better word). As of today, no more eating anything (up until this point I’ve given him several food options and even catnip tea and water choices just trying to help him get any kind of nutrition… well they’re still available to him but he’s not into it at all), as well as no more walking around. He probably weighs a couple pounds now. Feels like skin and fur and bones… just trying to keep him as comfortable and loved as possible.

I guess my question is for anyone that has experienced this… how long does it take them to pass, what are the stages, and what if anything should I be doing to make him comfortable? I feel as if I’m somehow failing him. Any advice?",2024-04-08 10:50:23
Future golden retriever puppy and cat with feline herpesvirus,"I have two resident cats under 3 years old. Looking to adopt a golden puppy over my summer break as a teacher. The oldest has FHV, which I found out when he had pink eye due to stress. My cousin’s kids stayed the night and he was cornered and scared of all the noise we’re not used to (no kids). My other cat is a social butterfly and did not cause oldest to have a stress related flare up of FHV. My fear is this will cause pink eye… I guess I won’t know unless I try. Is a puppy worth a chance to have to sit on top of cat with eye drops for a week straight? 😫 Any positive stories of adopting a dog with this kind of situation?

Debilitating pet guilt and worry over ex-cats,"Long story short had two cats with my ex, he had to take them when we split up as I moved back in with parents who already have plenty of pets. Heartbreaking enough, had to delete all the pictures of them because I send myself into depression even looking at them. Out of nowhere almost a year on, he messaged me the other day asking if I could take them as he was moving into a flat that didn’t let pets, i told him I couldn’t but offered to help him find a good home and I found one, but he never replied. Got my mam to text him, my friend to text him, I texted his mam, his brother, his girlfriend and nothing. I haven’t been able to sleep for days worrying about them and why he isn’t answering. The guilt and what I should have done better is affecting me so badly I genuinely don’t know what to do. I am aware he’s not going to reply for whatever reason (although I cannot accept this) but how do I get over or at least start to deal with the guilt or the horrific what I could and should’ve done mindset. I simply can’t accept that I’ve failed and abandoned them and now they could be on the streets or dead for all I know. ",2024-04-08 09:33:43

How to rehome a pet the best way possible?,"Hey. I know the title may spark some anger, but I have no other choice but to give my 2 year old Australian Shepherd away. My dog is my favorite thing in the world and I love her so much: she is trained, gentle, and a velcro dog. My parents got me my dog with the promise of keeping her while I was in college (I was 16 when I got her) and I was totally fine with this. We were super financially secure and could give her the best life ever.

I can’t really get into the details, but in the span of two months from April-June of 2023, my parents got a divorce, my mom was diagnosed with a bad case of schizophrenia, my step dad (who was providing the money) left, my mom went absolutely crazy, and it got to the point where I had to escape the house because it was an abuse situation. I know, it’s a lot. Well, I was now 16, living in my car, with a hyper Australian Shepherd puppy and $50 in my bank account. In a moment of desperation, I went to my grandparents house and they welcomed me to live with them, but due to my grandpas disability, having a big dog wouldn’t work. Thankfully, my aunt took in my dog, but we came to an agreement that the month before I went to college, I would have to figure out where she was going cause she couldn’t stay.

Now, I’m two months away from being 18, accepted into college, and it’s looking like I’m going to have to find a house for my dog soon. It’s really heartbreaking, because I imagined having my baby her entire life, but I’ve come to terms that she deserves the best life with an amazing family.

Now that I’ve swallowed the pill of giving away my dog, I have to find the said “amazing family.” But how? It’s not about the money, but I’m scared that my dog is going to go to a bad family if I don’t put a price on her. And what platform do I rehome her on? Craigslist or ebay is totally off limits because she is 10000% worth more than that. How do I do this in the best way possible for her? ",2024-04-08 09:20:48

Dog and cat ,"Hiya. So basically I got a puppy a few months ago. She is now four months old and I’ve had my 1 1/2 year old cat since she was a kitten when I first got Nala (pup) princess (cat) wasn’t too bad with her, apart from a few hissing and trying to swat her it was all good. For the past few days, princess has been getting a little bit too aggressive so Nala will try and play with getting in the dog pose, barking, bounce around et cetera and princess doesn’t like it at all. So normally princess will just smack Nala (no claws) and hiss. But for the first time the other day, Princess literally chased Nala around, claws out hissing, tail puffed up, back hairs and everything. Now even tho pup is only 4 months, she’s 3/4stone and her head reaches just above my knee I’m 5’4 and she was literally yelping. Princess didn’t hurt her I think she was just scared. What can I do? Cause it’s happened twice since then. Princess use to give signs to Nala and still does, but Nala doesn’t listen (I know she probably doesn’t understand) I don’t want to have to rehome one but I’m scared Nala will get hurt or when Nala gets bigger she will go for princess. It’s strange cause they use to be fine. ",2024-04-08 07:59:29

Dog scab won't heal,"

He had surgery months ago, and while it was a struggle, he healed 95% thanks to some antibiotics and steroids, but then he licked it open. We realized that not only would he lick the leg, but so would our other dog. We tried a leg sleeve, but he licked the sleeve and opened the wound. I've been fighting this issue for so long that I feel disheartened. I don't know what else to do. Currently, he wears the leg sleeve and a cone, but if I even slip up for five minutes, there will be a month setback.

 Please guide me. Thank you.",2024-04-08 07:17:41

Why do some people see dogs as almost objects?,"Scrolling on Instagram, I understand dark humor as I use it a lot but a lot of times I see a video of a dog and the comment section has people talking about punting it or stomping it and there’s like thousands of likes and they seem so real about it too.

I get that not everyone is going to love dogs but the amount of people that straight up don’t care if they abuse an animal is insane to me. I know a lot of them are jokes but I compare it to someone constantly joking about doing the same to humans and it comes off as psychotic.  Pets in general are innocent and people are not.

Reactive dog with newborn baby ,"I live with my parents and I got myself a Belgian Malinois who lives in a house with us (we have  yard). When he was young we went out in public, to places where there were dogs, he played with them, we even went to a training course..but when he grew up he became very reactive to other dogs and sometimes showed aggression towards strangers. Although we live together with my parents, he does not listen to them and they cannot control him. my working hours are two days work for 12 hours and two days off and dog always stayed with my parents who are retired so he was never home alone. in the meantime, I found a boyfriend, and 
as my dog is not interested in strangers to bond with them,  so the two of them have not gotten close yet. The ""problem""starts when I got pregnant and im going to live with my boyfriend and dog will go with me... 

Giving a three-year-old dog up for adoption is not an option, nor do I want to, and it can't be with my parents.I can't even pay people to walk my dog while I'm at work because he doesn't like strangers and there's no way he let them get close to him, and my husband also works 10 hours a day...

 I just don't know how I will be able to give the attention to the dog ,to play with him while having baby and after some time start working...unfortunately, dog won't be able to stay in the house to be near me for the safety of the child and my husband because my dog can be very jelaous..*has anyone been or it is in a similar situation and how to handle it.**?!?!???

Does something like an “insurance navigator” for pet insurance?,"Hi everyone, I’m unsure how to phrase this question but I figure I can’t be the only one in the world who has wondered this— I just don’t really know how to search for it. (Also, sorry if this is the wrong sub to post this.)

I’ve had the same pet insurance since I adopted my cat in 2017; it was just sort of automatic and came with her microchip. But, I have no idea if it’s actually any good and kind of have no idea how to parse things like pet insurance or their policies. I’m wondering if my policy sucks, I should get new pet insurance, or if I’m better off sticking to what I’ve had because at least I’ve had it for so long? (She’s 8 now, so IDK if starting a new policy would be a bad idea because now anything from the past 6 years would be a “preexisting issue”?)

Basically, does something exist where there’s some kind of expert/professional I could call, and they could answer my questions, walk me through everything and explain it all like I’m 5? Like they could break down my current policy in a way I would understand, and give me recommendations/help me ACTUALLY figure out where I currently stand and what my options are? Help me compare policies, etc? 

I have no idea who to ask my questions to, and just want someone who can actually explain this stuff to me. Does such a thing exist? Where should I look?

Thanks!",2024-04-08 05:55:59

Does something like an “insurance navigator” for pet insurance?,"Hi everyone, I’m unsure how to phrase this question but I figure I can’t be the only one in the world who has wondered this— I just don’t really know how to search for it. (Also, sorry if this is the wrong sub to post this.)

I’ve had the same pet insurance since I adopted my cat in 2017; it was just sort of automatic and came with her microchip. But, I have no idea if it’s actually any good and kind of have no idea how to parse things like pet insurance or their policies. I’m wondering if my policy sucks, I should get new pet insurance, or if I’m better off sticking to what I’ve had because at least I’ve had it for so long? (She’s 8 now, so IDK if starting a new policy would be a bad idea because now anything from the past 6 years would be a “preexisting issue”?)

Basically, does something exist where there’s some kind of expert/professional I could call, and they could answer my questions, walk me through everything and explain it all like I’m 5? Like they could break down my current policy in a way I would understand, and give me recommendations/help me ACTUALLY figure out where I currently stand and what my options are? Help me compare policies, etc? 

I have no idea who to ask my questions to, and just want someone who can actually explain this stuff to me. Does such a thing exist? Where should I look?

I don’t wanna loose my boy,"Hi. Im a teen and living with my family. We have a family dog that we've had since 2016 (he's 7 now) he's a very large labradoodle. He's generally very sweet, but he has a habit of opening drawers to eat food, jumping up on counters to get stuff, opening the trash, eating my parents mouth guards that they wear at night and even used pads and tampons. My family has done some things to get this to stop. (We put out trash outside so he can't get to it) but other issues like the mouth guards still exist. My parents are debating whether we should give him a way and get a new dog. When I heard this I was shocked, were the type that rescues animals and give them the best until their end. I don't wanna loose my dog that has been with me through a shit load.
Does anyone know of any thing I can do to train him or anything like that to try and keep my boy?",2024-04-08 03:45:53

I hate my cat,"My roommate and I adopted a cat about a year ago together and she’s been nothing but trouble since. Her biggest issue is that she poops and pees everywhere but the litter box. She refuses to even be near the litter box. I’ve tried everything with giving her her own space, trying different litters, I even clean them more often than I already did and nothing has encouraged her to use them. We have 2 other cats in the household and she doesn’t get along with mine, the only male. They’re constantly fighting to the point where hair is being pulled out in chunks. It brings me to tears in frustration because nothing works. I’ve gotten those calming pheromone plug ins, behavior correcting sprays, literally everything to help her out and it’s all a dead end. She ruins my day almost every single day and I hate that I hate her so much but I just want to leave her outside and never let her back in. Vets are ZERO help because they just say that the litter box issues are at this point behavioral and I’m at a complete loss. My last resort is surrendering her, but I’d try to rehome her before bringing her back to the shelter. Has anyone else struggled with these issues? I really don’t know what to do anymore.

How to trim unwilling cat’s claws.,"Hello, my cat has incredibly sharp claws and I would like to trim them just a bit since I am moving in with someone with another cat and I want to make sure he does not hurt the other cat during play time (he hurts me quite a bit when we play through no fault of his own). Thing is my cat is a bit of a psycho and does not under any circumstance like it when anyone touches any part of his legs, let alone his paws. I use the term psycho jokingly of course, but I think he may have been abused (he’s a rescue cat) and so he does not enjoy people touching his legs/paws. Because of this I’ve never been able to trim his claws as he will freak the eff out and try to claw my face out and run under the bed before I even put the clipper anywhere near his paw.



I’m wondering if anyone has any tips on how to tackle this.  
He had a skin condition once and I had to put him in a onesie to stop him from over grooming and just trying to get his legs in through the holes ended with me at the urgent care as he bit my hand so hard that it got infected. So yeah that’s what I’m dealing with. 


Thanks in advance!",2024-04-07 21:59:35

Pup won’t eat ,"Hi, it’s 4am where I am, my dog got an intestinal infection… we live in the countryside and there’s a polluted lake bordering 1/4 of our property. There’s really  strict municipal regulations about building fences around here and we haven’t been able to get the permit to build one preventing the dogs from getting into the lake. She might’ve eaten something from there and she got worms, the worms caused the infection. We dewormed her 5 weeks ago so it probably was after that. Took her to the vet, ran a blood test and x rays of her digestive system. Bought all the medications and medicated food, we have her w an IV drip right now. 

SHE WON’T EAT. She smells the food, maybe licks it, might take a bite and spits it out. I’m nervous and stressed out. Vet told me they had given her an appetite booster and something for the nausea but she won’t eat. There’s only one clinic nearby and they don’t do emergencies so it’s closed right now.

critically low haemoglobin,"My dog (Chihuahua, 10 yrs old) was tested positive for tick fever (babesia) a week ago. Since then, the doc put him on doxycycline and some platelets + hgb meds.

Elderly relative unable to capture violent cat - who can I hire or call to enter their home and capture this pet for transport?,"I have an older relative who lives far away (2000-3000mi) who suffers from mental health issues including depression/anxiety.  Their treasured emotional support cat has unfortunately become violent and needs to be given up.  The time has come to get the cat into a carrier so it can be transported.

Unfortunately due to age, physical limitations, and mental health issues, the owner is not able to do this when the cat has been in an extremely violent state for days.  I am looking to find out if there is a service I can hire that will go into the owners home and get the cat into a carrier or anything similar that is suitable for air travel.  (Owner will absolutely consent and give permission for this.)

I am unexperienced with these sorts of situations and I do not know who to call for this.  I understand such a service may come with a cost.  **I don't know if I should be calling vet offices, the city, etc, and what I should be asking for.**  The cat's next owner is already determined and we don't want to surrender the cat to a shelter (not permanently anyway).

*I am not asking for tips on what the owner can do in order to capture the cat.*  There are mental health issues at work here, I am begging readers to please accept my assurances that it would be easier for me to wrestle a fully grown alligator than to convince the owner to attempt a new strategy for capturing the animal.   **The owner cannot capture the cat and swears they do not know anyone who would be able to.**

*I am not asking for tips on what the owner can do in order to capture the cat.*  There are mental health issues at work here, I am begging readers to please accept my assurances that it would be easier for me to wrestle a fully grown alligator than to convince the owner to attempt a new strategy for capturing the animal.   **The owner cannot capture the cat and swears they do not know anyone who would be able to.**

Elderly relative unable to capture violent cat - who can I hire or call to enter their home and capture this pet for transport?,"I have an older relative who lives far away (2000-3000mi) who suffers from mental health issues including depression/anxiety.  Their treasured emotional support cat has unfortunately become violent and needs to be given up.  The time has come to get the cat into a carrier so it can be transported.

Unfortunately due to age, physical limitations, and mental health issues, the owner is not able to do this when the cat has been in an extremely violent state for days.  I am looking to find out if there is a service I can hire that will go into the owners home and get the cat into a carrier or anything similar that is suitable for air travel.  (Owner will absolutely consent and give permission for this.)

I think the vet didn't fix my cat,"So for context about 3 months ago I had my male cat taken in to get fixed. About 4 hours later we get a call from the vet and come get him and we did all the proper healing procedure stuff that the vet told us to do. I read on the internet on several different cat forums and sites that cats can have there testosterone for several weeks following them being fixed, leading to humping, ect. Okay, that's fine so we kept him away from our female cat when she's in heat. (We haven't fixed her yet as it costs $350 to do and we just haven't had the money or time honestly) 

So as it's been about 6 weeks I start turning a blind eye to watching them and seperating them at night to make sure they don't do the nasty. 

Well fast forward to this week, it's been about 3 months now since we got him fixed and we wake up to an obnoxious cat scream that could shatter windows. I, obviously shitting my pants, jump up and run out to see what thee actual fuck and I run into the living room to see my male cat straight up clappin cheeks on our female cat. She was in heat and they were mid stroke when they got off of each other. Wtf is causing this? I look and my make cat still has his balls. There's definitely a scar from him getting fixed but he's still acting this way. Am I wrong for thinking maybe this vet didn't actually fix my cat? Wtf is going on? ",2024-04-07 12:08:16

They Are Eating Me Alive: A Desperate Plea for Help!,"I've tried literally everything:

* Foggers (with Growth Regulators) applied in every room, two times
* Food-grade Diatomaceous Earth (indoor and outdoor in the garden)
* Vinegar + Soap + Lemon mixture
* Permethrin Spray (indoor and outdoor, on the floor and on beds and sheets)
* Vacuuming many times
* Flea traps
* Repellent Oils
* Electromagnetic wave devices
* Washed every single cloth we have.

I even gave my pet to a friend two weeks ago to treat it in parallel. The cat is okay, but I am not! Fleas are eating us alive—me, my wife, and my three little kids. I cannot sleep! It has been like this for over a month! Please help!

P.S my cat is fully treated and fleas free. I put it in my friend's house temporarily in order not to get reinfected again. It's us -the humans- who have been suffering for weeks regardless of what treatments we tried.  
Also, please don't assume that I did not go to the vet (because I did twice), or I sprayed Permethrin on or around my cat (because I did not), Permethrin was applied after the cat moved out.",2024-04-07 09:46:51

Need a non-perfumed enzyme pet stain/odor treatment,"I've been desperate to find any enzymatic cleaner to treat dog urine/vomit stains and odors that has no added perfume or heavy scent. I'm sensitive to smells and can't stand the lingering odors from products such as Nature's Miracle. They clearly add some scent but it lingers so long. I've tried a few other brands (like Target brand) but it's all the same thing - they add scents that I can't stand. I wouldn't even mind a more 'natural' smelling product (like citrus or mint), but even those have the potential to be overpowering. Any suggestions on a cleaner that has very little of its own scent/perfume added? I'm specifically looking for an enzymatic cleaner (not just an odor eliminator).",2024-04-07 05:42:24

Conservative Veterinary Office on Long Island?,"My ex took our dog to the vet last week in Brooklyn for an eye infection and they said he tested positive for Covid. She refused the dog Covid vax because the vet would not release the list of ingredients in the vaccine and we didn’t want to shoot up our dog with something which we didn’t know of what it consisted. 

They suspended his license for minimum 30 days (which I think is bs) and we will have to get a negative Covid test to re-apply for a new license. 

Is there a good vet on Long Island who will see our dog with a suspended license for a second opinion? ",2024-04-07 02:08:29

Should i move my cat with me or let her with my parents?,"I have a 3 year old cat, i found her on the street and she has been living with us since. Here she has a backyard and she roams around when she wants (i know it's wrong but its my parents home and they let her) but shes mostly inside.
We have 3 other cats and 1 one dog. She tolerates some and dislike some, doesnt seem too attached to any of them though, never sleeps with them (our 3 other cats sleep with my parents and her with me lol), but sometimes they'll play together.
She likes my parents and gets along well with them, but we are very clearly bonded, she sleeps with me every day, meows when im not home, follows me everywhere, is very vocal with me and demands a lot of attention. Overall, she acts like my baby and very clearly prefers me.

Now, im moving out alone, i don't know for how long but i'd say at least for a year (its a situation where a relative died and someone has to take care of the house until it sells, which will probably take years)

The house is lovely, big, and has a nice backyard.
I originally thought i would obviously take her with me, since shes my baby. But my parents have been making me feel guilty telling me this is her home, she'll feel lonely, i can just come visit and if i let her outside shell get lost. At the end they'll let me do whatever i want, but this is their opinion.

I would feel guilty taking her and seeing her unhappy, alone and inside all the time (ill let her outside but i wont let her roam around freely) but i would also feel guilty having her think i abandoned her, and i'll obviously miss her VERY much.
She'd be alone part of the day since i study on the week and work on weekdays but mostly i prefer to stay at home.

So, sorry for the wall of text but i tried to explain it the best i could. I'm at a loss, i don't know what to do.",2024-04-07 01:09:09

We have 3 other cats and 1 one dog. She tolerates some and dislike some, doesnt seem too attached to any of them though, never sleeps with them (our 3 other cats sleep with my parents and her with me lol), but sometimes they'll play together.
She likes my parents and gets along well with them, but we are very clearly bonded, she sleeps with me every day, meows when im not home, follows me everywhere, is very vocal with me and demands a lot of attention. Overall, she acts like my baby and very clearly prefers me.

Now, im moving out alone, i don't know for how long but i'd say at least for a year (its a situation where a relative died and someone has to take care of the house until it sells, which will probably take years)

The house is lovely, big, and has a nice backyard.
I originally thought i would obviously take her with me, since shes my baby. But my parents have been making me feel guilty telling me this is her home, she'll feel lonely, i can just come visit and if i let her outside shell get lost. At the end they'll let me do whatever i want, but this is their opinion.

I would feel guilty taking her and seeing her unhappy, alone and inside all the time (ill let her outside but i wont let her roam around freely) but i would also feel guilty having her think i abandoned her, and i'll obviously miss her VERY much.
She'd be alone part of the day since i study on the week and work on weekdays but mostly i prefer to stay at home.

So, sorry for the wall of text but i tried to explain it the best i could. I'm at a loss, i don't know what to do.",2024-04-07 01:09:09

Cat problems,"Hi everyone, my 8-year-old male cat has been peeing everywhere, forcing us to keep doors closed. He's also become extremely violent at times, harming us, and he loudly shouts at night, disrupting our sleep for years. We're considering letting him go outside, but living in a city, we're worried about his safety as he's not accustomed to the outdoors. He hasn't been neutered. Could neutering him solve these issues?

"On the saying ""age is not a disease.""","So, I'm reaching the end of my time with my dog. He has several diseases (early stage kidney disease, cushing's disease, a history of seizures, arthritis, vet-related anxiety). While things were going great following a 48-hour stay at the emergency vet two weeks ago, this week, his mouth started bleeding. Turns out it's his bottom right canine, and it would have to be removed. He is 17 in two weeks. He's an old guy with existing diseases that make any procedure inherently risky. And I was left in a position of having to decide whether to go ahead with the extraction and the dental, understanding that there' is a chance he may not wake up or that the anesthesia could have lasting negative impacts on his organs, but if all went well, he would have clean teeth and a better quality of life – or moving to palliative care.

It's the point in their pet's life that every pet owner dreads. And I spent days talking it over with family and friends, researching, and asking seeking advice. Over and over I had people say, or I read, ""age is not a disease."" And it made me begin to second guess my decision not to have the dental. But I spoke to my vet yesterday, and that statement isn't as clear cut as people like to make it seems.

**As my boy's vet told us: ""Age is not a disease, but disease come with age.""**

Yes, age is not a disease, and in many cases should not be the determining factor when deciding whether or not to continue treatment. But diseases do come with age, and those diseases can make treatments riskier, can lower quality of life. And it's ok to decide that that you're pet has had enough and it's nearing time to say goodbye.

I'm not really sure why I'm writing this. I guess maybe to help anyone else who is in a similar situation and comes across this saying. Just hearing my vet give more clarity to that statement, and hearing her being so supportive and understanding of my decision for my boy, who is literally my entire world, gave me so much peace. Saying goodbye to our pets is never easy. We never want to do it. In an ideal world, they would live as long as us. But we all have to make the decision eventually, and it's ok to decide it's time, to decide not to continue treatments. We deserve to give ourselves grace during these times, and to know that we've loved our pets with every inkling of our being, and we will continue to do so when they're no longer here with us.

For me and my boy? Right now he's happy and comfortable and not in pain. I know the time is coming, sooner rather than later. It could be days or weeks. But what a blessing it is to know that our time together is coming to an end and to be able to fill that time with so many memories and doing the things he loves most. Making this decision, as hard as it was, means that I am going to be able to say goodbye to him in the way he deserves – at home, surrounded by the people he loves.

Editing to add, because I love this one, too (thanks for it, u/Temporary-Tie-233): ""Age is not a disease. Most diseases are treatable."" Unfortunately, you can't turn back the clock on age, as much as we'd all love to.",2024-04-06 20:49:04

ACL surgery recovery ,"My sisters dog had this surgery on Monday. He is a 30lb pom/beagle mix. This may be a weird question but during the surgery, are the vets able to confirm if the fix is 100%?

My sister and I were both out of the country during the surgery and my mom didn’t ask any additional questions and I’m getting worried because he is still lifting his leg while standing and does not seem anywhere near using it yet.

I’d be giving him to my parents, but it breaks my heart to give him up. Is there anything else y’all can suggest rather than giving up my dog? I want to keep him, but feel the logical decision is to give him up. I’m really heartbroken about this, but have decided that I will give him up at the end of this month.
This dog means a lot to me, but so does my future. I’ve tried the shots and they just don’t work. Do I just quarantine him?? And keep him away from my bedroom?",2024-04-06 13:02:33
Give up my boy,"Over COVID my sister adopted me a dog. I won’t go into the fine details, but he saved me from making rather harsh decisions. I am allergic to dogs and can barely live with my boy.

"my new cat got out of new home, it hasn't returned in more than 12 hours. any advice? what are the chances he comes home?","hi everyone. it's so heartbreaking writing this right now but my 4 year old sweet boy who i adopted recently from michigan (i live in NJ) got out of the door - it wasnt latched closed and it was windy so it sprung open. he's only been at the house for 3 days and hasn't been out much. my boyfriend was home when it happened and he saw him and when he saw my boyfriend he ran away. he was seen 6 hours later by a neighbor but we still haven't found him. we left cat food, his blanket, and water outside. he hasn't come home yet. i went around the neighborhood all day and haven't found him. posted on FB and just made some flyers. the past owner told me he was an outdoor/indoor cat and he has disappeared a day before and has come back at night but i'm really really anxious because he's never been out before and i don't know how he will find his way back home. i miss my sweet boy and i can't stop crying. he's my first cat and i love him so much and im just praying he comes home. i have so much fear in me that he got in a dumpster somehow or the sewers and im so worried for him. i dont think i can live with myself if something happened to him or he doesnt come home",2024-04-06 13:02:05

There is a couple living in a car outside my building with their great dane… Should I call someone or let it be?,"For the past 2 weeks, there’s been a couple living in their small Mazda hatch with their fully grown great dane outside my apartment building. I see them sleeping in the front seats while their great dane sleeps in the back. Obviously, these are miserable conditions for all 3, especially considering that it still get below freezing at night. Now, I don’t know their story. They could have fallen into a very unfortunate situation and were forced to live in their car. They could’ve lost their jobs, lost their home, or are going through something else. Most likely something unfortunate happened since I doubt that they would have gotten a dog if their situation was tough.

Sometimes, they are gone during the day (or even worse, at night) and leave their dog alone in the car. I like to give them benefit of the doubt during the day that maybe they’re out trying to fix their situation, but at midnight I’m not too sure. The car does not move, so I guess they must go on foot. Over the past 2 weeks, I’ve seen them take the dog outside the car once, and I’m out 4 times per day to walk my dog. I can’t imagine how depressing it must be for a dog of any size, let alone a great dane to be confined to a space not even large enough to fully lie down. 

Tonight, while taking out my dog, I looked at the car and noticed some movement. I looked closer and their great dane was awake and looking at me and my dog, and his owners were not in the car. It completely broke my heart. He looked so sad. I’m now contemplating my options. Now I know that all signs point to calling someone like animal protection or the non-urgent police line, but I’m hesitant for a couple reasons.

I just feel like if I do something, I’d be potentially taking this dog away from its owners for what’s maybe only a temporary living problem, making their lives even more sad. Also, I’d be taking this dog away from likely the two people it loves the most. I could approach and talk to them to try and understand and see if they need help, but I feel like I’d be overstepping and getting involved in something that I shouldn’t. 

If you were in my position, what would you do? I feel for the dog but also for the owners, and I would hate to make their situation any more depressing. ",2024-04-06 12:47:41

I don’t know how to handle this (new fur babies after pet loss),"This is long so my apologies: 9 months ago i lost my best friend. I'm F23 and the oldest in my family of 4. I live a few hours away bc of college but my parents and sibling still lived with my bubs when he was alive. I knew they had it harder trying to heal from his loss because they had to deal with it while being in the same house my bubbies walked and played and slept. For me, I felt that I was able to heal and move on faster and healthier, that my grief was minimal. I think the distance helped. I had it rough obviously the first few months, but now I thought I was good. Just yesterday I could talk about him and our memories and laugh. Look at old pictures and listen to our song and smile without breaking down.
But my family facetimed me today and surprised me with two new puppies. They're so cute, and adorable and my parents and sibling were so happy.
But the moment I saw one wrapped in my bubbies's blanket, I lost it. And now I'm spiraling. It's like the day my bubs was put down. I can't stop crying and I don't know if I can handle meeting my new fur brothers. Idk what to do, so any advice for those who got new fur babies after the loss of one? I genuinely just need some advice and help from a community who hopefully understands. I don't know how to cope.",2024-04-06 12:34:21

advice on how to get cat and dog acquainted? ,"sorry if i wrote too much for how small this is i just tend to + i want to give as many details as i can for advice

i just recently moved to a house with my cousin that’s all on one floor. i have a cat (around 7?) and she has a dog (10 or so.) my cat is not a fan of dogs and im not entirely sure how the dog is with cats but my cousin has kids and previously had ferrets who he was chill with. this wasn’t a problem to deal with before because at the old house i had a big basement for myself for the cat to roam in but now since this house is all on one floor i can’t do that anymore and i REALLY don’t want to keep my cat locked up in my room all day especially since she likes following me everywhere. 😔
so as title says, is there any way to get them both acquainted?? they know of eachothers existence and the dog whines/barks kinda? theyre like Barky Whines when he hears or sees her (he is currently doing so at my door which is why im making this post lol) but im so deeply afraid of him lashing out at her (he’s a biggish dog, forgot his breed but he has a blocky head and i definitely could not hold him back) or something i don’t exactly know what to do. i overthink a lot and im not even exactly the biggest dog fan so i don’t trust myself with this. any advice is appreciated, thank you 💝 also the doggy gate things aren’t really an option as the way where he is to my room is a really wide space",2024-04-06 11:06:06

Our cat keeps sneaking out of the backyard. Suggestions?,"I (26m) live with my grandpas. We have two dogs and four cats. One of our cats is a Ragdoll named Bowser (7-8m). Bowser was declawed by his previous owners (my grandpas didn’t choose that, it was already done before they met him). Therefore, he obviously has to be an indoor cat. Here’s the issue we’ve been having:

One of my grandpas used his share of his mother’s inheritance to put in a big wooden fence in our backyard. The fence does not reach the ground, so the cats and our smaller dog are able to crawl under it. Whenever my grandpas let the dogs out to use the bathroom, the cats wind up joining them (including Bowser). I then have to walk around in circles and sometimes down the street to find him. Thankfully, I know Bowser’s patterns and usually find him between our house and our neighbor’s, but I have to wait 15 minutes or so for him to show up. I try to prevent him getting out by keeping him in my room with me. However, he obviously can’t be in there 24/7 and I also have to go to school (I’m finishing my last semester of college), and of course he sneaks out when one of my grandpas lets the dogs out.

It is a royal pain having to search for him outside almost every day (sometimes twice). What can I do to at least keep Bowser from leaving the backyard when I’m not around? I love my grandpas, but I can’t rely on them to keep him in.

Tl;dr My Ragdoll keeps sneaking out and I need advice keeping him in when I’m not home.",2024-04-06 10:48:59

My senior dog is very sick and we can't care for her,"I am devastated. My Yorkshire terrier mix of 12 years is sick with pancreatitis. She has been doing better this past week but is starting to regress again.

My family doesn't know what to do. We are quickly running out of money to take her to the veterinarian. Part of me believes that this could very well be the start of the end for her. If she lives for only a few months longer in that much pain, is it even worth it for her?

My mom is concerned about finances which is understandable, but I feel like we should keep trying. She's not a toy that we can just drop when she becomes too expensive. What do I do? My parents are considering putting her to sleep, but her quality of life is still good. She's still excited to see us, walks, pees/poops on her own without help, cuddles, etc.

I feel like there is so much more we can do with her, we just don't have the money to continue doing so.

I would be so grateful for any advice :)",2024-04-06 09:01:37

You see, I have various cats but I have other pets too, so, I cant just put all my cats's things around the house, since they will be destroyed. So, my pets have a different room depending on the specie (one room for dogs, other for birds, other for cats etc) just to put their things since I have a pretty big home, like play-rooms. And like everytime I get a new pet I teach them that if they want to relax alone or play with other buddies, they will have to go in their respective room. I have been doing this since my first pet, and everything has gone smoothly. Until, yesterday I told some of my classmates about my little technique but all of them (5 pple) told me that im probably stressing my cats and overwhelming them by putting them just into the room. Just to make it clear, my cats's room is pretty big, its almost like the size of an average living room if not bigger since I know cats in general like privacy (plus, my cats are not the clingy type). And its not like I have the room filled to the top with all sorts of things that it hurts the sight, it has some towers here and there, there is tunnels, puzzles and a treat dispenser (which is half a puzzle too), but apart from that, they still have tons of room to roam in, and they especially like the big window since the sun peeks mostly for that part the window is in. And I may add that it seems that they take it like a seemingly comfort room lol, since when they get mad at me these mfs will just go to their space and ignore me, and of course I dont kept them there all the time. They didnt said anything about my other pets having the same habit, but maybe they are right about my cats's situations? Since all of them had the same opinion, am i doing some wrong?",2024-04-06 08:27:44

bloody discharge when humping ? neutered,"My dog is a 3 year old Pomeranian - since he was young his hobby is to hump toys . However, after being neutered almost a year ago - that behavior somehow went away. 

2 days ago , he started it again - didnt want any pillows to be his victim so opted to buy one of those plushies in the dollar store. Noticed however, that there is bloody discharge whenever he is done.

Has anyone ever heard of or experienced their dog not wanting to use hind legs after oral flea prevention?,"I gave my husky/shepherd mix 50lb dog credelio for 50.1-100lb dogs yesterday at 4pm. Since then she has puked 10 times that I could count and had diarrhea 3 times. She has also presented with excessive lethargy and has stopped using her back right leg, and is hesitant about using her back left at the same time. She will not come out of her crate and is known for nothing more than her EXCESSIVE energy. She is also currently going through heart worm treatment. She tested positive for heart worms 3 months ago and is 2 weeks out from finishing treatment. I have taken her to 2 emergency vets today. The first one could not diagnose anything - they took an xray and everything was clear. Second emergency vet has diagnosed her to the best of their ability with a partial CCL rupture in her back right leg - although the basic tests and manipulations they ran were not conclusive of the diagnosis. They scheduled her for surgery in 3 weeks anyways. I am not confident she has a rupture. Has anyone ever had or heard of side effects like this from credelio?",2024-04-06 06:43:22

Good news about my sick dog!,"My stinky little man (13) was diagnosed with congestive heart failure last September after I took him in for a chronic cough. I was obviously beyond devastated.

She said usually dogs with his condition slowly deteriorate. He still eats, drinks and poos like normal. He still plays like a puppy and loves to snuggle. He’s my spry little gentleman. I hope he’s going to be one of those old crusty dogs that live to be like 20.

Taking in senior stray,"Hi everyone. There’s a senior stray cat at my parents house who has been out there for about 10 years now. I want to take her to my place so she can finally have her own calm and safe space. I am taking her to a vet tomorrow in a carrier to get checked out and vacinnated. Is there anything else i should be doing so she won’t be anxious or anything? 


Update: We brought her in. Everything is ok according to vet. When we brought her in the house she quickly went under the couch, she has not come out of there since we tried talking to her, getting her to play, giving her treats and food. We left her food out thinking she will come out once we go to bed. And the food is untouched i don’t even think she used the bathroom is there anything else i should be doing?

Title: Seeking Advice for My Cat's Malignant Mesenchymal Neoplasia Diagnosis,"

Hello everyone,

I'm turning to this community in hopes of finding guidance and support for my cat, who has recently been diagnosed with malignant mesenchymal neoplasia. After noticing some health changes, we conducted a series of tests, including cytology and X-rays, which revealed this condition.

We are currently considering our treatment options and would greatly appreciate hearing from anyone who has experienced a similar journey. If you have any recommendations for treatment approaches, whether conventional or alternative, or advice on supportive care to maintain my cat's quality of life, it would mean the world to us.

Here are the specifics of my cat's diagnosis and condition:
- **Diagnosis:** Malignant Mesenchymal Neoplasia
- **Tests Conducted:** Cytology report and X-rays
- **Current State:** No prior illness, condition recently surfaced
- **Seeking:** Treatment advice, personal experiences, and any helpful tips

We want to explore all possible options to give our beloved cat the best chance at a comfortable life. Thank you in advance for your time and help.",2024-04-06 03:47:20

At home euthanasia question. ,"Hello all,

My 9.5 year old Rottweiler, Odin, has come to the end of his life and is scheduled for an at-home euthanasia on Tuesday afternoon. 

He was supposed to go to the vet today but couldn’t make it down the stairs. His back legs have been going and over the past two wild weeks he has gone downhill significantly. He’s also 160lbs so carrying him down the stairs was not an option especially since he’s been in a lot of pain recently and has been getting snappy (definitely not in character for him. He’s a very sweet boy but he doesn’t like being touched anymore because of how sore he is. Head pats are still okay). 

Since he hates the vet, he was given trazodone and gabapentin to take yesterday and today as a sedative. He was supposed to take 4 of each in the morning and then repeat at night; followed 4 more of each right away in the morning today, and then 2 of each an hour before the appointment. He only got one dose yesterday morning at 7 and was a complete zombie. He didn’t even drink any water or go to the bathroom all day, so the vet advised skipping the evening dose and giving him a full dose in the morning a few hours before the appointment. 

This morning rolls around and there’s no way he’s making it down the stairs. We were going to move him before giving him the medication. The vet was supposed to open early so he could have a private, stress-minimized visit with no other patients, so we had to wait a bit to call still, and let them know what was going on. 

Odin made it to the living room and while there had what could best be described as a diarrhea explosion. There was also bloody mucus in the stool, which I noticed when cleaning it up. I call the vet and let them know what’s going on and that it would be best to schedule at home euthanasia. 

Odin’s vet is wonderful, and she actually offered to come in tomorrow on her day off to do it. She’s very fond of him and his sassy personality. It was decided that the appointment would be on Tuesday so everyone in the family has a chance to spend a few more days with him. 

Every dog I’ve had euthanized has had the procedure in-clinic, so this is new for my whole family. I was wondering what to expect when it happens? The vet is coming at 4pm on Tuesday afternoon, and Odin will be getting 3 each of the gabapentin and trazodone in preparation for it, the morning of. 

Edit: Odin is stable and comfortable. He has been given a painkiller by the vet but he doesn’t seem to be in any visible discomfort in general. The decision for a Tuesday appointment was done in conjunction with the vet, who is also on standby if things worsen suddenly. Despite being off this weekend, she has said she will come in no matter what. 

Edit 2: Thank you everyone who has shared their stories and letting me, as well as everyone else share in your memories. I’ve been very emotional all day and have cried reading each of them, but they’ve been very helpful in letting me know what to expect. I ordered a clay paw impression kit on Amazon, which I will ask the vet to do for me after he passes because I know I won’t be in any state to do it. ",2024-04-06 02:05:19

He was supposed to go to the vet today but couldn’t make it down the stairs. His back legs have been going and over the past two wild weeks he has gone downhill significantly. He’s also 160lbs so carrying him down the stairs was not an option especially since he’s been in a lot of pain recently and has been getting snappy (definitely not in character for him. He’s a very sweet boy but he doesn’t like being touched anymore because of how sore he is. Head pats are still okay). 

Since he hates the vet, he was given trazodone and gabapentin to take yesterday and today as a sedative. He was supposed to take 4 of each in the morning and then repeat at night; followed 4 more of each right away in the morning today, and then 2 of each an hour before the appointment. He only got one dose yesterday morning at 7 and was a complete zombie. He didn’t even drink any water or go to the bathroom all day, so the vet advised skipping the evening dose and giving him a full dose in the morning a few hours before the appointment. 

This morning rolls around and there’s no way he’s making it down the stairs. We were going to move him before giving him the medication. The vet was supposed to open early so he could have a private, stress-minimized visit with no other patients, so we had to wait a bit to call still, and let them know what was going on. 

Odin made it to the living room and while there had what could best be described as a diarrhea explosion. There was also bloody mucus in the stool, which I noticed when cleaning it up. I call the vet and let them know what’s going on and that it would be best to schedule at home euthanasia. 

Odin’s vet is wonderful, and she actually offered to come in tomorrow on her day off to do it. She’s very fond of him and his sassy personality. It was decided that the appointment would be on Tuesday so everyone in the family has a chance to spend a few more days with him. 

Every dog I’ve had euthanized has had the procedure in-clinic, so this is new for my whole family. I was wondering what to expect when it happens? The vet is coming at 4pm on Tuesday afternoon, and Odin will be getting 3 each of the gabapentin and trazodone in preparation for it, the morning of. 

Edit: Odin is stable and comfortable. He has been given a painkiller by the vet but he doesn’t seem to be in any visible discomfort in general. The decision for a Tuesday appointment was done in conjunction with the vet, who is also on standby if things worsen suddenly. Despite being off this weekend, she has said she will come in no matter what. 

Edit 2: Thank you everyone who has shared their stories and letting me, as well as everyone else share in your memories. I’ve been very emotional all day and have cried reading each of them, but they’ve been very helpful in letting me know what to expect. I ordered a clay paw impression kit on Amazon, which I will ask the vet to do for me after he passes because I know I won’t be in any state to do it. ",2024-04-06 02:05:19
Help: watching elderly chihuahuas and need advice,"Warning that this is gonna be a gross one. Pets, what you gonna do :shrug:

So, context. I have been asked by my grandparents to watch their two elderly long-haired chihuahuas while they are away on a vacation. The dogs are 12 (male, neutered) and 13 (female, spayed). I have been paid for this, and so I do genuinely want to do a good job, but I am feeling a little overwhelmed. 

I'm 23, I have a pet of my own (a 12 year old cat), and I've lived with dogs all my life, so I know how to take care of pets usually. But these dogs are presenting a bit of a.. special challenge. My grandmother refuses to let them go outside, for one thing. She has this paranoid belief that a hawk is going to kill her dogs (which, not to be rude but I laugh internally when she says this. these dogs are FAT, it'd have to be one big ass hawk), so they use puppy pads in the house. Except... they really don't. They'll just kinda piss or shit wherever in the room that has the puppy pads. 

That alone wouldn't be too much of an issue, I'd just clean it up and get on with my life, but the dogs are long-haired and the male is arthritic and limps really badly. They have been tracking their mess.....everywhere. I can't walk in here without my shoes on for fear I'll step into a surprise track of piss or shit. Half the time, by the time I find it, it's dry and caked to the hardwood floor.

I guess my questions are, how tf do I clean up caked old dog shit off hard floors? I've never had it get that bad at any place I've lived, so I genuinely have no experience with this. Also, would it be problematic to try trimming some of their long fur near their butts so that it's less likely to track mess everywhere? It's mostly their tail that's the problem, and for chihuahuas, these two are very chill, so I'm pretty confident I could just trim it with some scissors without it being a big deal (and my grandparents wouldn't be upset about this), but Idk if there's like... a particular reason they should have that long fur on their tail or something. I dunno, I'm feeling anxious about it haha.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",2024-04-06 01:26:09

Mouse pet ,Hi! So I don’t want to get a hamster due to personality differences and rats are too much care and space for me right now but I feel like mice would be a great fit with activity level and care- I also always have veggies and fruit available because of a tortoise I already have.

Has anyone tried Rebound Recuperation Formula?,"My cat(17) is very ill and has zero appetite.  He’s currently suffering from pancreatitis and high liver values.

Looking for some recommendation for GPS dog collar,"Hey all,

I'm on the lookout for a solid dog collar for my dog, and I've got my eye on two contenders: the HALO Collar 3 and the SPOTON GPS Fence. Both seem to have their own strengths and weaknesses, but I'm finding it hard to make a final decision.

Found this [Halo Collar 3 Versus Spoton GPS Fence video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LRuLzxBQ9g) comparison video, and did some research, but would love to hear from people that used these collars. So, if you've got any experience with either one, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Which collar do you preffer, and why?

I've got a few specific questions:

* How reliable is the GPS tracking on each collar?
* Which one offers better features for training and keeping an eye on your pup?
* Are they sturdy enough for active dogs who love to roam?
* Any hidden costs or subscription fees I should know about?
* And overall, are you happy with your choice of collar?

Thanks a bunch for your help!",2024-04-05 21:04:43

Is a pet sitter visiting 3 times daily enough for my cat and dog while I'm on vacation?,"We're heading out for a 2-week vacation next week and have organized for a pet sitter to visit three times daily.

Update: Thanks for all the comments. I've now arranged for my dog to stay with a woman who, along with her two dogs, gets along well with mine.

"My cats are losing hair on their hind legs, I'm not sure why","Truth be told, I don't know much about keeping up with cats. My whole childhood was a blur for me. We had pets, but I wasn't really interactive with them, and now I have 3 cats because I found a love for them, but truth be told,  I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just trying to be more responsible now and properly care for them. 

They're losing hair on their hind legs. Not bald spots, not small patches. Almost as if they were buzzed cut, not short enough to see the skin, but short. I've checked their poops. There's no worms (or at least nothing at eye level). They're still up with their energy. Very playful. Eating normal. Occasionally, 2 of them puke, but it's clear, so I assume they drank a lot of water. No hairballs either. 

Currently, one of them is grooming themselves on the area with short hair.

My third cat hasn't started to lose hair there yet. He's a long-haired cat. I would've noticed sooner. Both of these cats are short haired. I mainly noticed it on the male tuxedo cat because it was more obvious. Now I can tell it's starting to affect my female tabby

What's happening to them? Google says stress, anxiety, parasites, allergies, etc etc. I'm tight on money, I can maybe afford to take them both, but I already live paycheck to paycheck. Should I just take them to the vet? Or am I being dramatic, and should I try alternatives before throwing a good amount of money? ",2024-04-05 13:52:05

My third cat hasn't started to lose hair there yet. He's a long-haired cat. I would've noticed sooner. Both of these cats are short haired. I mainly noticed it on the male tuxedo cat because it was more obvious. Now I can tell it's starting to affect my female tabby

What's happening to them? Google says stress, anxiety, parasites, allergies, etc etc. I'm tight on money, I can maybe afford to take them both, but I already live paycheck to paycheck. Should I just take them to the vet? Or am I being dramatic, and should I try alternatives before throwing a good amount of money? ",2024-04-05 13:52:05
Dog FHO surgery vs closed reduction,"My dog’s back leg dislocated and now instead of putting a dislocated hip back into the socket the vet wants to perform surgery FHO, I don’t know what to do. Should I get a second opinion? She told me she wouldn’t put it back because it’s going to go out of place again because the ligament is damaged. Is that really his only option? He’s a toy poodle mix and is only 3 years old.

Moving on from a pet you had to put down,"We had to put down a cat we rescued. He was severely malnourished when we brought him to the vet. He had bald and infected spots. Ants were already starting to feast on him, and it seemed like he was getting ready to die. He was diagnosed with FIV and we have been prepared for the fact that he won't last long. However, we gave him all the love we could give and were able to spend 4 months with him.  
He was very sickly and didn't gain much weight despite his voracious appetite. However, during his stay with us, he was able to fill up all his bald spots, his eyes were much brighter, and for a time it seemed he was filled with so much energy. Despite all the progress he's made and the frequent visits we've made to the vet, one day he just went very weak and started to breathe deeply and painfully. When we brought him to the vet, his condition worsened -- sepsis continued to eat away at him and he depended on an oxygen chamber to breathe. When we saw him the next day, he could barely stand and his breathing just got deeper and deeper.  
I wish he didn't have to be in such pain, but it is what it is. Can anyone share how they moved on from losing a pet or what were the thoughts that helped you get by? Would love some company right now.",2024-04-05 09:26:39

If I die w/o support…,"I’m a 39 year old single guy, living alone. Iin building a better version of myself, ’ve distanced myself from mentally unhealthy individuals, including family and friends. I’m retired early, so there’s no work expecting me. No religious life. I keep distant from my only neighbor.  I have two dogs at home that I care for like they’re my children, to an excessive level. I also foster aggressive adoption rejects to rehab them, in home. Just in some random pillow thinking, if I were to die, the dogs would have no food or water for up to a week before anyone noticed I’m missing. And even when they do notice, it could be days more before anything is forcibly done about it. 

Family - they’re all unhealthy. I keep the relationships but keep the distance.  I can’t give them access to my house because they abuse it. Including my having to call local police and tell them -do not- force in if my parents ask. Any opportunity of “in case of emergency” comes with intrusions if I don’t answer for a handful of hours.  

Friends - I only have a couple. Neither of which would come looking for me at any period of time, probably. They both have lives, with families.

18 year old cat w/ hyperthyroidism ,"My girl is fairly old now and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism about 2 months ago.

She is in pretty good shape for an animal her age, no trouble jumping on furniture, pretty good eyesight and hearing.

She was put on methimazole and has either good days or pretty bad days/nights. The bad ones include a lot of vomiting and yowling. She's thrown up 6 times today, actually (I have a vet appointment for her tomorrow bc we couldn't get in today). She's also had increased urination and was peeing outside her litter box for a bit (in our bathtub -- we fixed that but always having a little bit of water in the tub, which sent her back to the box).

I just want to do the right thing for her and make sure she's comfortable and I'm beginning to think that putting her to sleep is the best option. She's done the meds, tried the food. The radioiodine therapy is not feasible for us. Despite this, she's still very ill.

Does anyone have any advice? Her mobility is still great and she looks perfectly healthy, so I don't want to feel like I'm doing this before it's really time. But I do know that cats are great at hiding things and how they feel.",2024-04-05 05:21:53

I can't bear the thought that I can't do anything to help the poor animals from abuse and suffering, and it's driving me insane. What can I do to not feel so much hatred towards people anymore?

How do I deal with the animal cruelty in the world and keep myself from getting depressed? ,"Trigger warning ⚠️: animal abuse 

 I don’t know if it’s the right subreddit for this topic but I’ll give it a try. 

For several weeks now, I've been seeing all sorts of atrocities with animals, especially cats, popping up on Facebook and Instagram. I don't want to explain here what I see because it's very upsetting, and my heart breaks in two because I know I can't do anything about it. I continue to wonder why people are so cruel and why I have to live in a world of suffering where cats and dogs, who are the purest souls in the world, are hurt just for people's entertainment.

My Boxer dog had Siezures...,"I have a 9 year old Boxer/Pit mix. Just 4 days ago he had his 1st grand mal seizure. 3 hrs later he had another. He never had seizures ever. We rushed him to an emergency vet and they kept him overnight. Within 12 hrs he has a total of 8 seizures. All his lab test, abdominal ultrasound and chest xray came back fine. The vet really wanted to do an MRI but we were already sitting at a $6k bill and the MRI woukd be another $6k to $7k that we unfortunately did not have. So we opted out of the MRI. He was 12 hrs no seizures so they let us pick him up. He definitely seems like he is having some brain issues. He paces around the house, runs into things, seems to turn in circles to the right more often. He will eat wet food mixed with dry & drink water. He reacts some to the other dogs barking, he sorta tries to chase a ball, he responds to his name some. He doesn't follow any commands. He doesn't sit on his own. He seems like his brain just is not connecting and processing things. He seems very disoriented and unstable when he walks. We have him on a 5 day rescue medication currently that he takes every 8 hrs on top of a twice a day phenobarbital medication. We have 2 more days of the rescue meds to go. I know he went through alot with seizures and I know the medication likely has some side effects and takes some time... but I'm super worried he is not going to recover. Has anyone experienced anything similar? ",2024-04-05 04:43:59

My dog isn’t afraid of storms anymore…,"My dog isn’t afraid of storms anymore. 

I’ve had her since she was 5 months old. I got her when I was 11. Ever since then, she’s been absolutely terrified of storms….I’ve always been very proactive about making sure she’s comfortable during storms throughout her life. 

We were due to get hit with some extremely bad storms the day before yesterday, I made sure to get all grocery shopping done ahead of time so that I could be home to comfort her during the thunder.

We settled in to watch a movie and I had her in my lap wrapped in a blanket when some bad thunder struck. She was unfased. The storm lasted quite a while and she was oblivious to it. 

Then it hit me…..she can’t hear the storms anymore. I did the math…got her in 2006…She’ll be 18 years old in September. 

She’s just always been there. Always a constant in my life for as long as I can remember. Sometimes I forget just how long I’ve had her. 
Sometimes i forget that she used to be brown instead of mostly white (gray) because she’s been this way for so long now. 

She still follows me around room to room, still walks around the whole yard when we’re outside..she’s in good health for a dog her age. It’s easy to forget she’s 17. But the realization that she’s not afraid of storms anymore has reminded me that she is getting older, and she’s experiencing the end of life changes we all go through. 

I’m so thankful she doesn’t have to experience anxiety during storms anymore, but my heart is sad. 

It’s hard watching our pets get older, no matter how thankful I am for the fact that I’ve had so many years with her. 

I wanted to post this little vent. I hope it’s okay here.

How can I become a better bird owner after I failed them?,"Sorry if my English is bad, I'm not a native speaker. I'm also sorry if I'm in the wrong sub for this.

But long story short: I'm a bad bird owner looking to improve the quality of life of my birds. My parents bought some budgies for me and my siblings years ago when we were kids, and eventually we got tired of them like most kids do. I came back from college and saw them in an almost empty cage (the cage is a big Prevue cage like 45"", they never lacked food or water, just enrichments). 

They're now on the older side, about 7 to 8 years old, 2 died, one because of old age, and the other because it was already sick when we got them and the tiny cage they were first didn't help. Only two females remain and I want to make it up to them. 

They sometimes lay eggs too, but since they have no nesting box they just lay them on the bottom of the cage. I'm not sure if I should buy them a nesting box, or just let them be and keep picking up the eggs. I also noticed they sometimes fight for stuff, so I'm planning on buying a bigger cage for them. But I'm not sure what materials are safe or anything of the sort. I also want to start gaining their trust, but I don't know if that's possible at this point. 

I would like if experienced bird owners gave me some advice on what to buy, do, feed, and how to properly care for them. I have an amazon buying list but I don't know if can post it here for people to add stuff they recommend, so just giving product names or descriptions would be very helpful for me.

I know some people will be thinking ""Just re-home them to someone who will take proper care of them"" but I want to better myself and be the one for them.

Thanks for everything!

Advice for partitioning a small space for pets,"I'm at my wits end with my cat. He isn't sick but he has a habit of peeing on beds. I've left clothes on the floor and he hasn't, but any bed. I slept in a hammock for 3 years. I recently got a bed and it's literally in a tent. I came home today and it was kind of caved in like he tried to get on it. Then I found poop under the bed. Idk if it's due to recent changed with my dog, which makes it all the more frustrating. He only does this when I leave.

I covered my dog's bed in a PVC type material to see if that would help my cat stop peeing on it, but no. Now I flip it up when I go outside with my dog. My dog is newly diagnosed with osteoarthritis and I'm trying to make her as comfortable as possible. It's tough with my cat since she can't really have a comfy bed without the risk of pee. She has some sort of dermatitis on her chest, idk if it's cause pee got on her. I live in an efficiency that's small so I don't have a separate room for my cat. I'm in a bad financial situation right now so until the benefits of getting a better job and hopefully more money after getting my degree kick in, I'm stuck here.

I can't enclose my dog's bed like mine because I want her to have free access. I can find a way to block under my bed but that still leaves access to my dog's bed. Idk if I can somehow get a cage wall to split half the room?

How the hell do I stop my female cat from peeing everywhere??,"Hi everyone.

I've been having this issue with my 2 year old cat for quite some time. She's a british short hair, and really playful. Thing is, she has been peeing literally everywhere other than her toilets. I had to buy a 2nd one and placed them all on very obvious places, still she continues peeing. Up until today, she's peed on the couch, on my shoes, on my parents' shoes, on the chair, you name it.

It all started with her peeing on the couches of the living room. They were quite expensive, so to protect them we've put blankets above them, but even then she has peed on them. Despite us spraying our couches with vinegar, she has not stopped. In a last ditch attempt, we decided to not let her in the living room, but that has made everything worse.

I know, keeping your cat away from you can cause stress to it, but if we don't, then she will ruin all the furniture. Not to mention I spend time with her outside of the living room, so I'm not leaving her alone.

Me and my family have done absolutely everything to stop her from peeing outside her toilet, but haven't succeeded. I know for a fact it's not because she's in heat, because she has shown this behaviour when she was NOT in heat.

Can any one of you help us out? Thanks.",2024-04-05 03:03:18

Despite us spraying our couches with vinegar, she has not stopped. In a last ditch attempt, we decided to not let her in the living room, but that has made everything worse.

I know, keeping your cat away from you can cause stress to it, but if we don't, then she will ruin all the furniture. Not to mention I spend time with her outside of the living room, so I'm not leaving her alone.

Me and my family have done absolutely everything to stop her from peeing outside her toilet, but haven't succeeded. I know for a fact it's not because she's in heat, because she has shown this behaviour when she was NOT in heat.

Can any one of you help us out? Thanks.",2024-04-05 03:03:18
Is our discussion to put down our dog premature?,"We are making a vet appointment for our 13 year old Australian Shepard (mid-size) who was diagnosed with stage 1 kidney failure last year. 

He was always very healthy and it was a big surprise that came up on a dental pre-blood work exam. We've also always given him high quality food because hes always had a sensitive stomach. Diet change and supplements recommended by our vet. 

Recently our relatives (who have known him since puppyhood) watched him over Easter and said he doesn't seem well. Which... made us think more about his condition. He has been slowly deteriorating. 

Concerns are the following:

-For about a month and a half his stomach has been very very bloated. And getting worse.

- He's reluctant to drink water.

-He is now refusing to go to the bathroom unless I force him outside and tell him to. Or asking to go very frequently at odd times. 

-He's more tired than ever before and is sleeping a lot.

-this is just maybe quirky, but he's been a little weird. He's been more reactive recently to like random objects. Almost like he forgot what they were or maybe his eyesight is playing tricks on him. Though I don't see signs of cataracts. 


On the other hand, he is still happy to eat (seriously if he ever loses his appetite I know that means he's really bad off though as he loves food.) Seems happy enough to go on walks, though a little less endurance maybe? 

His situation has become more noticeably bad over the last two months or so. We both don't want to wait too long, because we really don't want his last days to be bad ones.. but is this an overreaction? I don't think it's going to happen right now. But I'm also worried as we have a friends wedding in two months that's out of town. I have not gained any clarity based on the internet archives.

The Importance of Annual Dental Checkups for Cats,"Recently, I brought one of our cats in for a routine dental cleaning, and during the examination, the veterinarian discovered a fractured root that required extraction. Despite diligently brushing our cats' teeth daily, I hadn't noticed any signs of the fracture. When I asked how this could have happened, the vet explained that cats often have dental issues, and fractures can occur without obvious symptoms. It's frightening to think about what could have happened if we hadn't brought her in for a checkup. She showed no outward signs of discomfort and was behaving normally.

So please, if your budget permits, schedule an annual dental checkup for your cats. Detecting dental problems early can prevent costly treatments and ensure your cat's overall health and well-being.",2024-04-05 02:00:33

Face it: spaying and neutering aren't always necessary,"People are literally obsessed with spaying or neutering pets. I know it's necessary when it comes to strays and I'm not against it. The problem is that when you have too many people on Reddit parroting the same old ""They live longer and happier..."" well... how do you know it for sure? Or even Bob Barker going: ""Have your pet spayed or neutered"", as if they didn't have a mind of their own. 

Neutering - obsessed folks even insult whoever doesn't want to castrate or ooperechtomize their pets. Do you think this is fair? 

Many people just sound like: ""Oh, if you don't neuter your pets, they will explode!"" . In Norway, neutering animals such as dogs is even severely limited by laws. Do you think that all pets explode in there? I'm from Europe too anyway. 

I find extremely hypocritical to push spaying and neutering for pets, but being against it in humans. In this damn sex obsessed platform, for example, people think you have a fetish when you think of dating a castrated man. Couldn't it just be because one doesn't want to sexually frustrate their partner? If more people were neutered, it may even have positive outcomes, do you know? Don't start with vasectomies, because you justify it by saying that people have them, but then you go on and say that castration help with ""undesirable behaviours"", so you don't want your pets to be just vasectomized. If you casually talk about your pets having these kinds of surgeries, why are people so offended by the same things in humans? Hypocricy. I don't want to have a horny and sex starved human around either...

I speak as a person who had a spayed cat. She is now gone, but she made me feel much more loved than many people. 

See, the world isn't all black and white: for one last time, I'm not against spaying or neutering domestic animals, because there are too many strays with litters and irresponsible owners out there, but that doesn't mean that every animal should be neutered. Now many of you will start with the cancer or pyometra thing, that's fine, but do that when your pet is at a significant risk. 
Don't insult or assume a person is terrible just because they have intact pets. 

As I often say, it isn't the black sheep that is different. It's the white ones that are all the same each other.

How does one know when it's time to put a pet down?,"We have a 12 year old female shih tzu (Ginger) that we acquired when we purchased our home back in December 2021. The owner of the home and Ginger had passed away and his children were selling the home. When we looked at the home, we fell in love with the elderly and feeble, but adorable and sweet shih tzu that greeted us at the door. We jokingly (but totally seriously) mentioned in our offer letter that if the dog wanted to stay with the house, we would happily take care of her. Sure enough, both children couldn't keep her because they were renting and couldn't have pets so we happily made Ginger a part of our family.

  
She had a history of obesity (weighing 26lbs at one point) and pancreatitis according to her vet records and was on a prescription diet. We got her down to about 15lbs. Last year, she was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma so we've been just doing our best to give her the best last - however long is left - of her life. 

  
Starting in December, her eating habits changed significantly and her back legs started giving out and she would fall down quite often. She went from being the first pet in the house to begin begging for food an hour before dinner time. She would suck down every last bite as soon as it was given to her and then she would go try to hunt down some of the cats' food and sneak a few bites of their food before getting caught. Since December, her interest in food has waned quite a bit. She will eat a bit, then step away and then come back an hour or two later and take some more bites. Instead of finishing her breakfast right away, she would finish it closer to lunch time or sometimes not until dinner time after eating a little bit here and there. Vet prescribed gabapentin and an appetite stimulate to give her as needed.

  
Almost exactly a month ago, she started pooping blood along with very loose poop. We took her to the vet and they gave her antibiotics, some fluids, and some probiotics and eventually she began pooping normally again. 

  
Yesterday, she began pooping blood again and straining to go. She would push like she's trying to poop and a tiny bit of diarrhea would come out along with some blood, then she would take a few more steps and push again and same thing.

  
This morning, I went to work and my wife found Ginger hiding under the bed. She never does that. She has her spots she lays but never under the bed. She has a ""quality-of-life"" check-up today at 2:30pm at her vet to give us an idea on what we need to do. It's hard to know what the right thing to do is because we doubt the vet is going to give us a clear ""her quality if life is poor, she should be put down"" or vice-versa so we're trying to know what the right thing to do for Ginger is. 

  
She doesn't let us know she's in pain. She doesn't whimper or whine, but she gets shivers/shakes, has occasional labored breathing, falls because her back legs give out, grazes instead of eating her food like she used to, is having intermittent GI issues, has a distended abdomen, high liver enzymes, was hiding this morning, etc. On the other hand she hasn't completely stopped eating, she's still drinking water, she still gets up and walks even though she falls, doesn't seem lethargic. Ever since we've had her, she's always been a sleepy dog that doesn't bark or play with toys and just kind of lounges around. She's always been low-energy so it's hard to know if she's lethargic.

  
We worry about her every time something like this happens and my wife loves Ginger so dearly. She's having a very rough time with the thought of this and is so afraid of making the wrong decision for Ginger. She's so overcome with emotions that she can't think straight so I'm trying to do my best to make the right decision for Ginger.

  
How do you guys know when it's time? Is it one of those things like ""when you know, you know"" or is it more nuanced than that? I have been at work today so I haven't observed her with my own eyes today, but when I saw her yesterday, other than the pooping blood, she wasn't behaving differently, but if she's having this GI issue and her other stuff going on, is she suffering but just not letting us see and are we being selfish by keeping her alive?

My cat may have anxiety,"My 11 month old cat has always been very sensitive to sounds. About a month ago he was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, although it is still in the very early stages of the disease and he has already started treatment, minimizing stress in a must. He also absolutely hates to go to the vet.  
Around a week ago the ironing board fell to the ground while he was in the same room, we don't think he was hurt but he was very very scared - understandable. Ever since then he is different. He was always a more recluse cat, but now even more so, he no longer sleeps in our room and spends most of his day in a cave like cat bed. Monday I noticed he had a bald patch near is neck, and we started being more attentive to his stress level.   
He is super attentive and reacts to little sounds. He almost looks a little fearful of us, especially my husband, and often runs away from us, he is even a little more secluded from our other cat, when they have always had a good relationship prior. He is eating and going to the bathroom like normal, but today I noticed that little things like a shoe hitting table seem to make him nervous.   
I'm just a bit cautious of taking him to the vet, since it make in super panicky and we already have to take in to the cardiologist in may, so if possible I'd like to minimize the trips for now.  
What can I do to make him more confident and comfortable? Any tips or experience would be greatly appreciated!",2024-04-04 22:53:14

He is eating and going to the bathroom like normal, but today I noticed that little things like a shoe hitting table seem to make him nervous.   
I'm just a bit cautious of taking him to the vet, since it make in super panicky and we already have to take in to the cardiologist in may, so if possible I'd like to minimize the trips for now.  
What can I do to make him more confident and comfortable? Any tips or experience would be greatly appreciated!",2024-04-04 22:53:14
My cat may have anxiety,"My 11 month old cat has always been very sensitive to sounds. About a month ago he was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, although it is still in the very early stages of the disease and he has already started treatment, minimizing stress in a must. He also absolutely hates to go to the vet.  
Around a week ago the ironing board fell to the ground while he was in the same room, we don't think he was hurt but he was very very scared - understandable. Ever since then he is different. He was always a more recluse cat, but now even more so, he no longer sleeps in our room and spends most of his day in a cave like cat bed. Monday I noticed he had a bald patch near is neck, and we started being more attentive to his stress level.

best way to deal with cat's food?,"my cat is 9 and a half and in the past couple of years has gained quite a bit of weight. we've always fes him whiskas wet + purina dry food, it was usually 2 pouches of wet food a day but nowadays he eats a lot more and my mum feeds him whenever he cries because it's so jarring.

i think we should switch food but I'm not sure what brand is best. im also not sure if we should continue with both wet and dry food. he's an indoor cat and not very active so im not really sure why he is eating so much, but im worried about his weight gain. any advice would be great, thank you.",2024-04-04 22:19:26

is it even worth getting a pet if you never owned one as a kid?,"i've wanted a cat for as long as i can remember. i never did because both of my parents are allergic to dogs and cats while i'm allergic to neither. even when i stopped living with them, i have continually talked myself out of getting a cat because it seems so unbelievably difficult. i have no idea how to catproof my apartment, or what supplies i need, or what to do if it gets sick or runs away. 

i was recently offered an opportunity to foster a two year old cat from a shelter, was all ready to go, and then reached out yesterday and backed out. i felt as though the cat would be better off with an experienced owner who knew what they were doing. but it's created the feedback loop where i have repeated this process for over a decade. so now i have no idea how it's possible for someone to own an animal for the first time if they never did as a kid. i may have to just vicariously live through other people's pets like i already have with the sheer amount that could go wrong.

Dog behaviour help,"Not sure if this is the correct place for this but we are at a bit of a loss.

We have 2 dogs, an Australian cattle dog and a bull arab cross. We've had them for about 5 years and since we got them they have been inseparable. They have had a few scraps but usually once seperated and given time to cool off they come good again and its back to being bestest of buds.

Last night as we were feeding them theyve had another scrap, we seperated them and gave them time to cool off same as we always have. This evening as we went to let them out in the backyard together theyve gone to have another fight.

Is there any help or ideas on what the issue could be? They've been fine in the past",2024-04-04 21:47:16

Diary app for your pet and story time,"Hello! I’m doing a little university research on different diary apps for pets where you can write your and your pet’s memories (with photo and video upload); write about their preferences; set vet, walk or food reminders or even keep a track of his/her body measurements and health. So, I have some questions and I will be very happy to read your answers.  
1.	What pet do you have?  
2.	Do you use a pet diary app? If yes, what is the name of the app and why do you use it? If no, again why?  
3.	What do you want to see or have in a pet diary app?  
4.	What do you think of having an option like “Book a vet appointment” or “Find a vet near me” in the app? That’s a personal idea and here I can give you my own experience as an example: I have had many hamsters (even now I have one) and have seen many conditions, where you can’t do anything for them, even if they are in pain. Because they are little creatures, not many vets specialize in their treatment (or I had problems finding a good one near me in an extreme situation when my pet needed help.) I had a young hamster, which had an allergy to peanuts. Well, I and my family didn’t know about it and fed it first with some. In the first moments, there wasn’t anything wrong but after 15 or so minutes I saw that the hamster was not energized as before and breathing heavily. We couldn’t understand what was going on. Its conditions became worse and we knew we had to go to the vet. So we went to the nearest we found. At first, the vet there said that he couldn’t understand what was wrong with the hamster – he knew only to treat bigger animals. After that, he started to ask us about things that we had done before coming here. And only then did he realize that the hamster had an allergy. It needed medications but because the vet didn’t treat hamsters he didn’t have anything in his room. And so my hamster was fed with medication for birds, that could help. Well, it doesn’t… Now I am thinking about it again and wondering if I had that option, it could help probably. But because that is only my opinion, I want to know what you are thinking too.  
  
If you have some personal stories, similar to mine, and don’t want to share them here, you can always DM me :). Stay pawsitive and shower your pets with love.

New cat keeps trying to fight old cat,"I’ve had my older cat for 6 years, he’s very laid back. Recently we got another cat, he’s about 5 months old and he keeps trying to fight my older cat. I keep them separate but they do cross paths, I can’t really avoid that as I live in an apartment and have no spare bedroom. 

Anyway, my older cat isn’t aggressive and he usually just chills but the new one keeps finding him and it begins with meows and maybe some hissing. The moment the older cat turns away from him, the younger one will try to attack. 

Now the older cat seems a bit spooked. I can’t get him out of my room and if I do, he just finds another space to go and hide in. It’s stressing me out and I don’t know what to do. 

Any advice will be helpful! Thanks in advance. ",2024-04-04 19:06:47

My vet was concerned about his teeth but said he was in picture perfect health and if all goes well he’ll probably live to 20. All that stress and tears thinking it was his time!,2024-04-04 19:06:45

I don't think we should take my fiances cat with us when we move,"My fiance has had his Russian blue for about 10 years, since he was about 13. His name is Gandalf. This cat has dermatitis and gets sick easily. They grew up together is a house full of people and other cats. 

My fiance and I are about to be moving into our first home together. We have 3 cats all together, including his. The other 2 cats have been moved around with me and are younger cats, I'm not worried about them with the move. Gandalf just has a certain personality that makes me worry about changing his life so much. I'm concerned about us taking Gandalf with us though. I don't want to take him from his home away from the other cats and people. My fiance is upset about this because he promised gandalf that he'd never leave him. My fiances attachment to gandalf (and AHDH) is making him fixate on the fact that he made a promise and not the reasons i stressed to him. Now, if we don't take him with us, of coarse he'll stay at my fiances families house, where he's always lived. 

Here's my list of reasons:
Gandalf gets depressed
When he gets depressed he won't eat
We learned that new situations, getting depressed, and not eating all effects his dermatitis
I don't want to take him from everything he's ever known and been around
He's an older cat
I don't want his home instinct to kick in

Gandalfs just all around a sensitive cat and I don't want to disturb his health by moving him away. I just don't know how to wrap my fiances mind around this. Am I being too much? What are some things I can say to my fiance to help him process all this? How can I comfort my him?",2024-04-04 17:41:29

Lost a member of the family ,"Hello, I come to you a little broken hearted. I’ve lost my best friend of almost 14 years. It happened all of a sudden, and I didn’t get much time to properly show him just how important he was. I’ve been dealing with some health issues, a new baby just arrived, and I’ve been trying to balance work/life with an almost 3 year old daughter that demands dad’s attention. In all of this, I lost sight of my baby boy kitty, and I didn’t realize the direness of his illness.

To start this story, I had just gotten back from Iraq, and there were a lot of things that were weighing heavy on me. Among those were my father, who ended up in a coma while I was deployed. I made it back home from deployment, and quickly married someone who had been a close childhood friend, and I thought would be a good safe person to marry. I moved out of the barracks, and got myself a  rescue kitty off of Craigslist.

My dad passed before my son was born. When I called to tell him it was a boy, I was told he had just passed. My marriage didn’t go well. I think we both had a lot of issues, jumped in way too fast, and it wasn’t healthy. After getting out of the military I moved back home, where we decided to try 50/50 custody. It didn’t go well, either. She ended up just keeping him, and said I had to get the courts to say she had to give him back. I went almost 2 months without seeing my son while I secured a lawyer and had her served. She called out of the blue before our court date and said I could see him, I assumed her lawyer said she should. The catch is I had to drive a motorcycle I had just gotten (my dad’s who passed, and was waiting for me at home), and learned how to ride, hours away to see him. By the end of that night I was in jail, facing 3 felonies, her word against mine. I never should’ve gone into her trap, but I couldn’t resist the chance to see my son.

In the background of all this, is this little kitty, who loved me so much. I’ve never seen or had a cat like this. He was completely loyal to me, and we shared a very special bond. He always wanted to just sit on my lap, and would stay there until I had to get up. He was a selfless kitty, truly a one of a kind. We moved from state to state, and city to city.

My son is almost 13 years old, and I haven’t been able to tuck him in bed in almost 12 years. I carried that cat around like a baby for a long time while I coped with not having my son, and he was my emotional support animal. Now that my kitty is gone, the pain of not having my son still hurts worse. I get supervised visitations with him, and I never miss one, but it’s only for a few hours twice a month. I’m so lost without my kitty, he was a son to me, and I can’t believe how drastically his health declined in 24 hours. All the emotions he helped me overcome have all come back.

I love my wife, we’ve been together 10 years, and we just had our second baby girl. I’m so over the moon, they are so amazing.

I’ve been in pain from some health issues, and really stressed from all the changes going on. I caught my kitty stealing chicken nuggets off of my daughter’s plate, and he’s gotten away with it a few times. He has pancreatitis, and can’t eat grain foods. When I caught him I lost my cool and spanked him, in my mind it was for his own good. I would never spank my kids, I don’t know why I thought it was appropriate to spank him. He went and jumped on his window perch bed, and immediately feeling bad, I went and apologized until he let me pet him again. That was a month ago, and he was seemingly fine afterwards.

Now my daughter was just born, and it has been a whirlwind. Luckily family came to the house during this time, and they were there to love on and care for my kitty. My sister-in-law came up to stay while we were gone, and my kitty loves her a lot. When we got back from the hospital, which was late at night, I opened a can of wet food so we could all celebrate the new baby. I called for my kitty, and I heard him jump down, but it took him too long to get to the door. He came and sat by the plate, but my kitty didn’t eat, and both his back legs didn’t seem to be working well. I took him to the vet first thing the next morning. They did X-Rays, ultrasound, and bloodwork. The vet said he couldn’t see anything physically wrong with him, but that his heart appeared to have an abnormal shape. His machine just wasn’t good enough to really see why. He said this could correlate to the legs not working well, but it didn’t exactly register to me why.

I took my kitty home that night, and scheduled an appointment for another doctor who had a better machine to scan his heart in 2 days. I was so exhausted, my wife went into labor as I was going to bed, and in days later I had still barely slept. I laid down to sleep finally, and as I was laying there I heard my kitty call out in pain. I got up to lay with my kitty, but soon after my wife needed me with the baby. By the time I made it back, he couldn’t lift his head any more. I stayed by his side awhile longer, and he passed while I was petting him. Grief overcame me, and I’ve been openly crying for 2 days now. My daughter keeps asking me when we are going to pick him up from the doctor, and it’s killing me inside. So is knowing that I spanked him, I’m so disappointed in myself.

The doctor says he believes it was a blood clot caused by a heart issue, and that usually the animal gets put down if that’s what they find. I’m beating myself up thinking I should’ve done more, stricken with guilt over having spanked him, and praying the two aren’t connected.

Thanks for letting me vent, any help is appreciated. I should be so happy with the new baby, but I can’t stop crying over my son (kitty). I’m still doing my best to help, I’m just sobbing while I do it.",2024-04-04 15:42:36
Lost a member of the family ,"Hello, I come to you a little broken hearted. I’ve lost my best friend of almost 14 years. It happened all of a sudden, and I didn’t get much time to properly show him just how important he was. I’ve been dealing with some health issues, a new baby just arrived, and I’ve been trying to balance work/life with an almost 3 year old daughter that demands dad’s attention. In all of this, I lost sight of my baby boy kitty, and I didn’t realize the direness of his illness.

To start this story, I had just gotten back from Iraq, and there were a lot of things that were weighing heavy on me. Among those were my father, who ended up in a coma while I was deployed. I made it back home from deployment, and quickly married someone who had been a close childhood friend, and I thought would be a good safe person to marry. I moved out of the barracks, and got myself a  rescue kitty off of Craigslist.

My dad passed before my son was born. When I called to tell him it was a boy, I was told he had just passed. My marriage didn’t go well. I think we both had a lot of issues, jumped in way too fast, and it wasn’t healthy. After getting out of the military I moved back home, where we decided to try 50/50 custody. It didn’t go well, either. She ended up just keeping him, and said I had to get the courts to say she had to give him back. I went almost 2 months without seeing my son while I secured a lawyer and had her served.

I'm about to move into an apartment and I don't know if I should take my dog.,"First of all I want to clarify that this dog is mine, I adopted him since he was a puppy. My family loves him, but I'm the one who takes charge.  
My dog is 14 years old, all his life he has lived in a house with a large garden, my parents' house.  
I'm going to become independent and I'm thinking about whether to take him with me or not, he is very attached to me and when I'm not at home he gets depressed and no one takes him out for a walk.  
But I'm not sure what will affect him more: moving from a house to an apartment, probably spending several hours alone, but walking every day, or living without me but still in his usual home whit his huge garden, where he can sunbathe, run after the pigeons, bark at people passing by, run from one side to the other and everything that entertains him. but with no one to take him for his daily walk.

Can anyone in Chicago rescue him? (Urgent! // TW Sad) ,"
Hi all,

This incident happened yesterday and I am posting this right after having left the store (on 4/3).

I was running errands and the nearest pet store to my location at the time was a PetSmart. I noticed that they had a very unwell (depressed and absolutely beside himself) and despondent chinchilla. 

I asked the associate who is in charge of his care if he is sick or if something had recently happened to him that he could be acting in that way. The employee (regretfully) let me know that the he had paired and bonded with his brother whom he was kept with until yesterday. 

His brother had somehow gotten stuck under a piece of wood in the small cage they are kept in and had suffocated and died in front of him. They still had this poor baby in the same (dirty, inhumane, and inadequate) cage where his brother had just died and it looked to me like they hadn’t even cleaned it out.

I couldn’t bare to leave him there but I am going out of town and wouldn’t be able to get him until next week at the absolute earliest.  

I am reaching out to see if there is anyone who can save him from that place. It is the PetSmart at 2665 N Elston Ave, 60647.

I have never seen a chinchilla cry before and I hope that someone who loves and is knowledgeable in how to PROPERLY care for chinchillas sees this. 

Please feel free to pass this on! 🤍 ",2024-04-04 08:07:39

I have never seen a chinchilla cry before and I hope that someone who loves and is knowledgeable in how to PROPERLY care for chinchillas sees this. 

Please feel free to pass this on! 🤍 ",2024-04-04 08:07:39
My cat is driving me to the point of insanity,"My cat, M/10mos, will NOT stop fucking with his water dishes. 

A little backstory, we got our kitten Miso back in August at 3 months old. Our first water dish was a plastic, self filling water dish with a basin on top (think office water dispensers). His favorite thing to do was hook his claws under the lip of the dish to play with it, i.e. dragging it so it slashes, tipping it over. I got tired of wasting water and having to clean it up every 30 minutes, so we switched to a plug in electric filtered fountain, thinking it was flush with the floor, no problem then right? 

Wrong. 

The fountain we got him had a tray that sat inside of a groove on top of the water basin, and sure enough, almost immediately he was messing with it. dragging it by the cord, flipping the tray off and spilling water all over the floor. We tried sticky tape around the sides, and that didn't work either. So we thought, alright, different fountain. We bought a new wireless fountain, that instead of having a tray just sitting on top, the lid had a M to F fit with the basin, no lip to pop off. Surely this would do it. 

It did, for a couple weeks. When we first got it, he spent HOURS trying to figure out how he could ruin our days with it. We laughed because at this point, he just couldn't find a way. Until he did. He will now hook his claws into the seam where the lid goes into the basin, and tip it, spilling water all over the floor. It's constant at this point and we can rarely just hang out in the house without reprimanding him every 10 seconds (seriously, it's nonstop). 

Ive even tried moving his food away from his bowl, since I learned cats may deem their water ""dirty"" if it is too close to the food. 

He lives a very active lifestyle, we play with him constantly, but are currently looking for another cat to keep him occupied. We know this may just be either attention seeking/boredom, even though he gets plenty, and i mean plenty of playtime and attention. 

Is there anything more I can do to stop this behavior? Are there any wireless fountains on the market that are TRULY unspillable? I'm talking suction cup bottoms, latches to hold the lid in place, 100% fuck proof. Indestructible. My cat is insane and if there's a way to spill it, he will. 

sincerely, 

a cat mom who at this point will never know relaxation again",2024-04-04 06:21:03

Why Does my Dog Hate My BF but Only When We're at Home?,"I have a 16 year old male dachshund who has never been highly social and has always been fairly reactive, but never with the people he lives with. I was recently told by our vet that he has arthritis and is beginning to become senile which might make him more sensitive and aggressive, but I've noticed it's mostly aimed at my boyfriend who he previously adored. 

He seems to remember me, my family, and their pets just fine. He's okay with my bf's mom who he barely knows, but when we're at the house, he barks, snarls, and snaps at my bf any time he comes near him. I don't suspect abuse as I'm with my dog 24/7 (work from home) and my bf is never alone with the dog (he's also the gentlest person I've ever known). When we travel, he suddenly becomes best friends with my bf again, even willing to sleep in bed with us (something he stopped doing at home recently). 

What could be causing this behavior? ",2024-04-04 05:59:36

Heat stroke or poison?,"Help please, I live in a tropical country (Philippines) and it's really hot here always. My 3 and a half year old dog (mix of american bully and shih tzuh) who had just given birth to 4 puppies a week ago just finished eating her dinner and went back to her puppies in their whelping cage, they were doing their routine (drinking milk from mama dog and mama dog licking their butt and private parts to get them to poop and pee) then i noticed that one of the puppies just pooped, I got wet wipes then when I was about to pick the poop up and clean it mama dog ate poop, then after about 10 seconds mama dog vomited then I noticed that mama dog's eyes and behavior weren't normal, her eyes looked like she saw a ghost and then she got disoriented, her head started spinning around and then she collapsed, she was out of it for about 5-10 mins (i immediately put a soaked towel under her and started wetting her neck and body and head I was careful enough not to put water where it would fall down on her nose causing her to inhale it and drown, I also tried calling an emergency vet after doing this) then after a few mins she started waking up but she wasn't normal at all like I could just tell, it was like she got possessed or something. She wasn't panting, she wasn't responding when I tried to call her name, and then after 5 mins again I offered her water and she drank but still disoriented and unresponsive based on my observation. There is an electric fan pointed right at their whelping cage and I always give her fresh water because It really is hot here. This has never happened before not even during afternoon where it is the hottest. It happened at night at around 8pm. Could it have been a heat stroke or she got poisoned or ingested parasite or anything harmful from the puppy's poop? (puppy's a week old) Please reply anyone. Thank you!",2024-04-04 04:01:47

I’m at my wits end atm because it’s now gotten to the point she’s waking me up at 2:30am😅😅 any advice would be much appreciated!!!!!",2024-04-04 02:30:30

Dog under eating Royal canin,"So my dog was seen for possible pancreatitis, enteritis or IBD- the ultrasound looked fine, but she was having vomiting/diarrhea. (Waiting for appointment with specialist)  They changed her food to Royal canin low fat canned, they said she can have up to 1 and 1/4 can a day, at 18lbs. She doesn’t even eat a full can a day. Maybe 2/3? She will eat her food and stop, I guess when she gets full. She is still on zofran, Cerenia and flagyl at the moment. I just worry about her under-eating. Anyone else have this problem starting canned food? She used to eat 1/4c twice a day of an air dried food, Sundays. ",2024-04-04 01:58:33

"roommate's dog keeps destroying my stuff, should i ask them to pay for damages?","my roommate's dog keeps destroying my stuff and I need advice on whether i should ask them to pay for the damage or not.

i work from home most days while roommate is in the office for 10-hour shifts, and the dog stays home with me occasionally. the dog is a large breed only 6 months old and is currently being crate trained, but he cries all day and it drives me nuts so i keep him out with me while working.

He first destroyed a $150 pair of my prescription glasses and my roommate offered to pay, but I didn't let them because i feel like it's on me for not putting the glasses in a puppy-proof location and i didn't want my roommate to feel bad. since then, he has destroyed my FAVORITE leather purse that I wear every day, my favorite bra, and my tennis shoes that i wear every day. I make an effort to not leave ANY of my stuff in the common areas and always keep my bedroom and bathroom doors closed, but of course i'm not perfect, and the few times i have forgotten, he has destroyed these items.

what should i do? how can i bring this up in a fair way? i feel that my roommate would feel bad and offer to pay for the damages, but i also want to be mindful that i am responsible for keeping my items safe... i'm torn and don't want these issues to snowball!!

SECOND EDIT: I’ve had puppies before, obviously I’m keeping my eyes on him and using all the tips/tricks to keep him stimulated (he’s also, ahem, not my dog) please hold the advice on how to deal with puppies, I’m asking for perspective from fellow pet owners on how you would handle your dog ruining your roommate’s stuff. 

EDIT ON CRATE TRAINING:
he’s not in a crate all day every day and my roommate often takes him to work actually! Really only for a couple hours max whenever the house is empty, which only happens a couple times a week. He is happy and loved and learning and growing and while crate training is not my style, it works best for my roommate’s needs and I respect that!! We have great communication on his care so far and I am not letting him out when I’m not supposed to. Seeking advice more on how to handle my damaged items!",2024-04-04 01:52:27

Nursing an infant rat,"Hello, 

Today I found a baby rat, it's house was completely demolished and the mother was gone. I have transported it in a plastic container with paper towels and cotton pads.

 I just bought a big rat cage, wood snips, hemp for in the house and everything necessary. She is in her first box inside of the cage and can walk out on floor level. I have put kitten food, water and kitten milk out for the rat on undeep plates. The cage is in a dark private room with an electric radiator heating up the room.

The rat has it eyes open and has grey smooth fur, but it doesn't move much. It is however moving cotton pads that I have put in it's box. I am guessing it's around 2/3 weeks old based on how it looks like. I believe it is approx. 7 cm. 

I have tried to feed the rat with a pipet, but it didn't try to drink the kitten formula. It hasn't eaten or drinken for 7 hours now. Also, I haven't seen any droppings or pee, however I am not sure about jt because I don't want to dig in the box and disturb the rat.

The rat has peace from me and could walk to the kitten food and formula. It is laying in th box and moving around cotton pads and paper towels to hide itself.

Is the rat already able to poop and pee by itself around this age?

Do I need to keep trying to feed the rat?

Should I just leave it alone and let it get used to the situation instead of feeding and stimulation for pooping and peeing?

I have no picture, but if you guys need it to help me better I could make it. I just want to disturb the rat as little as possible.

!!!Please help with suggestions, I am feeling lost!!!

I had to put my dog down,"My 8 year old dog had diabetes and had gone blind. We were proactive and was giving him insulin on a schedule. He seemed healthy otherwise. It was around 11:00 pm when he started having seizures and I rushed him to the only emergency vet in our state( luckily only 45 minutes away). He had three bad seizures on the way. When I waked in they told me all the vets had just gone into surgery and they couldn’t see him for 6 hours. I knew he wasn’t going to make it. I took him back home and my wife held him all the while he kept seizing. We could both tell he was neurologically gone. So I called the local police , not 911, I knew he needed to be put down. I just needed to know if there was a place I could humanely put him down without the town hearing the gunshot. The police were so understanding, two officers came and reminded me of a place a few miles out of town where I could go. I know I did the right thing for Winston. And I know I did the right thing for my wife in not talking about what I did. But I haven’t really talked about what I did and it weighs pretty heavy on me. To the point I have times now that I just shut down and leave the room to be by myself. This was 5 months ago and I’m not sure if the healthy thing is to talk to my wife about it, she still gets very emotional about Winston, or just grieve when I’m alone.",2024-04-04 01:32:06

Feeling like a bad pet parent(despite things not being my fauly),"So I legitimately JUST got home with my cat from the vet, so I'm sorry if this is a little confusing, I'm very upset, and really need to vent.

She has severe gingivitis, which I was given antibiotics to give her, and she has a dry cyst behind her ear.

CONTEXT:
In 2021, my mom adopted 3 cats from the Pet Smart in my city. Our pet smart goes through the local humane society to get their cats for adoption. 
Mona(now my cat) was estimated by the human Society to be roughly 9 months old. They had spayed her recently before her adoption, so they told us to keep an eye on it.
Since 2021, Mona has not been to a vet. She's been living in my moms basement with 2 other cats, not getting the proper TLC she needed. She was well fed, but she is a very loving, borderline clingy, so she wasn't getting the love and attention she craved. 

THE STORY:
In September 2023, my boyfriend and I decided we wanted a pet. My mom said I could choose any of her cats, and I picked Mona. I had grown a special bond with her, as whenever I visited, I would always spend the bulk of my time with the cats in the basement, giving them attention.

Since then, I've been pushing and pushing to take her to the vet, but I couldn't afford it until last month. I booked her an appointment, and took her in today.

She has severe gingivitis and is missing her front teeth. She has her canines, but her little front teeth are missing. And the vet says, based on her teeth, she's 5 years old.

I broke down to the vet asking if the gingivitis and missing teeth could've happened in the last 6 months and if there was anything I could've done, and he told me that, due to the severity, she's had it for quite a while, long before I took her home with me, and her teeth have been gone for at least a year based on the healing.

This has left me feeling very angry and frustrated with my mother, because now I'm seeing how much more she cares about her dogs then she does about her cats. Yes, they're indoor only, but she still needs to be taking them for checkups and making sure they're healthy. Obviously, now I know she isn't.

ENDING:
Thank you if you've read this far. I have her antibiotics and I will be following the vets orders 100%. 

EDIT*** forgot to mention the vet said I was taking very good care of her cyst, and to just keep up with the cleaning routine and it should disappear.

TL;DR: took my cat to the vet, found out my moms neglect towards her cats, made me feel like a bad pet parent due to my cats health.",2024-04-04 00:20:05

She has severe gingivitis, which I was given antibiotics to give her, and she has a dry cyst behind her ear.

CONTEXT:
In 2021, my mom adopted 3 cats from the Pet Smart in my city. Our pet smart goes through the local humane society to get their cats for adoption. 
Mona(now my cat) was estimated by the human Society to be roughly 9 months old. They had spayed her recently before her adoption, so they told us to keep an eye on it.
Since 2021, Mona has not been to a vet. She's been living in my moms basement with 2 other cats, not getting the proper TLC she needed. She was well fed, but she is a very loving, borderline clingy, so she wasn't getting the love and attention she craved. 

THE STORY:
In September 2023, my boyfriend and I decided we wanted a pet. My mom said I could choose any of her cats, and I picked Mona. I had grown a special bond with her, as whenever I visited, I would always spend the bulk of my time with the cats in the basement, giving them attention.

Since then, I've been pushing and pushing to take her to the vet, but I couldn't afford it until last month. I booked her an appointment, and took her in today.

She has severe gingivitis and is missing her front teeth. She has her canines, but her little front teeth are missing. And the vet says, based on her teeth, she's 5 years old.

I broke down to the vet asking if the gingivitis and missing teeth could've happened in the last 6 months and if there was anything I could've done, and he told me that, due to the severity, she's had it for quite a while, long before I took her home with me, and her teeth have been gone for at least a year based on the healing.

This has left me feeling very angry and frustrated with my mother, because now I'm seeing how much more she cares about her dogs then she does about her cats. Yes, they're indoor only, but she still needs to be taking them for checkups and making sure they're healthy. Obviously, now I know she isn't.

ENDING:
Thank you if you've read this far. I have her antibiotics and I will be following the vets orders 100%. 

EDIT*** forgot to mention the vet said I was taking very good care of her cyst, and to just keep up with the cleaning routine and it should disappear.

TL;DR: took my cat to the vet, found out my moms neglect towards her cats, made me feel like a bad pet parent due to my cats health.",2024-04-04 00:20:05

The Allergic pet from a Vet's POV and helping owners understand the process.,">Disclaimer: I've mentioned some products and brands here just because I use them regularly in my work. Nothing has been received for their references in this article.

*This is a simplified step-by-step guide to help dog owners understand the steps towards allergy diagnosis and management. Unless the logic behind the steps are communicated properly by the vet, I understand that the process may appear slow, frustrating and not always clear. It is important to keep a good dialogue with the vet throughout the process and not to expect a quick-fix after the first consultation.*

*Also note that each case is handled differently based on many factors such as the owner's financial limitations, country-specific norms and the veterinarians habits and experiences. Please note that this is just an example on how I myself approach allergic dogs. Other veterinarians may have completely different routines that works for them.*

**Common presentation:**

Allergies typically begin to develop in dogs between the ages of 1 and 3 years old and usually present with one or more of the following symptoms:

* Itching and/or skin redness.
* Licking of legs and paws.
* Recurrent ear issues.
* Anal gland issues/butt scooping.
* Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and gas.

There are plenty of differential diagnoses for each of these symptoms. For the sake of simplicity we must assume other conditions have already been ruled out, otherwise I would probably have to write a small book.

**1: Anti-Parasitic treatment**

Even if I strongly suspect allergies, I usually always start out an allergy consultations by ruling out parasitic infestations. A skin scraping can be performed and investigated under the microscope, but a negative skin scrape does not rule out parasites; it only rules out parasites at that small patch of skin where the sample was taken. It's a simple and cheap treatment, so if the issue happens to be parasitic it will save the owner a lot of time and money. If the symptoms are severe, I provide anti-itching drugs for a few days while the trial anti-parasitic treatment has time to work.

(Hypothyroidism can also cause allergy-like symptoms and should be ruled out (blood test) before initiating a full allergy investigation.)

**2: Hypoallergenic diet trial:**

If the symptoms are still present after anti-parasitic treatment course, I start the dog on a prescription Allergy diet for 8 weeks. We use Royal Canin Anallergenic since it's the most extensively hydrolyzed diet available. Hydrolyzed diets contain proteins that have been chemically 'chopped' into tiny subunits, so small that the pet's immune system cannot recognize them as allergens. Since they are not recognized by the immune system they will elicit no allergic reactions. During the food trial it is important that the dog ONLY eats the prescribed diet and avoids everything else, including treats and human foods. If the dog is severely affected I will provide anti-itching medicines for a few weeks at the start of the food trial, but it is important that the medicines do not mask the effect of the food change for us to know what actually worked.

If the symptoms disappear after the 8 week allergy trial diet, then great, we may conclude that food is the cause of the pet's allergies. I will then usually do elimination diets to figure out what types of food the dog actually tolerates. Some dogs may have to remain on prescription allergy diets for the rest of their lives. Some vets perform a food challenge test (Back to the diet they reacted on previously) after symptoms have cleared to check for recurrence as a way to confirm their diagnosis.

FOOD ALLERGY BLOOD TEST: These tests are somewhat controversial as they are NOT tools for diagnosis or identifying specific food allergens. However, they can be useful during a food trial in determining what protein sources the dog is less likely to have an allergic reaction to.

**3. Environmental allergy screening + trial treatment.**

If the allergy symptoms are still present after 8 weeks of prescription allergy diet, the cause of the allergy is more likely to be environmental (or both). At this point I usually recommend doing a blood test screening or panel against specific environmental allergens, such as pollen or mites. I always offer to do the blood test during step 2, but many clients prefer to go stepwise.

While waiting for the blood results I usually initiate treatment with Cytopoint injections. Depending on the severity I might add Apoquel short term for relief as it is very quick-acting and effective drug. For very severe cases corticosteroids might be required. I prefer Cytopoint for long term use over Apoquel and (especially) glucocorticoids due to having a more specific mechanism of action, while the alternatives are more broad-acting immuno-suppressive drugs. However, each patient responds differently - Finding the ideal treatment is usually a case of trial and error and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Sometimes a combination is required.

*NOTE: Neither Cytopoint or Apoquel cure allergies. They provide relief to the pet by blocking some of the symptom's pathways. However they are still very important medicines for improving the quality of lives for thousands of pets with allergies.*

*\* Cytopoint: Injections lasting 4-8 weeks.*

*\* Apoquel: Daily tablet or chewable.*

**4. IMMUNOTHERAPY:**

Immunotherapy is the closest we currently get to 'curing' environmental allergies. Please note that immunotherapy has nothing to do with food allergies which can only be managed nutrionally.

The results from the blood panel previously mentioned can be used to create a custom solution containing the most important allergens specific to the dog. The solution is injected or given orally in gradually increasing concentrations. This procedure desensitizes the immune system to said allergens, alleviating the symptoms over time.

It is worth noting that approximately 50% of patients will respond excellent to immunotherapy treatment, 25% will have good response, and 25% will not respond at all. Immunotherapy is no immediate relief and it may take months before any effect is observed. Concurrent treatment is usually necessary for symptom relief. Glucocorticoids should not be administered during immunotherapy as it will considerably decrease the success rate.

**Additional (environmental) allergy management tips:**

* Regular baths: For pets with environmental allergies, regular washing will remove allergens from the fur and may alleviate symptoms. Bedding, blankets etc in daily use should also be cleaned regularly.
* Allergen-neutralizing spray (such as Allergone): These products bind to proteins inactivating their effectiveness as allergens, preventing them from becoming airborne indoors and making them easier to clean. Allergone can be sprayed anywhere (beds, couches, blankets, carpets etc.) and is long lasting.
* Symptom Tracking: For seasonal allergies, symptom tracking can be very valuable. If you learn what months of the year the allergy starts, treatment can be initiated beforehand as a preventive measure. Preventing seasonal flair-ups will potentially save you veterinary expenses and your pet a lot of suffering.
* Symptoms, seasonality and medicine response can change over time and therapy adjustments may be necessary as time progresses. The quality of treatment (and the dog's quality of life) is dependent on good communication between You as the owner and the Vet. If the current treatment proves ineffective, don't wait until a full flares up before you reach out. Be observant and on the ball.",2024-04-03 23:50:32

Has anyone ever had a vet do a payment plan?,"I'm not asking because I need one or for any reason specific to my situation. I just always see people recommending others ask when in a tight financial spot, but in my experience it just isn't an option.

Other vets have always been pay in full at the time service is rendered. My mom ended up in other vet offices asking for payment plans/bills/etc and was always denied.

Edit: I want to reiterate that this isn't about me or anything I'm dealing with, my vet bills are handled 😅 I'm just genuinely curious.",2024-04-03 23:13:51
how do u prevwnt dogs from getting sick?,"i recently lost my 1 year old shih tzu due to blood parasite. i still have 2 pups at home, i immediately got them tested and thankfully they're negative.

i am just so scared to lose another again. how can i keep them healthy? are there any essential vitamins that i need? or should i add something to their food? tia",2024-04-03 22:46:01

Changing pet insurance? ,"I’m looking for new pet insurance because Healthy Paws keeps increasing the monthly cost like every 3 months now and it’s well over $100.

Best pet insurance for dachshunds?,"I'm wanting to get insurance for our puppy.

Anyone have suggestions for the best insurance that for sure covers IVDD (if it pops up, she doesn’t have it) and any other known dachshund genetic issues on their main plan? I know that she seems healthy now, but want to make sure that anything that could pop up in the future is covered. Hoping for 90 percent covered. 

I would especially like to hear from those that have actually used the insurance and they paid easily. My husband’s job offers Nationwide but it only covers 50 or 70 percent, I’ve heard conflicting reports on if it covers IVDD from posts on here and seems higher than most.  Thanks!",2024-04-03 21:49:08

Puppy has fractured leg needs surgery we can’t afford,"
hey everyone, I’m brand new to Reddit I have no idea what I’m doing so bear with me, I want to give the whole story for the best understanding of the situation. 
We have frenchie puppy who is 6 months (ish) and he fractured his leg in two spots, however the fracture is going down the bone and not horizontal so they can’t just put him in a cast to let it heal. Not to mention he’s a puppy with a LOT of energy it is already a struggle to get him not to walk on it as it is. Anyways to the point, he has been taken to get X-rays and everything was done he was sent home with pain killers and a light sedative that alone was about $600, to then find out we need to schedule him for surgery ASAP with that total coming out to about $6000. 
Now, we have applied for all kinds of financial institution loans, tried with the bank, unfortunately we don’t qualify because I’m only 20 and have no credit and my mom was in a situation with her ex husband and let’s just say her credit score isn’t great now. Pet insurance won’t work because now this is a “pre-existing occurrence” and with that it still comes out of pocket first and that’s not doable for my family right now. So I’m looking for any advice anyone might have on what to do for financial aid in this situation if anyone else has been in a spot like this anything helps. 

Side note: please no hate on the whole “if you can’t afford a pet you shouldn’t have one” because we can afford HIM we can afford a check up vet bill we can afford the things a frenchie specifically needs. He is our family we are willing to do what it takes we just need a real option.

If you have any questions I’ll answer the best I can, seriously any advice helps thank you. :))

Edit: we have already tried care credit and didn’t qualify or get approved",2024-04-03 21:41:01

My senior dog needs a tooth extracted with a referral to a dental specialist. I can't afford it. I don't know what to do.,"So, very long story short: My senior dog (17 in two weeks) has finally seen his age catch up to him. He was diagnosed with stage 2 kidney disease in mid-November, followed by cushing's disease in early January. He also has worsening arthritis, which recently has been very well managed with adequan and gabapentin. He also has a history of canine periodontal disease in part due to a past history of seizures that initially prevented vets from being willing to clean his teeth.

I've spent thousands of dollars on him in recent months between frequent vet visits and blood work. Two weeks ago, he spent 48 hours at the emergency vet relieving fluids after his kidney values spiked. They are thankfully back down and he is now considered stage 1. Everything was going fine until Monday night, when he began to bleed briefly from his mouth. Started again Tuesday. got him into vet. Determined it's his tooth. Bleeding picked up again late at night and so I took him to the emergency vet, where they determined the tooth would need to be distracted.

His vet says due to him being a small dog (prone to broken jaws with certain extractions), his age, and his various health issues, he would need to go to a dental specialist to have the tooth removed. I cannot afford this. I am at a loss as for what to do, and I hate even considering that this may be the time to say goodbye, but I can't afford another large expense and I know that even if I could, it would only be a matter of time before another health issue arose, likely with his kidneys, that would result in yet another large expense.

Edit for anyone wondering: The vet called and was extremely supportive and understanding. She acknowledged that given his age and other health issues, there is a decent risk to anesthesia. She recommended that given my concerns, the risks, and the fact that my boy is currently eating and drinking fine and otherwise acting ok, we hold off on making the decision. She is still sending a referral to a vet dental specialist, where there would be two anesthesiologists in the room during the procedure, that way I can call them with any questions about it and they can sort of get things in order for if/when I decide to move forwards with the procedure. But for now, we're keeping him comfortable on pain meds and antibiotics and monitoring him. I'm currently planning on giving him a few really good last days before saying goodbye.",2024-04-03 19:52:09

cat missing for months. please help.,"it feels awful to have her gone for so long, and i feel like i’m too late in coming here for advice and that scares me. my 12 year old calico/tortie went missing went i was staying with family after losing my apartment, just a few weeks before i was able to get my current place of residence. 

i currently live only a few miles from where she ran away from, and i’ve looked around for ages both day and night. i have put up posters as a constant, and slowly spread them out in areas she might’ve reached. 

i’m also chronically ill and have mobility issues, so i’ve had a few gap days where i wasn’t able to look in depth, but i also still take quite frequent drives to our old house and where i was staying after that and i haven’t seen her. 

she’s healthy, and was raised as an indoor/outdoor cat with experience near wooded areas (against my wishes). she is my childhood cat, and i’ve had her since i was 9/10. she’s fixed and vaccinated, but not chipped. has lived in cities nearby most of her life, but this was her first time in this one. she is very friendly, playful, and active. she avoids busy streets and large intersections because she’s scared of cars and loud noises. 

she means the absolute world to me and i’ve genuinely been so depressed without her here and i just don’t know what i’m supposed to do without her. i absolutely refuse to give up hope that she’ll come home, but i’m so scared she left because she hated me for our situation. it’s been a little over 8 months and i honestly just lay here and cry most days.

i have a trap cage and some clothes of mine to put in it as well as a blanket of mine to put near/on to help keep her warm- i just don’t know where to put it and i’ve waited all throughout the winter because i was scared she’d get stuck in the snow or rain storms for a while before i could get to her, but i feel so horrible for wasting time looking. 

i’ve joined social media groups, especially shelter/sanctuary, lost pets, found pets, etc. i’ve called around and gone in person and nothing. i haven’t gotten any messages on sightings since around a month after she left, and it was to say they spotted her a week before reaching out a few blocks away from where she originally ran but it seems like they haven’t seen her since.

British Shorthair advice,"So I have a pretty good chance of getting an apartment next year and would love to have two British Shorthairs however I just want to make sure that getting two of those cats would also be good for the cats themselves and that I'm able to properly take care of them and providing them what they need.

So I decided to ask around here because I honestly have a few questions, so I can be as informed as possible.

Would it even be smart for me to get two cats despite having a full-time job and living in an apartment? 

Do any of you know decent resources on British Shorthairs and on how to take care of them properly and possible common medical issues with British Shorthairs? (I found a few on Google, but I just want to make sure the information I get is accurate)

I'm sorry if this post is kinda dumb, but I just want to be informed as best as possible.",2024-04-03 14:58:15

Dog whining in my car and don’t know why.,"Hello Reddit!! I have a question that whenever I’m in a car driving, for example a family member, my dog always starts to whine in the back seat and we don’t know why. At first I thought it was because edge just wanted our attention. But even though we gave her lots of attention while driving she still kept whining. Then I though she was just anxious because of the new scenery outside that she’s never before seen but I also think that she thinks she’s forever going away from home. Idk just something I think about but I’m just asking why does she do this? Is this common among dogs? If so does it happen to yours? Just curious because she’s always been doing this.

2 cats or 1 dog and 1 cat?,"Hello, I live in a house and I have a dog that is 14 years old, I had a cat but she passed away.
Now, I want pets to companion my dog.
The question is if I have 2 cats, the probability of them going away of my house will be lower?
Is there any way to keep them inside the house for safety? Or trained them only to go certain distance away?
It would be better to have a dog and a cat? If the cat adopts behavior of the dog, will stay inside the house?
Which is a better match to not being preoccupied that something would happen in the outside? 😭😭😭😔 please, I need advice. Thanks to all.",2024-04-03 12:22:01

Dog bite broke skin . What do I need to be concerned about?,"As I was on a walk tonight, a random dog (I don't know the owner) got out of the yard and bit my calf. The bite broke skin but did not tear through my jeans. I got home about an hour later and spent a few minutes washing the area with soap, used an alcohol towelette and rubbed antibiotic cream on the bite. 

I'm assuming the dog was up to date on vaccinations but would rather be safe than sorry. I tried calling the humane society to see if I could confirm the dog's vaccination status through the owner's address but had to jump through a bunch of hoops and was unsuccessful. I brushed off the incident and figured the wound would heal in a week or so but others around me told me I needed to go to urgent care ASAP. I will be getting the bite checked out tomorrow morning. Anything I need to be seriously worried about? Rabies, bacteria, etc?",2024-04-03 10:00:05

Dog pees in my room,My dog recently started drinking more water and noticed has been peeing in my room a lot more but only in my room. I noticed he was about to pee on top of a pile of clothes I had but I quickly opened the door to my living room so he could pee but he ate some food first and then peed outside. Later I found out he already peed on my pile of clothes today. Is he doing it on purpose for attention? Or he really can’t hold it? Or is he just getting old? He’s 13 years old and a chihuahua. Thanks everyone ,2024-04-03 09:45:45

Adopting my first cat!!,"Hello, I am adopting my first cat & would love any advice or pointers!

"How do I move out with my ""family"" pets?","I am going to be moving out of my family's house in about 2 years & I'm planning to do this secretly, if I can. Part of the reason I want this to be secret is because I want to take my 2 cats with me when I move.

My cats would not be safe living in my family's house, if I were not here. If I were not here, my mom would take over for the cats. The issue is that she does not feed them properly, she over-feeds them and buys them crappy food. She doesn't clean their litter boxes, I have to do this for them. We live in our grandmother's house & our grandma does not like the cats and often leaves our oldest cat in the garage on purpose. She's said over and over that she wants to get rid of them. Our uncle & aunt both live on the property as well, and have a pack of wild dogs hoarding around their house & the dogs are known to have killed several cats in the neighborhood. So if my grandmother ever felt like it, she could just open the door & let the dogs solve her problem for her. I am the main caretaker of these animals, I bring them to their vet appointments, keep them vaccinated, clean their litter boxes, etc.

This has to be kept a secret because for one, I can't have anybody knowing I'm moving in the first place because my family is toxic. And 2nd, I know for certain they will say no to me taking the cats & get pissed at any reason I give them for why I should have them.

TL;DR -- So with context out of the way, I am wondering what others have done in a situation where they need to get their pets out of a home secretly. I kind of (?) know what to do to cover my ass legally, I do plan on getting micro-chips & licensure to show that I am the legal owner of these cats. I mainly just want to avoid the drama while in the middle of moving because moving is stressful enough as is.",2024-04-03 05:31:15

Experience with Perineal Urethrostomy procedure?,"My 5 y/o male cat unfortunately had a second blockage (in 5 months), even though he is on a strict urinary special diet. He’s been at the vets with a catheter since sunday and is doing good. He’s going to have perineal urethrostomy done this thursday, to hopefully avoid more blockages in the future. Reason for the PU surgery is, that he had the previous stones removed by surgery back in November, and if we do that again, chances are they’ll just return in 5 months and we don’t want him to go through that again.
Is there anything I need to be aware of when he gets home to recover?  Last time he recovered really well and fast, but this is obviously different. ",2024-04-03 04:20:55

Pet insurance for dermatologist?,"Hey everyone, 
Quick question, I’m thinking about getting pet insurance, but don’t know if my future appointments with a dog dermatologist would be covered? Anyone know?

They recently referred my German shepherd to a dermatologist, and I already know it’s going to cost an arm and a leg, and so was wondering if insurance would cover that? Because technically he’s had his skin issue for some time now, and the vet has done everything they know to treat the issue but nothings working, and so they’ve now referred us to a specialist. If the insurance does cover visits like this, I would be switching out of my vets plan to this insurance company’s plan.

Advice on our seniors last vacation ,"We are taking our annual trip to Yosemite the end of this month. We go every year with our four rescue dogs and it’s some of the happiest times I’ve seen them. We stop at tons of different places to sightsee and play along the way to our destination, where they run, swim, hike and get to eat lots of fantastic special camp steak dinners.

This year is particularly special to me though, because our oldest dog is turning 18. She has cancer and some masses we can’t remove with surgery due to her age. On top of that, her stability and back legs are starting to give out after short walks. Our vets have been working with us keeping her comfortable until she tells us it’s time. She is cleared for the trip and part of me feels this may be the last time we get to experience this beautiful place with her. We will not be doing as many long or physical activities to accommodate and are trying to prepare so everyone is comfortable and content. 

I am asking for advice on equipment, camp tools, set ups and just general knowledge to make this as smooth and easy for her as possible. 

I would like to know if anyone has a good recommendation for an all terrain dog stroller? 

I’m also wondering if anyone has any “hacks” for making camping more comfortable for her? We’re thinking maybe a small pool float or bed and her own children’s sleeping bag? 

Any random little bits of knowledge that any other pet owners have or learned from having a senior dog would be greatly appreciated! 

I should mention all our dogs are on the smaller side, near 15-20lbs ",2024-04-03 02:51:52
Advice on our seniors last vacation ,"We are taking our annual trip to Yosemite the end of this month. We go every year with our four rescue dogs and it’s some of the happiest times I’ve seen them. We stop at tons of different places to sightsee and play along the way to our destination, where they run, swim, hike and get to eat lots of fantastic special camp steak dinners.

"As a Kid, my Father gave away or sold just about every pet that me and my siblings had. He himself had all kinds of Pets as a child. Why did he do this? ","I recently had a realisation that just about every single pet I had as a child, my dad gave it away. I don’t think I realised at the time but looking back, it was quite traumatic to get attached and then they just disappear and I never got a real explanation as to what happened to them. Just “We don’t need these animals so I got rid”. 

 I would come home from school and they would just be gone each time. Whether it was My cat, my small turtles, rabbits, Guinea pigs, our old family dog, etc. Obviously, this was over the course of my childhood, not all at once. My Dad is gone now so I can’t question him about it, but I wish I had.

 I don’t hold a grudge against him because I will always love my father, all is said and done & I know he did his best apart from this. I moved out at about 18, and one of the first things I did after getting my own place with my girlfriend was to get the same type of Dog I had as a child that was given away. 

What I’m asking the community is, why would he do this though? Did anyone else experience something similar as a child?

 He had countless animals himself as a kid - monkeys, cows, chickens, dogs, cats, parrots, you name it. Why didn’t he let his kids enjoy like he did? Was his heart broken by the loss of an Animal that he didn’t tell us about, and then he didn’t want us or him to feel that pain again after getting attached to a pet? I think about this quite often. This might not be the most relevant sub for this post, but I don’t really know where else to post it.

Just to be clear I’m not looking for sympathy, way worse shit happens to people in life - just looking for some ideas or potential explanations as to why. I guess it’s a search for a little bit of closure.

"For those who had their dog's teeth cleaned with a referral to a board certified veterinary dental specialist, how much did it cost?","Hi all! My senior dog is having some dental issues (has for years, but has had issues that prevented cleanings), and there is a possibility he may need to have his teeth cleaned and extracted. Due to a combination of his age (17 next month), health history (including CKD), and him being a small breed dog, the vet said they would refer us to a veterinary dental specialist at the university's vet medical center.

Worms/fleas ,"Hello everyone. I’m in need of advice/help. First pet owner here so please bare with me. I took lulu ( 3 month old ragdoll) to the vet for a reminder/vaccine and the vet suggested to give her a dewormer and told me that she should be getting one every month up to 6 months, which I already knew and I was taking her to another vet prior but had to change because I don’t trust him tbh ( he was billing me double the normal fee I’m in casa but knew that as a foreigner I might not know the fees and gave her a flea treatment that was literally toxic ) he told me he gave her a dewormer last month but he probably did not. My current vet is great though. 

Anyway, today I found « rice » looking yellow stuff all over her couch I touched them and they were hard, I knew I was going to regret touching them once I look them up lol. According to other posts I’ve seen they’re tapeworms? I contacted my vet immediately, and he said it just means that the dewormer is working and she needs another one in two weeks. I told him that I also found a flea in her furr this morning so he told me to bring her in tomorrow for a flea treatment. She’s never done one with this vet before so hopefully it will be good. He didn’t really answer all of my questions and I had many. 

This is when I turn to you guys, how do I proceed? First of all, I kiss lulu a lot ( not near her mouth but her furr) she’s my little baby I can’t resist lol. she also bites my hands a lot and sometimes I don’t clean them before grabbing a snack cuz if I clean my hands everytime my cat bites me I willl be cleaning my hands at least 20 times a day. I also let her on my bed even though she doesn’t sleep with me at night but she naps on my bed during the day. I only change my sheets once a week. The doctor didn’t warn me not to let her on my bed after the deworming treatment he actually told me I should start letting her sleep with me. But now he’s telling me to avoid letting her on my bed after contacting him today. What I want to know is If there’s a risk that I caught some of these parasites that she seems to be carrying? Also I would like to know if this is normal after deworming or is it not? I checked her bedding again and along with the sesame looking stuff I also found what appeared to be dead white larvae I’m not too sure. Now should I keep her away from my room ? I feel really bad. Is this normal or do I need to change vets for the third time? Do I need to clean her room is there a change of her catching this stuff again because of the exposure to this stuff or do I wait until I’m sure the deworming is done and clean it all at once? Should I avoid touching her? And do I need to change vets for the third time. 😭 please help any clarification/ steps of what I need to do from now would be really HELPFUL. ",2024-04-03 01:11:51

Need help preparing my cat for big changes and adjustments (moving and having a baby)!,"I need tips on helping my cat adjust to many significant changes simultaneously. Skip to the end if you don't want to read the backstory!

*Backstory:*

My and my boyfriend's cat, Olaf, has lived with us at my boyfriend's grandparent's house for the past two years. But we recently left because his grandparents are very toxic. We're staying with my family, but Olaf is still at the other house. We tried to bring him with us, but my family already has a cat, and she attacked Olaf on the first night. She is old and very skittish and territorial, and I don't want to make this harder for either cat by bringing him here. I also don’t want to confide him to one room when he is used to having an entire house and the outdoors. 

My boyfriend still goes to his grandparent's house daily to see Olaf. But I have decided I don't want to be around his grandparents anymore (specifically his narcissistic grandmother). Which means I can't see Olaf. It's been a month and a half, and I miss him so much. I worry that he thinks I'm dead. We're very close to him. He slept with us every night, and we have a bond with him like no other. We have spoiled him so much, and he was on a schedule that worked for him. He was just so happy and living his best life. Fast forward to now, my boyfriend's papaw said he spends many nights walking around the house, meowing and looking for us. I feel horrible.

*Skip here if you don't want to read the backstory!!*

We're searching for an apartment and have found one we believe will work out. But I'm worried our cat will have difficulty adjusting to this change. We will be living in an entirely different place than he is used to. He also won't be able to go outside at our new apartment, but in the previous living situation, he could go outside and inside as he pleased. He also uses the bathroom outside but will strictly use the litter box once we move. Also, I'm pregnant, and we have a baby on the way. Only 19 more weeks to go! I’m worried that the stress from being in an entirely new place and adjusting to an entire new human will be really hard on Olaf.

I truly believe his connection to us will outweigh the scaries of this new situation. But I need some tips on making adjustment for him easier and less scary. I've done some research, but I need help finding information regarding our specific situation.",2024-04-02 23:57:39

Need help preparing my cat for big changes and adjustments (moving and having a baby)!,"I need tips on helping my cat adjust to many significant changes simultaneously. Skip to the end if you don't want to read the backstory!

*Backstory:*

My and my boyfriend's cat, Olaf, has lived with us at my boyfriend's grandparent's house for the past two years. But we recently left because his grandparents are very toxic. We're staying with my family, but Olaf is still at the other house. We tried to bring him with us, but my family already has a cat, and she attacked Olaf on the first night. She is old and very skittish and territorial, and I don't want to make this harder for either cat by bringing him here. I also don’t want to confide him to one room when he is used to having an entire house and the outdoors. 

My boyfriend still goes to his grandparent's house daily to see Olaf. But I have decided I don't want to be around his grandparents anymore (specifically his narcissistic grandmother). Which means I can't see Olaf. It's been a month and a half, and I miss him so much. I worry that he thinks I'm dead. We're very close to him. He slept with us every night, and we have a bond with him like no other. We have spoiled him so much, and he was on a schedule that worked for him. He was just so happy and living his best life. Fast forward to now, my boyfriend's papaw said he spends many nights walking around the house, meowing and looking for us. I feel horrible.

*Skip here if you don't want to read the backstory!!*

We're searching for an apartment and have found one we believe will work out. But I'm worried our cat will have difficulty adjusting to this change. We will be living in an entirely different place than he is used to. He also won't be able to go outside at our new apartment, but in the previous living situation, he could go outside and inside as he pleased. He also uses the bathroom outside but will strictly use the litter box once we move. Also, I'm pregnant, and we have a baby on the way. Only 19 more weeks to go! I’m worried that the stress from being in an entirely new place and adjusting to an entire new human will be really hard on Olaf.

I truly believe his connection to us will outweigh the scaries of this new situation. But I need some tips on making adjustment for him easier and less scary. I've done some research, but I need help finding information regarding our specific situation.",2024-04-02 23:57:39

Tips for Introducing an Extremely Skittish Cat,"I adopted a little calico yesterday from a home where I was told she was being bullied by other cats. I was told that she was found as a stray originally and was friendly and more outgoing until the bullying started. She came out to see me when I came to pick her up and sat on her previous owner's lap. She looked over her shoulder a lot, which led me to believe that it was true that she was just scared of the other cats but was friendly with humans.

I assumed that when I brought her to my home, it might be a better environment for her as I currently own one other female cat who is sort of anxious too, but sweet and friendly with people and other cats after a short intro period. I work from home and spend a ton of time at home. I thought my low-key, shy cat would be a good fit for her and they might help each other come out of their shells a bit. My cat was an only for 6 years until I moved in with my ex, and she enjoyed playing with his cat every day. She seemed bored by herself again.

I brought the calico home last night and put her in the bathroom. She was SO SMELLY as she came from an unkempt home with 7 other cats so I had to give her a quick bath and check for any fleas. I thought the best thing would be to get all the traumatic experiences out of the way at once. She took the bath pretty well, and I set up her own new litter box in the bathroom and left her alone with a small amount of wet food and water.

She hasn't touched the food at all or even come close to it while I was watching and hasn't used the litter box yet. She's loafed herself up as tiny as possible behind the toilet and whenever we have to use it or flush it, she tries her best to become even tinier. She cried a bit in the middle of the night and stopped when I came over to see her and talk to her softly. If I pet her, she allows it but doesn't respond in any way.

I've been a lifelong cat parent, but I've never seen such a nervous cat before. She is nearly paralyzed with fear behind that toilet and I feel so sad for her. What do I do? I am willing to be as patient as needed, but I want to see her at least eat and drink and use the litter box...its been about 12 hours.

1 - How do I get her to eat/drink/use the litter box? I know she is hungry/thirsty and probably needs to pee/poop.

2- How do I introduce her to my cat considering her past trauma with cats? I allowed my cat to look at her and my cat stared, growled and then went away. I know from past experience my cat will likely pap her a few times before making friends and I'm worried about how that might affect her. ",2024-04-02 21:49:48

What are some mythologies you’ve created about your pet through the years?,"Here are some for my dog:

1. She is the manager at my city’s Container Store but she is terrible at organizing and uses her job to launder money. Unknown who/what the money laundering is for.

2. She does not like watching reality dating shows like The Bachelor. She went through a divorce before she moved in with me and it bums her out to watch people be insincere about love.

3. She was hired by haircare company, DevaCurl, to create video content for their YouTube channel. DC paid her $50,000 and she took the money and made zero content. She was sued for fraud but the two parties reached a settlement. Documents are sealed and I will never know the details of the settlement.

If you knew her this would all sound 100% believable just based on her personality 🤷🏻‍♀️",2024-04-02 13:57:42

Three-year-old adoptee cat doesn't seem to like me!," I've been searching for the last 3 or 4 months for a cat. About 5 weeks ago, I picked up a 3-year-old long-haired female cat who was unhappy in an old home and the owner was stating that she was unhappy with all the recent new pets in the house (couple about to get married), and was pretty grumpy. In the 5 weeks I've owned her, in the last 2 weeks, she was starting to come out during the evening before I went to bed and even in the morning before the sun came up. She would even troll around me as I sat on the couch. At one point she even came up to me as I tried to offer her a treat -- she didn't take it. She comes out at night and trolls all over the house, and plays in my guest bedroom with her felt balls, and other items the previous owner gave me. This past Monday, I had some guests take the bedroom for one evening, and since then I just haven't seen her at all, and she's now not eating as well as she was for the first 4 weeks.

  
At one point a few nights ago, before going to bed she must have ventured into my bedroom, unknown to me and she ran into the shower. I tried to sit there and communicate with her, but she was growling at me despite my efforts to be friendly with her. She wasn't having it, so I just left, and she scurried back under the couch at some point.

  
Sometimes during the evening when I'm sleeping, I can see her sitting in the hallway outside my bedroom, she's easy to pick out having dark hair against my white tile floors and wall. I even heard her meow a few times last night, so I have no clue as to what's going on with this cat. It's been probably 20 years since another cat I owned and that cat was just chill - always. Was the best cat I had ever owned.  
My neighbor has both a male and female cat and they both love me, just not sure what's up with this cat. At this point, I'm sure you can imagine I'm feeling quite a bit let down in that I was looking for a companion. I'm 55 and I work from home and have a lot of time to be friendly towards a pet. Sunday the 31st will mark 5 weeks since I've picked her up.

  
Looking back on when I got her, after speaking with the owners, they took me into the room she was in, already in a pet travel container, of course she was scared, I'm sure but I had no actual time with the cat outside of the traveler, so I'm curious if that caused issues. Quite honestly I'm even wondering if this cat wants anything to do with me at this point.",2024-04-02 12:49:51

Bil Jac ,So I tested this new dog food and all my dogs seemed to love it. Two weeks later and one of my dogs has thrown up clear/yellow bile twice in two days. Is this because the brand dissolves in liquid quickly? Should I mix it with a kibble that doesn’t? Has anyone else experienced this or gone through with this brand before? ,2024-04-02 12:00:30

Neighbors most likely abandoned one of their dogs.,"Neighbor's Rottweiler has been barking constantly for the past 3 days. Was thinking he was abandoned as this morning I went to check on him. He's locked outside in their backyard. No food or water. I tried to feed him but he would just growl and snap at me. Left the food near the fence on their side but he won't eat it. I periodically check on him. He just sits by the garage door. It's raining and I'm trying to guide him under the trampoline in their yard so he could be out of the rain at least. Just ignores me and keeps barking at me. Tried to see if someone was home. Didn't get an answer. Gonna wait and see if someone shows up tonight or next morning. If not, I'm going to call animal control. I really dislike the dog cuz he tried to attack me, my brother, my sister, and my mother a couple of times but my compassion for animals looks past all of that. I hate seeing animals suffer.

Update 1: Checked on the neighbor's dog periodically throughout the night. Basically every time I woke up. No one showed up. Is currently 8:41 in the morning and still no one. Called for a wellness  check.

Update 2: Cops did a wellness check. No one was home and they called Animal Control to come get the dog. Hope the dog is going somewhere safe and he gets fed and some well needed rest.",2024-04-02 07:30:53

Transitting Through Canada with Cat,"Hi all,

I'm moving from UK back to the US in May, and am planning on flying Air Canada in order to bring my cat with me in cabin and avoid having him in cargo. The flights all have layovers in Canada, so I'm trying to figure out the exact documentation I need.

I see that for entry into the US, I will need his up-to-date rabies vaccine and health certificate. I plan on getting that from a UK veterinarian.

I'm a bit confused about what I need for the transit through Canada. I believe the rabies vaccine + health certificate will be enough for his entry into Canada, but I'm reading the fine details about what is needed to leave Canada [here](https://inspection.canada.ca/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/exports/pets/united-states-of-america/eng/1475065583538/1475065648302), and it seems like they need documents from a Canadian vet. I'm assuming for the case of transiting through Canada, that the UK vet's documents will suffice, but I just want to make sure that there's nothing else I'm missing?

If anyone has experienced/dealt with this exact situation, your help would be appreciated!

Cat has started spraying,"This is a long post because I want to fully describe what's going on. I initially posted in r/anxietyhelp just because it's causing such a terrible reaction in me, but now I want to specifically ask about my cat.

My ten year old, neutered cat developed an issue with ""spraying"" (kind of) many years ago when I was not in control of my environment and my mom dumped a bunch of new cats into the home who didn't get along with him or really each other. He would do the vertical motion, but essentially urinate rather than spray. Like it was a large quantity and took a while to get out. I used to suspect he maybe didn't know how to ""really"" spray because he started so late in life. He wasn't the only cat spraying. Our house ended up smelling like piss, my cat developed FIC and at one point needed a stone removed. I know at one point he was on kitty prozac but I remember so little about that time of my life I don't recall if it helped at all or why I stopped giving it. Essentially he started doing the ""spraying"" when he was having urinary/bladder problems, but just continued to do it, as far as I can tell, out of habit.

About a year ago now, I moved into a new home with my now spouse. We're so happy here, we put money into updating things and making it to our liking, and we intend to stay here forever. We brought my three cats, including the previous problem boy (and none of the ones my mom dumped on me,) and my dog. All was well. He wasn't spraying, everyone seemed happy, life was good.

Recently, he's started spraying. Like actually spraying. No more large quantities of urine, just spritzes, usually right next to the litterboxes. This has set off a massive wave of anxiety in me. I'll be taking him to the vet, he's due for a wellness check anyway, but I fear this is behavioral and will just be ""the new normal"" yet again, and my beautiful forever home will be ruined like the last one.

I adore him and want what's best for him. I'm using nature's miracle to clean up the spray, scooping the boxes daily, and spraying feliway around where he's sprayed. I also ordered a feliway diffuser refill. I changed to a different kind of litter before I noticed him doing this (not that he wasn't necessarily doing it before I noticed) so I grabbed his old brand today and changed out one of the litterboxes with it. When I get paid I'll probably buy more and change out the rest. I hate to waste the other litter but that's a small cost if this is what set him off. I'm praying that he'll stop once he has his litter back, but I am so afraid and so panicked. I genuinely feel sick over it. I just can't express how it makes me feel to think this will be my life again.

So here are some questions:

What is the outlook for fixing this? Like I said, he hasn't done anything like this for over a year as far as I know, and what he's doing now is different from what he was doing at our last home. In terms of quantity of urine and, so far at least, frequency. He doesn't do it as often, and isn't producing as much urine when he does.

Can feliway really work for these instances? Did it work for you?

Is nature's miracle the best in terms of enzymatic pet cleaners? Are there things you'd recommend?

I had hoped to put off the vet visit until I get paid at the end of the week, but if something is wrong I don't want to wait and have him hurting, so I'll be taking him in Wednesday (it is currently Monday evening) as it's the only time my schedule aligns with the vet's. What sort of tests should I expect them to want to run and what is the average-ish cost? (I know that will vary quite a bit depending on a lot of factors)

I guess I'm kind of seeking reassurance in an extremely frightening time for me. I genuinely feel like I can see my dreams crumbling in front of me. You can see why I posted in an anxiety sub first. I want him to be happy but I'm so afraid this is going to be out of my control and I'll have a fucking piss house again.",2024-04-02 06:48:04

I’ll be sharing responsibility with my boyfriend of 1 year. The issue is I can’t take her home with me as my family has an older cat (M16) and my father refuses to let me bring her home in fear of stressing our cat out. I understand that and respect it so I’m trying to find out what to do. 

My boyfriend at first said she could stay with him but backtracked because he will be working during the summer or might be going on a trip. I know the right thing to do is say no to the foster owner and just wait for a better time but this cat just speaks to me and I feel so much love everytime I look at her. So if anyone has any ideas on what to do, any boarding places they’d suggest, or just advice I’d love to hear it. ",2024-04-02 06:47:10

Advice to keep confined cat happy & healthy,"Me and me cat just moved into a new house where one of the housemates is allergic to cats, so they've asked me to keep my cat and all of her things in my room. Doing this for even just half a day broke my heart because she is an indoor/outdoor cat and she used to be able to run around, climb, and jump, and now she is suffering a lot, not being able to move.

She cannot go outdoors here, it is not a safe area.

She is usually very quiet but last night she was so insufferable that she even woke me up meowing asking me to play in the middle of the night. I played with her for 5-10 min and then I had to fall back asleep. I’m really sorry for her.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can keep my cat active within my room? I feel like we are jailed here.",2024-04-02 05:35:03

Debate in my family as to whether we should neuter our family dog,"Some reasons why we should: 

1) The obvious one: Birth control

2) Behavioral benefits: dogs that are not fixed can be more aggressive 

3) Health benefits: less risk of cancer/other health complications 

4) Convenience: doggy day care spaces only accept fixed dogs 

&#x200B;

Some counter-arguments:

1) Low risk of reproduction given that he is the only pet in the house and he is always on a leash when walking

2) He is a very non-aggressive Chihuahua, people are always surprised at how sweet he is. He has never gotten into fights with other males, intact or not, if anything he gets scared if any dog barks at him. He also has never attempted to hump a female. He is very well trained, learns commands quickly (very food motivated), and has a very gentle personality.     

3) This is a good point, but he is young (2.5yr) so risk of cancer is extremely low for his age. When he is older and is at risk we would revisit this conversation. 

4) We prefer not to use doggy day care. We are a large family and we all love him so we figured can always find someone that would be willing to take care of him if necessary. 

&#x200B;

Other arguments against: 

\- The procedure required him to go under which always has some risk, especially for such a small dog. We prefer not to run the risk for the moment as it does not seem necessary.

Is it time to put my dog down?,"I am sorry if this topic/discussion is not allowed, I am just very lost on what to do...

My dog, Kobe, is a 15 year old Shiba Inu. In the last year or 2, he has significantly deteriorated from his former self and definitely has some sort of dementia or canine cognitive dysfunction.

He has not been eating as much, but he does still eat on his own time. He sleeps 90% of the day and has trouble getting up, especially his back legs, which sometimes just give up. He also walks with a hunch on his back. We think he's blind in one eye, and the other one is probably semi-blind. His hearing is probably gone too, or he's just ignoring our calls... He often walks in tight circles or circles around the kitchen continuously in the dead of night for hours. He sometimes loses balance and cannot stand up fully (his back leg sliding) while he eats/drinks. He refuses to go out for walks anymore, and if/when we do bring him out to do his business, he will aggressively hold his ground in any direction we want to go and refuse to move. He doesn't really like to be touched anymore, except for a few specific spots, and will bark/try to bite if you do something he hates (i.e. touching his paws). Lately. he's been pooping a lot at home, sometimes normal, but a few times with really bad diarrhea. He's in diapers at all times now cause he often pees in his sleep or when he gets up from his long sleep. We did a checkup on him 2 months ago, and his blood work all came back normal.

I don't know if anything I have listed is fairly normal for an old dog, but typing it all out here makes me see that Kobe-now is not really my Kobe anymore. Deep down, I probably know the answer to my own question/dilemma, but I really don't know how to move forward and would like some reassurance or guidance.

Seeing him still have so much energy in holding his ground or his aggressiveness makes me think he still has some life/fight in him. The recent check-up results also don't help me see that it's time for him to go yet. If he's in pain, I would put him down without hesitation, but I know dogs don't really show pain like we do. I read a lot of other posts on this, and I know I am probably keeping him around for my own selfish reasons; I am keeping him alive for me and not for him. But I keep asking myself, who am I to get to play god and determine if he gets to live or die? I don't know if I am strong enough to make the call or even pick up the phone to schedule his death.

My other 14 year old Maltese just suddenly left us back in August, and I guess it's so hard to make this decision when I am still healing from that wound. I am just so lost, and I don't want to lose another family...

Sorry for the rant. Please help guide me in the right direction.",2024-04-02 05:04:48

Would Cocanut Oil Help Treat Acral Lick Dermatitis,"I have a 12 year old blind Chihuahua named Rocky. Rocky likes to regularly be groomed, bathed, brushed. We call it his spa day. 

However, we got kicked out of my mom's last June because of her psychological issues and I haven't been around a tub or a tub substitute to give him a bath. Plus, since living with my grandma, her cat likes to sneak up on Rocky and start beating him in his face just to scare him. Sometimes he will even hide in the corner or lay down in Rocky's pathways to wait for him to beat him. I think Payton is causing Rocky anxiety. Then Rocky licks his arms because he's anxious. 

My aunt and grandma have noticed his arms and my aunt is a very holistic person. She thinks I should put coconut oil on his arms. I would rather give him a bath first because he has oatmeal shampoo. But I don't want to be yelled at for not giving him coconut oil. I often get yelled at for not taking advice when I know it doesn't actually help. 

Does the coconut oil actually help though? Has anyone used it for Acral Lick Dermatitis before? 

I just want my little tough cookie to feel better. He already has to deal with a collapsed trachea. And I don't have the money to blow on a vet. I do have a little bit of vet experience, at least enough to do a basic examination, and I don't see any infections or cuts. 

We do move into our own apartment soon. Then it'll just be me, Rocky, and my 3 year old Chihuahua, Eevee. Rocky also tries to lick Eevee's ears like how he licks his arms. Is that also Acral Lick Dermatitis?

Moving to London from USA with Cat,"Hi, everyone!

I am moving to London for grad school in September and am planning on bringing my cat with me. I am currently trying to figure out the best way to travel with her and get to London. From everything I've seen, there is no way to fly an animal into the UK in cabin. I am PETERIFIED of having her in cargo in case something happens. I am absolutely terrified of her being lost, hurt, or god forbid killed, in cargo.

Is it better/safer to have a shorter, more direct flight with her in cargo, where I can pick her up at the animal reception center at Heathrow or to have a (much) longer trip, with multiple stops/travel types, but she is with me the entire time. 

Specifically: 

Is it better to fly non-stop (approx. 9-10hours, leaving from TX arriving at Heathrow) with her in cargo?

Or is it better to have a flight with layovers, fly into Paris, then taking an pet taxi to London so she can stay in cabin with me? This would take a lot longer, but she would be with me the whole time. 

She is 12 years old and HATES travelling in the car. I also worry about flying out from Texas in September, since it is usually still very hot (85-105 degrees Fahrenheit). Any advice is welcome, especially from people who have made the trip from USA-UK with animals before. 

Thank you!!",2024-04-02 03:19:24

Thank you!!",2024-04-02 03:19:24
How do you feel about Petsmart and Petco soliciting donations during their checkout process?,"Many for profit businesses will solicit donations through their point of sale system for limited time periods, but the two largest pet supply chains always ask about donations for their nonprofit foundations during their credit card checkout process.  What do you think about that?

Kitten tracking liter everywhere after I take her outside but freaks out when I try to clean her feet. Help?,"Like the title says, I've been taking my 5 month old kitten outside on a harness almost every morning lately. We mostly just walk around my yard, but she seems to always get sticky stuff on her feet. Almost every time we come back inside she uses the bathroom immediately and comes out of the liter box with tons of liter all clumped to her feet. 

I got a liter mat and it helps some, but I started trying to check her feet when we get back inside and wipe them off if they seem dirty. I've tried using a slightly damp shammy thinking it being soft would help but she absolutely hates it. I tried putting a tiny bit of water on a plate and setting her on it so that she cleans her own feet after they get slightly wet and she hates it. 

She hissed at me for the first time yesterday when I was gently wiping her feet off. I've tried giving her treats during and after, and she'll snap out of fussing for a second but then goes right back to it. She doesn't normally have an issue with water, she has jumped into the shower with me a number of times and constantly gets her feet wet in the tub when there is residual water.

She knows the harness means we're going outside now and will purr when I'm putting it on her. I was hoping she could get used to the feet cleaning as a part of going outside but it's the only thing I've had issues with her about. Any help or input would be appreciated!  ",2024-04-02 01:57:11

2-month-old Puppy with an almost 1-year-old Cat,"Literally just got the puppy yesterday. First interaction of me holding the puppy with my cat carefully approaching it, she hissed once she got close and then ran away as she seemed spooked by the puppy. She used to roam freely and when we call her would usually come, but all of that now is carefully done, which really breaks my heart. We have the puppy within a cage-pen downstairs as our cat's safe space, feeding area, and litter box is all upstairs. Thing is, when the puppy obviously howls throughout the night, the cat hides away. Thankfully, the cat just used the litter box fine this morning, but the thing about the litter box is that it's at the top of the stairs out in the open. And when the puppy does howl, our cat hides. I'm worried when she does get the chance to use the litter box that she HOPEFULLY won't get spooked during her ""moment"" and hopefully still be able to use her litter box. Yes, I could technically move her litter box, but I mean I honestly wish not to move it as it's the best spot that I won't be able to smell anything from where I work as I WFH. Plus, as said, she did use it fine this morning. Also, broke my heart last night that the second I picked up my cat last night, she would moan and whine, which she obviously never did... I'm guessing she gets spooked with the smell of the puppy on myself?

I get that this will take time, but I'm wondering if anyone else also had all this same exact problem, but then it later on got better? It's a really tiny puppy and I prayed while driving home that our cat would get along with it... I don't think I could even pick up my cat like once a day and go towards the puppy's pen, as she'll get rowdy. I guess is the best way probably just leave my cat be as hopefully she'll go downstairs time-to-time and smell/check the puppy out? Not sure if my cat will ever go downstairs, because whenever the puppy howls whether it be from it's own separation anxiety or wanting to play, my cat will immediately hide away somewhere, and it'll be usually behind my bedframe... What are some best practices that ya'll have done?

&#x200B;

Also to note: My cat has never hissed in my near to 1-year of taking care of her. So this is definitely new as she is ever rarely spooked at anything other than obviously sudden movement/noises.",2024-04-01 22:20:35

Help me identify this thing on my dog's leg,"Can someone help me identify this black and round bulb looking thing on my dog's leg? At first I thought it was a tick but it seems so fleshy and I don't really see any legs or where a head would be.

I went to pick at it and it seemed like my dog didn't appreciate that as if it was her own flesh I was picking at. If I take her to the vet theyre going to charge me $80 minimum, even to tell me everything is fine. Just want some more input before doing anything more about this.

Question about my 7 month old Golden Doodle. ,"Bella (the mom) was having troubles during the birth, had 12 2 were still born. Remi (my pup) was the runt of the liter, and was extremely cold when born. Wouldn’t move much with weird breathing too. Me and my fiancé kept this one for ourselves when they were ready. Remi is super close with me and is about me non stop. Is there anyway she would know that I helped her through when she was born? Or “saved her” so to say? Maybe that’s why she is so close to me? Tia, may be stupid to think that it’s possible. Just wanted to see what everyone else though. ",2024-04-01 21:17:46

How to get rid of fleas,"Hello,
My cat used to have fleas bites on her neck that I could feel by touching. I brought her to the vet, they applied an ointment to her and gave me a topical to treat her neck.
Today is a week after I took her to the vet, I applied the topical to her neck everyday. I also  vaccumed and mopped the floor everyday.
Now there's no fleas on her neck anymore. However, they started migrating to other parts of her body. There aren't alot but I'm afraid that they will reproduce there. Is this worth worrying? Also how can I know when it's safe to vacuum and mop less regularly? There're lots of stuffs in my house so it's tiring to vacuum and mop everyday.

Roommate’s cat (m) likes to play rough with my cat (f),"Both cats are about 2 years old, my female cat is a few months older. He is larger and heavier, but she is no shrinking violet. Mealtimes, late at night, and early in the morning are the most common times for fights. She is the one making all the noise, from growling to yowling. She also whacks him in the nose, sometimes making him bleed. It’s obvious from the little tufts of fur about that they both mean business and it’s not just fun. 
It was her house per se, then the roommate and he moved in. Sometimes, they play nicely, chasing each other back and forth. When either is isolated in a bedroom, the other paws at the door to get to them. 

We have two litter boxes, two water stations, and separate them at feeding time (she eats on the counter, he is on the floor, same room).

The pheromone diffuser does not seem to have an effect, though it’s been less than a week in action. 

The roommate does play roughly with him, letting him bite and scratch her sleeve-covered arm and hand. She believes it helps get his aggression out. I believe it may be fueling the fighting. 

We’ve tried distracting him with other toys, spraying with water, and separating the cats.  It’s been four months and there doesn’t seem to be any improvement. 

Thank you all in advance for your thoughts. ",2024-04-01 20:04:09

Moving across the country with 2 dogs and 2 cats — advice and tips appreciated!,"As the title suggests, i will be moving cross country from NY to NV (shipping my belongings prior).

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated because this is a big ol first for me (and them)! 

I’ve been looking up pet friendly hotels but it seems as if there’s a pet limit of roughly two pets. do i call ahead and see if the hotels would change policy? do i sneak the kitties in?

I will be taking all animals to their vet prior for shot updates and possibly some medicine to keep them calm for the duration of the trip (i’m hoping for 4 days max). 

i thought about renting a mini van to drive them to NV, fly back to NY and then drive my car back again but i REALLY don’t want to make two treks if i don’t have to.

tips and advice is GREATLY appreciated!! ",2024-04-01 19:11:48

Question about elevated bowls,"My dog is almost 18 years old and still going strong. We switched her to a new food for elder dogs and absolutely loves it. Also, switched her bowls to an elevated bowl about 3 inches from the ground and I was reading that it can cause bloat. She's about 50 lbs and about 24"" to 30"" inches in height when standing on all 4 legs... She's a half jack russell terrier and basenji mix. The reason we switched her to an elevated bowl set is because it's less stressful on joints and her bending down to eat and drink. Do I need to worry about bloat?

Flea removal tips for an apartment with cats?,"I've been in aggressive cleaning mode (laundering every bit of fabric the cats could have come into contact with and bagging it up once clean, wiping surfaces, clearing off the floors to treat the carpet/corners with diatomaceous earth + vacuum), but my main problem right now is that the flea medication the vet prescribed won't get here until approximately Thursday. Is there anything I can do until then to keep the fleas off the cats and/or further slow down their reproduction cycle?

The reason I'm waiting for specific medication is that one of the cats had a scary allergic reaction the last time I gave him topical one. I've also seen a lot of people mention washing the cats with Dawn, but I'm hoping there's some other alternative because *I'm* unfortunately allergic to Dawn.",2024-04-01 11:32:02

Dog refuses to come inside without owner ,"I have a black lab mix. He’s about 11 years old. Good, healthy boy. Little bit of arthritis with his age and one of his back legs can give him a hard time, but overall, he’s in great shape. Goes on long walks daily and loves to chill. 

My father, the one that my dog loves the most in the universe, is on a trip out of country for 2 weeks. It’s probably the longest he’ll be gone since my dog was an elder. 

About a month ago, my father left for 3-4 days and it was okay - we got a dog walked and all was well, but Boomer (our old man doggy) was definitely depressed and emotional about it. 

Boomer is outside. Refuses to move. No treat, chicken, bully stick, NOTHING will make him move. It’s been nearly 2 hours. It’s cold, the grass is wet and his tail is glued to his body as he lays there. 

We don’t have a fence and there were coyote attacks within the last 2 weeks, but his leash is on and I just have it caught in the door so he cannot run off.

Any advice on what to do?",2024-04-01 11:09:09

"MY DOG HATES THE NEW CAT, I THINK?","So for 2 years now, my dog has lived with 2 cats (up u til last November it was 3 cats). He had no issues prior with them. Introducing went very well and from then, sometimes he'd even cuddle. My bf and and I moved in together brought in his 3yo cat. At first things were fine, but now he's been charging her and chasing her until she's out of reach. Teeth bared and growling. I don't know why, or what went wrong. BF offered putting his cat in a crate and letting them re-introduce, and ti be fair we did introduce rather quickly (but all seemed well, so I assumed it would be okay given his past with my girls)

Pom with Chylothorax - What do to,"Our 3-year-old Pom has chylothorax and been chest tapped twice, neatly 4 weeks apart. She is otherwise healthy (no cancer or heart disease). The vet recommended an extensive USD $10K+ surgery and a port for future chest draining. The port alone is $3K.  We are electing not to put her through the extensive surgery but are considering the port vs putting her down.

We have put her on rutin and a low-fat diet, but I am trying to be a realist and assume she will need draining again, potentially within 2-3 weeks if the rutin doesn't work. Once she's drained she seems otherwise happy and healthy. The vet says the port alone would allow us to drain the fluid more easily and we could even do it ourselves, and it would extend her quality of life. 

I'd appreciate hearing from someone who has experience with the port. Did the port function as intended? Did it seem to make your pet uncomfortable? To me sticking a needle into her chest and draining fluid sounds like it would be torture and I can't imagine she would sit still for it. If you drained the fluid yourself, did that cause your pet distress?  ",2024-04-01 09:37:34

"Take your dog's dental care seriously! Teeth cleaning and teeth x-ray is required every 1-2 years. No exceptions, specially as your dog gets older!","I just heard from the vet how a dog came with so many bad teeth requiring removal, and most likely caused the dog significant discomfort. So I feel obligated to give this reminder.
 
Please, take the dental care of our kind friends seriously. As they grow older, they will inevitably have teeth issues. **Tooth pain can be just as horrible to them as it is to us humans.** Except that they usually have a much higher pain tolerance than us and may not complain until it's very late, and by then they've already been in quite much discomfort.

So, always when you take them for teeth cleaning (which is every 1-2 years), get an x-ray of their teeth at same time, as the dog is already under anesthesia, anyway. A simple teeth x ray will show if any tooth is bad enough to need treatment or removal.

Don't underestimate this, as major discomfort caused by tooth pain can also cause them to be aggressive towards other pets in the same family. Take regular teeth x-ray from the dog!",2024-04-01 09:18:13

  Edit cause i keep getting the same comments over and over and i prob should have been more specific yes i know dogs need to go out on walks IM TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO LEAVE THEIR DOGS OUT SIDE ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT. 
  second i had a dog who refused to go outside she didn't like it so she was strictly an inside dog there is nothing wrong with it",2024-04-01 06:38:05

Is obedience genetically related? ,"I have an 11 year old Morkie which I got around when she was 9 weeks old and through out our entire time raising her she has been a very well behaved dog. She’s very obedient (occasionally she does what she wants, but 9/10 listens), very friendly with people, ok but kinda shy around other dogs, we don’t have kids but whenever bring their kids over she’s loves playing with them, well behaved at the vet/groomer/kennels and etc. I’ve always been amazed at how well she behaves because some of my friends dogs (from their own words) are somewhat bad and misbehave or can be aggressive. Idk if it’s the way my family and I have raised her or what because this has been my only pet and I don’t have experience with other animals like that. Anyone know or have pets that are well behaved?

Pet insurance with vet pay,"Hi! I currently have paw protect, which has 2,000 paytient credit. However they decided to do away with paytient. I will be cancelling because I can't pay so much upfront. My kitten is only 6 months so switching won't be a problem since she's healthy. 


Any recommendations for pet insurance for northeastern USA, (NY state)? I do like add ons like for vaccines and spay (which I need to cancel because I was planning on paying monthly with paytient 😭)",2024-04-01 04:19:56

People are so filthy now,"I take my dog on a leashed walk on a gravel path that takes about 20m one way. At both ends there are 2 trash cans. 

On the path there have been a few white garbage bags full of garbage dumped a few feet off the path.  I've taken numerous cooked chicken and pork bones out of My dogs mouth. And it's one thing if it's a goose or duck bone that came from a coyote kill. But they are cooked. I know the difference between a cooked and uncooked chicken/duck/ goose bone. 

Idk if it's from homeless people eating and dumping. There has been a huge increase of homeless camps in the area. Or just gross ordinary people with no respect 

I've talked to other dog owners in the area and they all said they have removed bones from their dogs mouths too.

It's hard enough finding good places to walk because there are few trails.  And now all the trails in the city have trash dumped on it. 

I had a friend who's dog swallowed a chicken bone and he had to take him to the emergency vet to have it removed.  Idk if people just don't know how dangerous bones are to dogs or they just don't care

The city just puts garbage cans in the area and hopes people use them. 

One of the better things about trails walks is not keeping your dog in a short leash. They get to run forward a but, reach smells further away.  

People are always ruining it for others

The amount of beer bottles too. When I was 5 I jumped off a sandune onto a broken bottle that was under some sand and I nearly bled to death. So I always pick up glass when I see it. Dog steps on that they could need stitches. 

I don't understand people sometimes ",2024-04-01 03:22:00

Need ideas on how to help my new foster cat.,"Some context: I have been fostering cats for some time now. The shelter has been trusting me to bring home the shyest and more feral cats because I have a lot of experience with cat behavior and I've been successful in befriending my fair share of feral kittens and cats, getting them ready for adoption. 

A few weeks ago I've been tasked with getting Gypsy ready, a 1.5 female cat that has been a little mystery to everyone. While definitely still part feral, Half the time she's very friendly. She is happy for someone to pet her, and immediately relaxes, puts her tail up and comes to rub herself on you. The first day I even managed to get her to stand over my legs a few times, which is quite impressive for a new cat. However, I immediately noticed she can be quite reactive. With minimal provocation or warnings, she will pin her ears back and swats quite hard. I wasn't overly concerned about this because it can be common at first. I usually just learn their triggers and avoid them until they are more comfortable, then build on them gradually. Her triggers are quite extensive, being touched anywhere but the back of her head and first half of the back. Being petted to rough, or with a closed hand or finger tips. Being approached while facing her directly. Again, I know how to work with all of this. To me it never mattered where a cat was starting at, I have time and patience.

With her however, other than what I mentioned above, she seems to get triggered at random. Sometimes I'm petting her, her body language is fully relaxed and all of a sudden she swats and draws blood. Sometimes I approach her slowly and she's fully relaxed. So I offer her my hand to see if she'll want to be petted, wait for the signal, and instead of looking away like usual rejection she straight up attacks.  Food and treats can make her very friendly sometimes. Other times she doesn't care for them and attacks. This behavior was quite confusing. The other night I was collecting food bowls to wash them, I didn't see her hiding nearby and as I go to grab a food bowl she attacks my hands. 

This is when I looked into her history. I found out that the property where she was born had two large dogs who constantly chased cats. To me this explains quite well why she's given up on subtle cues, dogs wouldn't listen so she never learnt the option of walking away or being tolerant. 

Otherwise she's very healthy, Spayed, vaccinated. She's not lonely, she came with a cat from the shelter who she was friends with, and is getting along well with my cats, even cuddling with them a few times. 

Anyone has any ideas or training methods I might have not thought of? I'm hopen to any comments or suggestions, or insights, anything can help.

Cats all of a sudden attacking each other,"We have had two cats living together now for 2 years. They’ve both done great up until last night. Around 11:30pm we heard running through the house and yowling, wrestling, and screaming from both cats. They have played rough with each other before but never like this. They have always co-existed and never gave us issues. They’ve even snuggled together. I began to walk the house to find any issues and I found drops of pee in the path of the running. Obviously one of them was terrified and peed while they ran.

Information about the cats:
Cat 1: Male, 8 years old, fixed
Cat 2: Female, 2 years old, fixed

Does anyone have any idea on what could have set them off like this? The older one is consistently hunting the younger one ever since. We have to lock the younger cat in a separate room to make sure the fighting doesn’t ensue.

Any advice or questions is appreciated!

Adopted a dog and not sure on whether it's the right time ,"
Hi, I have recently inquired about adopting a dog from someone who isn't the best owner. This dog has been somewhat neglected and hasn't been given any training whatsoever. She doesn't respond to her name, cannot sit, stay, or any other commands. She has quite severe separation anxiety and cries/howls when she is left alone for only a few minutes. The owner did not tell us about this and effectively lied to us.

We haven't official adopted her yet since I decided we should do a grace period to help her try and settle. I have autism and do not adjust well to changes or if something is off then I cannot cope. We had her overnight to see how she coped and she howled and didn't settle at all and essentially cannot be left alone, even for a few minutes.

Then the next morning the dog somehow escaped and I had to chase it around the entire estate, getting help from neighbours and other people. It was an extremely stressful event and I have effectively been crying the entire day. The previous owner is (no offence) a complete scum bag who hasn't trained her at all in her 6 years of life. I know about the 3:3:3 rule and puppy blues but this was different from when I first adopted a dog, I didn't really have puppy blues and was attached immediately and whilst I did have some anxiety, I was much healthier mentally back then and could cope with it effectively. 

At the moment my anxiety has been terrible for several years and I have had a very difficult time. I thought having a dog would help me become less anxious but it has only increased it more then it was before. I'm not sure I have the capacity to effectively train and give this dog the best life it can have but since I'm not the legal owner yet, if I was to return it I would have to give it back to a women who whilst would eventually find a home for the dog, would not take care of it effectively before that time. 

So I'm stuck between horrible guilt or massive amounts of anxiety from keeping a dog who is incredibly anxious and not well adjusted to a home life or has any training. 

So what should I do. ",2024-03-31 22:59:22
Adopted a dog and not sure on whether it's the right time ,"
Hi, I have recently inquired about adopting a dog from someone who isn't the best owner. This dog has been somewhat neglected and hasn't been given any training whatsoever. She doesn't respond to her name, cannot sit, stay, or any other commands. She has quite severe separation anxiety and cries/howls when she is left alone for only a few minutes. The owner did not tell us about this and effectively lied to us.

Returning to UK from EU - can't get rabies vaccination added to passport,"I will be returning to the UK with my cat on Friday and will be travelling through multiple EU countries (the Netherlands, Belgium and France) and will start by flying from Stockholm to Amsterdam. I came to Sweden 4 months ago from the UK, therefore my cat has received all of her vaccinations in the UK. Here in Sweden I got her pet passport but the vet cannot add the details of her rabies vaccination into the passport since she wasn't the vet that administered the vaccination.   
My questions are: Can I still travel with her pet passport and her vaccination booklet (which contains all of her vaccinations including the rabies one) throughout these countries?   
If not, will I be able to get her an Animal Health Certificate WITH the rabies vaccination details added onto that?   


If I can't do either of these, then I don't see how I will ever be able to leave the country unless I re-vaccinate her for rabies...  


I have been trying to contact all the different authorities in the different countries, including Jordbruksverket in Sweden but since its the Easter holidays, I won't get any answers until Tuesday which to me feels very stressful since I'm due to fly on Friday.

it's hard having puppy with parvovirus.,"We got new puppy but shortly after was diagnosed with parvo. First 24h I was awake the whole day and night being scared he could die at any moment and I wouldn't be there for him.  Later i learned how cantagious parvo really is so i'm spending most of tue day cleaning my house with steamer to kill it off. Vet said i should feed him special food he gave us every 1-2h on our 3rd day so i basically slept for 1h, woke up gave food cleaned the mess and desinfect it with steamer and would go back to sleep. I'm pretty tired as I slept roughly 8h in 3 days. Also it's pretty hard to have time to eat or take care of myself but I'm not regretting it because I would do anything for hom to survive as his just small living being needing care.

I know situation is not about me but I had to rant somewhere how is difficult for me too.. I hope my baby will survive and we would see greater days together ❤️",2024-03-31 18:24:53

Seresto collar problems?,"Posting this NSFW for the people that don't want to see a post like this.

I got seresto collars for my perfectly healthy dog and cat. About a month later my dog (9yrs, aussie shepherd) had his first seizure. Another about a month after that, then again two weeks later, and another about 12 hours after that. He's now on meds 2x a day forever. He's had the collar before but years ago. I got him one because my neighbors dogs were obviously flea ridden and I started seeing my own animals itching more frequently. Found two fleas on my dog after checking him routinely for months and not finding any, so I bought the collars. (He's had fleas before so I just get paranoid now when I see scratching and I start checking them.)

I can't post images I guess, but my cat (~5yrs, tortico) has developed a raw spot on her neck near the collar. I've seen her scratching at it but I didn't notice the bare spot until I took the collar off. It's scabbed over in about a 1"" area and there's about a 2"" spot that's completely bare with no fur.

The emergency vet I took my dog to said she doubts it would be the collar, that if it was it would have probably affected him sooner than a month. I removed both of them regardless. I'd rather risk the fleas at this point. 

I can't 100% confirm the collars caused all of this but what the hell. These animals were FINE and neither have had any medical issues in the past. I put them on and a month later they both start falling apart and now I have a special needs dog that needs a pill twice a day. 

Looking up the side affects I see it can cause convulsions in dogs and uncontrolled movements. My dog had 4 violent seizures where he was on his back kicking his legs in the air, then a postictal stage where he didn't recognize me and showed aggression, trying to BITE me, growling, etc. Ive had him his whole life this dog has NEVER shown aggression.  It was fucking traumatizing to witness.

For cats it says it can cause hair loss/irritation in the collar area which is exactly what's happening.

I guess I'm just reaching out to see if anyone else has had similar issues, and what they've done about it. I had my suspicion that it was the collar, but I kept it on until just before his last seizure. That compounded with the cat is almost too coincidental to ignore.

Does anybody know anything more about this? Do you think it's the collar? I guess aussies can have genetic epilepsy or something. But I don't know much more about it. Again this was a healthy active dog before February.

Thanks all",2024-03-31 10:37:18

I've seen her scratching at it but I didn't notice the bare spot until I took the collar off. It's scabbed over in about a 1"" area and there's about a 2"" spot that's completely bare with no fur.

The emergency vet I took my dog to said she doubts it would be the collar, that if it was it would have probably affected him sooner than a month. I removed both of them regardless. I'd rather risk the fleas at this point. 

I can't 100% confirm the collars caused all of this but what the hell. These animals were FINE and neither have had any medical issues in the past. I put them on and a month later they both start falling apart and now I have a special needs dog that needs a pill twice a day. 

Looking up the side affects I see it can cause convulsions in dogs and uncontrolled movements. My dog had 4 violent seizures where he was on his back kicking his legs in the air, then a postictal stage where he didn't recognize me and showed aggression, trying to BITE me, growling, etc. Ive had him his whole life this dog has NEVER shown aggression.  It was fucking traumatizing to witness.

For cats it says it can cause hair loss/irritation in the collar area which is exactly what's happening.

I guess I'm just reaching out to see if anyone else has had similar issues, and what they've done about it. I had my suspicion that it was the collar, but I kept it on until just before his last seizure. That compounded with the cat is almost too coincidental to ignore.

Does anybody know anything more about this? Do you think it's the collar? I guess aussies can have genetic epilepsy or something. But I don't know much more about it. Again this was a healthy active dog before February.

Thanks all",2024-03-31 10:37:18
Seresto collar problems?,"Posting this NSFW for the people that don't want to see a post like this.

I got seresto collars for my perfectly healthy dog and cat. About a month later my dog (9yrs, aussie shepherd) had his first seizure. Another about a month after that, then again two weeks later, and another about 12 hours after that. He's now on meds 2x a day forever. He's had the collar before but years ago. I got him one because my neighbors dogs were obviously flea ridden and I started seeing my own animals itching more frequently. Found two fleas on my dog after checking him routinely for months and not finding any, so I bought the collars. (He's had fleas before so I just get paranoid now when I see scratching and I start checking them.)

"Need advice, how the hell do I calm a bratty fish??","I have an Oscar fish (I think its written like that in english) and I have a problem. You see, recently, he has been doing things like splashing water on me. He has always liked to splash his water to make bubbles since he seems to like them, but now, it seems that he is aiming at me. He is also starting to ignore me (because he recognizes my voice and usually just looks at me), I took him to the vet and she said that he is perfectly healthy and that he is surely just throwing a tantrum?? I knew these fish were intelligent, but I never knew they threw tantrums. This is not my first fish, but this just took me off guard. So, how I make him happy????? He doesnt like any changes on his space, so decoration is not an option. He has a good feeding too, what do I do? Do I get him a friend??

Does anyone else have issues with cleaning wood pellet litter?,"Hey y'all, I switched from clay litter to wood pellet litter because it was available at the adoption center’s pet pantry for free and I wanted to try it. Off the bat, the smell was much better and there was a lot less dust. You know that ammonia smell that lingers with clay litter when you walk into your home? It's so gross. I rather smell like I’m at a lumber mill than a clay-ammonia concoction.

The sustainability aspect of pellets is a bonus for me since clay is mined and wood is renewable and is a byproduct.

The issue with pellets for me is the cleaning. It’s a whole hassle and struggle. I've got the sifting litter box but it's so hands-on and I don’t like being face-to-face with kitty piss every day. It’s messy, I spill the sawdust out sometimes because I’m either too rough or clumsy and it’s just a no...

Canine Distemper: considering euthanasia ,"My dog, Saber (schweenie), turning 4 y/o this June contracted CDV at the beginning of March. She’s fully vaccinated but unfortunately still got the virus. I was home with her for two weeks during my annual leave last February but I had to leave again because I work overseas and she’s left with my mom since I couldn’t bring her with me. Saber got depressed when I left. She lost her appetite and got anxious then the nightmare began. It started with respiratory issues. Thick mucus coming out her nose, difficulty in breathing, pus-like discharge around her eyes. The vet wont accept her when she got diagnosed with the disease since she might contract another disease in the hospital because they were already a full-house of sick animals. So my mom took her back home and followed the vet’s advice to keep her well-fed ang hydrated and making sure she got her medicine round the clock. My mom isolated her from the rest of the dogs at our house too. She started to improve on her second week. She’s eating on her own, started walking around the room like she was on her way to recovery. but last week, the second wave of the disease hit like a tsumani. She couldn’t sleep and she’s crying all night. Twitching got worse to the point where she can barely walk. She’s in a lot of pain. 😢 She can’t open her mouth and she couldn’t eat all by herself so my mom had to force feed her using a needle less syringe just to get her meds and food in her. This week marks her first month of fighting the virus. It’s very difficult to see her suffering like that especially that I’m away from her. Is it time for her to rest? I’ve read stories of CVD survivors which gave me hope. I’m still hoping that she’ll get through it regardless of the ticks that may be there for her entire lifetime. I don’t want her to die without me being there by her side. I blame myself too for leaving her. The guilt is eating me. My sister has a boston terrier waiting for Saber to come out of the room everyday so they could play. I’m considering euthanasia in a week’s time if we don’t see a significant improvement in her health. Please advise and also please pray for my Saber. 🥺😣",2024-03-31 04:37:28

Long story short she's been with me for 12 years and she's been a healthy girl even though she has had a tumor in his belly for a long time. Our vet informed us years ago that it wouldn't be wise to try and remove it. So she has cancer. A week ago,  my family went on a trip and Lilith was with them. She stayed in a cold room during the trip and she's not felt well since that day. Our vet diagnosed she's having a cold in her lungs. She received 1 serum yesterday which contained multiple vitamins and a couple of injections. At the moment she is getting another serum. Today, she ate for the first time in 5 days. She ate 50gr of chicken, which made us very happy. But that was all. It's been 8 hours and she hasn't eaten since this morning. She has no appetite for anything, drinks a lot of water, does not move much especially today (our veterinary told us the serum might make her sluggish but it's been 24 hours). So, I'm asking you to share your experiences and if you have any tips I'd appreciate them a lot. I love my Lilith very much and I don't want to lose her. I'm concerned for her life. Please help me and my girl.",2024-03-31 01:51:14

Help! Should I adopt another cat??,"
Hi! I really need help with this decision. Ok, so I have a 7-year-old female cat, which my family and I raised since she was 1 month old. She is literally our white princess and has helped us through a lot of tough times. For some time, I've been thinking about adopting an older cat, maybe a black one. I found an association that has a shelter, and they said they have a black cat, male, around 6 to 7-8 years old maybe. I got a message saying that he is sick now, has a cold, and that I can see him at the vet. When I got there, he was in pretty bad shape: leaky eyes, nose, and ears, dandruff, losing a lot of hair. Also, a brownish liquid came from his perianal glands, as the vet lady told me. She also advised me to really think about this because cats that were in communities and shelters may carry dormant viruses that pose a risk to my white cat. What would you do? I've kind of given up on the idea of adopting another cat, but it just hurts my soul… 
Thank you so much.",2024-03-31 01:40:37

Need advice for my cats,"Hi.. I really need immediate advice. My mom got my cats from the province cause no one can take care of them there. We're currently living in a long studio type apartment-ish (lol). My mom of course, live with me. So anyways, the problem is my mom doesn't want my cat inside the house cause of the smell but I can't bath them properly. I've tried all sorts of ways I saw on the internet but it still doesn't work, even the one where you have to hold the part behind their ears to stop them from moving..? It doesn't work. There are 4 3months old kitten and one adult cat. The adult one van roam freely outside the cage, but the kittens can't. My mom told me to let them out too, but every time I do that, the neighbors 2 cats gets aggressive towards them. Their cage is a small cage like a cage for dog. But I planned to get the cage where you can freely style..it... I guess...? I have it in the province but I don't know if that will be enough. I'm also a student so I usually get to class by 7 am and get home by 6pm. Can someone please give me an advice? Is it okay to just put them in the cage? I also have that circular cage. How can I prevent them from getting dehydrated and hungry while I'm away? How can I prevent them from being depressed or anxious? 

Ps. Part of me not wanting to get the kittens out of the cage is because of the neighbors aggressive cats. The adult cat's past kittens dies before we adopted her because it got eaten by a dog. I don't want her to feel that trauma again. Please help...",2024-03-30 21:22:59

Dog with anxiety ,"Hello!
We got our pup at about 3 mths via rescue, but we don't know much about his past. He has always been nervous and anxious so taking him on walks has been a challenge but he's such a sweet and gentle dog when not around any stress factors and he is quick to learn training commands and recognizes silent hand signals. We have a gate in the front yard and he is okay with our neighbors and generally with loud noises, but as soon as a stray cat comes around he starts pacing and becoming nervous and so distracted that any training cues go out the window. Now he is about 2 years old. I've tried different training tactics for outside/other animals, but nothing seems to help enough for us to go on relaxed walks or relax together in the front of the house. I want to do these activities with him! Any advice or suggestions is appreciated!",2024-03-30 20:18:32

Adopted Cat refusing to greet me after 5 weeks...,"Hello, my pup died a few years back of old age, and it took me a little time to come around again to wanting another pet. I've been searching for the last 3 or 4 months for a cat. About 5 weeks ago, I picked up a 3-year-old long-haired female cat who was unhappy in an old home and the owner was stating that she was unhappy with all the recent new pets in the house (couple about to get married), and was pretty grumpy. In the 5 weeks I've owned her, in the last 2 weeks, she was starting to come out during the evening before I went to bed and even in the morning before the sun came up. She would even troll around me as I sat on the couch. At one point she even came up to me as I tried to offer her a treat -- she didn't take it. She comes out at night and trolls all over the house, and plays in my guest bedroom with her felt balls, and other items the previous owner gave me.  This past Monday, I had some guests take the bedroom for one evening, and since then I just haven't seen her at all, and she's now not eating as well as she was for the first 4 weeks. 

At one point a few nights ago, before going to bed she must have ventured into my bedroom, unknown to me and she ran into the shower. I tried to sit there and communicate with her, but she was growling at me despite my efforts to be friendly with her. She wasn't having it, so I just left, and she scurried back under the couch at some point.  

Sometimes during the evening when I'm sleeping, I can see her sitting in the hallway outside my bedroom, she's easy to pick out having dark hair against my white tile floors and wall. I even heard her meow a few times last night, so I have no clue as to what's going on with this cat. It's been probably 20 years since another cat I owned and that cat was just chill - always. Was the best cat I had ever owned.

My neighbor has both a male and female cat and they both love me, just not sure what's up with this cat.  At this point, I'm sure you can imagine I'm feeling quite a bit let down in that I was looking for a companion. I'm 55 and I work from home and have a lot of time to be friendly towards a pet.  Sunday the 31st will mark 5 weeks since I've picked her up. 

Looking back on when I got her, after speaking with the owners, they took me into the room she was in, already in a pet travel container, of course she was scared, I'm sure but I had no actual time with the cat outside of the traveler, so I'm curious if that caused issues. Quite honestly I'm even wondering if this cat wants anything to do with me at this point.",2024-03-30 12:35:56

Sometimes during the evening when I'm sleeping, I can see her sitting in the hallway outside my bedroom, she's easy to pick out having dark hair against my white tile floors and wall. I even heard her meow a few times last night, so I have no clue as to what's going on with this cat. It's been probably 20 years since another cat I owned and that cat was just chill - always. Was the best cat I had ever owned.

My neighbor has both a male and female cat and they both love me, just not sure what's up with this cat.  At this point, I'm sure you can imagine I'm feeling quite a bit let down in that I was looking for a companion. I'm 55 and I work from home and have a lot of time to be friendly towards a pet.  Sunday the 31st will mark 5 weeks since I've picked her up. 

Looking back on when I got her, after speaking with the owners, they took me into the room she was in, already in a pet travel container, of course she was scared, I'm sure but I had no actual time with the cat outside of the traveler, so I'm curious if that caused issues. Quite honestly I'm even wondering if this cat wants anything to do with me at this point.",2024-03-30 12:35:56

Cat Fleas / Advocate,"Hi. I wanted to ask if there is/are other brand/s aside from Advocate which has/have the same effectiveness? My cats have fleas and whenever they get infected by those, I use the Advocate spot-on but these days my budget is tight and as we all know, Advocate’s a bit pricey and I’m kinda looking for an alternative budget-friendly spot-on treatment. If there’s none, I think I have no choice but to stick to Advocate. Thank you.",2024-03-30 12:01:42

I was just attacked by two Rottweilers. ,"I was out in a short walk with my two small dogs; a Japanese spitz and a small bichon poodle. As I was walking I heard the growls and they pushed their gate open and scape and immediately came after us. Bc of previous accidents when we moved here and another Rottweiler did the same thing I now carry a thick oak stick. I hit them hard with it as hard as I could even hitting their skulls and I think that might’ve saved our lives and I started screaming for help and luckily their neighbor came out and eventually they did. They said they had yard work done and the men forgot to latch their fence back in place. My babies are safe and I protected them and they were not harmed; I hope. 🤞🏼 

I’m so thankful to god my babies weren’t mauled and hurt in any way. My Japanese spitz has ptsd from being ran over by a white van before when he was a pup and my senior poodle has diabetes. I’m still shaking and crying bc of the amount of trauma I just went thru. I don’t want them dogs to be put down, but imagine if they would’ve attacked an old lady or a kid? I’m not that strong standing at 5.6” and 114lbs.

Idk if I should still contact animal control and file a report or ? 

I’m still so scared rn I wanna move out yesterday 😭😭😭 

Update: this is the 3rd time these dogs have attacked a person. My neighbor just told me they were chasing after him one time and luckily he made it safely to his house. He reported them as well as my other neighbor whose cat was mauled by them. ",2024-03-30 09:16:08

I'm thinking about building a platform to connect pet owners with the best deals on pet products and pet care services.,"Hey everyone!  
I'm a previous founder who's run multiple software businesses and I’m also a dog mom for 3 years (to a goldendoodle!). I’m really passionate about making sure she lives her life to the fullest by giving her the best diet possible and tons of exercise.   
In the last year I’ve met many other dog owners who have dogs that have various special dietary needs or illnesses (chicken or grain intolerances, joint issues and skin challenges) and are spending a lot of money on special dog foods and supplements to treat them. It sounds to me like a lot of the existing products out there charge a high amount for rather mediocre results. I've been trying to learn what's really important for pet owners, and how they decide what products to buy and use long term. I’ve been entertaining the idea of creating something that can dog owners find the best deals, products and services that will work the best for their dog, but would love to learn and talk to folks first before anything else. Specifically, I'm really interested in how you decide what to buy and if your pet has any specific requirements. Any other general tips/insights would be great as well.  
I know it's a lot of questions, and if you've gotten this far, and would be interested in sharing some of your insights with me, I'd love to get some time with you to chat! I'd be happy to buy you a coffee/tea in exchange for 30 min of your time. ",2024-03-30 09:10:26

"Yorkie with inflamed spinal disc, help please","My dog, Ellie, is nearly ten years old and I took her to the vet a few days ago due to her limping. They said that it could either be a tumor or a disc, and prescribed prednisone and gabapentin and full cage rest. She seemed to be doing much better until last night after I gave her the dosage. I went to go to sleep and she was so restless and upset so I stayed up with her for about four hours. I tried to take her to the bathroom but she was pretty drugged up because of the medicine, so I took her back in. I stayed with her until I calmed her down and put her to sleep in her crate. She woke me up, barking, 1.5 hours later and she was in the same position I put her to bed in. She had also peed on herself. This isn’t that alarming considering she hadn’t gone since the previous day, I had tried to take her out and she didn’t have to. Then I went to let her go to the bathroom outside but her front legs were not working so she just slumped forward. I picked her back up and called the vet and they said that the disc had likely inflamed. They said I could continue her medication and wait and see. She was completely restless and would not fall asleep and was panting. I called the vet again and they said to stop giving her the gabapentin as it could cause restlessness in some cases. For the past couple hours, she’s been resting in her crate in the laundry room and I have my ipad in there calling me so I can hear her. She seems to be resting, no panting. She is eating and drinking fine. I’m really worried, any advice?",2024-03-30 05:28:42

Cat Adopters Remorse,"Hi everyone, can I get a reality check or something? I adopted a cat 3 days ago to be a companion to my existing cat and I'm completely regretting it. I really wanted to enhance my first cat (Lighthouse's) quality of life with someone to play and snuggle and bond with, and I looked for a new cat for a couple months. I just got one (June) the other day and I'm just sick with regret... I do tend to second guess major life choices like this so I'm hoping it'll all turn out okay but I'm just thinking about the daunting task of introducing them.

There's been no growling or hissing or anything but they're really wary of each other, June has doordashed out of his isolation room a couple times. And they've been doing comparatively really well according to a friend, so I've switched out who stays in my room and who free roams, but often the cat in the room will just yell and yell to be let out and I'm worried it makes them more stressed.

I just keep thinking that I liked Lighthouse so much and my life with him was great and why did I decide to change it! And I'm nervous because I don't want to take June back for fear of being judged by friends/family, but I just wish I could go back in time...",2024-03-30 01:55:50

My cat's poop smells worse than usual?,"I switched my (5yo) cat's dry food over the course of a few days about a week ago from a no-grain diet kibble to hill's science light dry food (contains grain) and for the last three days his poop has smelled unsually foul (but not looser than usual) He's been eating and running around normally and hasn't thrown up. It may have something to do with adding grain to his diet but I'm not sure why it only started after a week of eating it?

At wits end with cats behavior at night,"For the past month, my cat has been waking my bf and me up every single night around 4am. She has an automatic feeder that goes off at both 11 pm and 4am to stop her from getting to hungry at night. That worked at first but now she will eat and then meow incessantly. We will put her outside the room in case she needs the bathroom, but five minutes later its just the sound of her body slamming against the door and her wailing. When she gets back inside she then starts trying to tear down anything on the walls and then eventually gives up and goes back to sleep.

We have no idea what to do to try and diminish this behavior. We've tried buying more toys to keep her entertained while we sleep and ignoring her meows has led to roommates waking up from the nose. If anyone has any advice we would love to hear it. Thanks!",2024-03-29 23:11:56

Question about mama cat behavior,Why is my mama cat biting her 5 day old kittens? Is this normal behavior or is she playing with them like prey? I’m a bit concerned that she could harm them. She still licks them and cleans them like usual but she bites them sometimes. Not very aggressively but nonetheless it kind of bothers me and I’m not sure if it’s normal or not.,2024-03-29 21:02:56

(vets in my area dont seem to have a clue either) i dont know if this is normal senior kitty behavior but lately he will bite me in the face randomly while purring even when im just letting him chill after he joins me (legit barely moments in of cuddling he will do this) 

And then there is him also constantly stretching his two paws up into my face and he seems to aim for my eyes bc currently even with me trying to back my face up witb my eyes closed he got one of my eyelids. hes 12 almost 13 - lost 1 canine 6 months ago (that i still dont know why as vet said as long as where the tooth was was a normal gum color he was fine and i apparently noticed him losing said canine long after it healed. i was just so worried bc its said adult cats shouldnt lose teeth but my vet said it was fine as long as it healed.

Cat keeps running out the door—Any advice to avoid it?,"I have three cats in total but only one of them tries to run out the door. When we are in the house he is very clingy/follows me everywhere I go but tries to run out whenever he gets the chance. I try to be aware of him when i’m leaving but sometimes he is just too fast. I spend all my time with him when I am home and I play with my cats very often. Is there anything I can do to stop him from wanting to run out? I have considered putting a leash on him and walking him outside so I can control where he goes but I don’t want him to think he can walk out whenever.

"I rescued a cat that got bit and has been living with me, how worried should I be? (Rabies)","Hey! I’m incredibly scared for myself, my cat and my family right now, and I am unable to see a vet for at least 24 hours so I’d really appreciate some insight.

I rescued a cat about two weeks ago, we took him to the vet for an initial checkup and everything seemed okay. A few days later we found a bite wound on her that apparently ruptured and the (different) vet said it was at least 5 days old, meaning it was there before we rescued him. We don't know what cat bit him, and the vet told us to get him his shots (including rabies) after his antibiotic course for the bite.

I've been consistently taking him for his antibiotic shots as that was my main priority and didn't pay much attention to the fact that he's still unvaccinated otherwise.

He was sleeping on my bed today and suddenly jolted awake and started approaching me while meowing loudly while showing teeth. He meows a lot but it's usually very soft. He also occasionally shakes the way a dog would when trying to dry themselves.

About a minute later he started purring again and rubbing up against me. I got a sudden realization that he could very much have rabies considering that he was bit and is unvaccinated.

I might be freaking myself out here but could it be rabies? Should I be worried? Should I go get a rabies shot?

I know rabies is usually transmitted through bites. I haven’t been bitten or scratched but my cat has licked me a lot and i might have touched an open wound or rubbed my eyes before washing my hands.

+ The country I live in has only had one confirmed human rabies case in the past 10 years but multiple confirmed cat and dog cases as far as I’m aware.",2024-03-29 12:57:42

"Cat Intestinal Mass, help!","Hey All,  
My 8 year old cat has an intestinal mass and I've been given the options of palliative care or surgical removal. I have had an ultrasound and xray done, as well as the aspirated needle and the results came back as abnormal cells with some dead cells/ tissue but none of them came back positive for cancer. The vet is assuming it could be a form of adenocarcinoma but wouldn't know unless they did an explorative surgery. I did a consultation with the surgeon and she was very kind and I felt comfortable with her but it's all unknown if the mass is even able to be removed, etc.  
He is a healthy cat and still has a lot of life left to live and seems relatively happy. He has decreased his interest in wet food and has been drinking a lot of water but also licking the outside of the water dish. The vet said it was caught early which is good but I'm truly at a loss of what to do. He was curious at the surgeon's office and even put his paws on her lap but then was also trying to find a place to hide in the cabinet and started drooling toward the end of the visit. When I was on the phone with the surgery unit this morning, he started meowing a lot and was bumping his head into my hands for pets and I'm not sure if he just wanted my attention or if he was trying to tell me something.  
I'm scared of putting him through such an invasive surgery that they can't guarantee any results from and I don't want him to decline after the surgery. I also don't want to feel like I should have done the surgery if I opt for palliative care.  
I spoke with both my vets (different cities) and both said they would go with the more conservative approach and do palliative care but I'm on the fence since he's still healthy and it was caught early. I just would be absolutely devastated of putting him through surgery and it didn't help him have a better quality of life for a long time. He's my best friend and he's been stressed with going to the vet so often and I hate seeing him suffer but I don't want to do this if it's not going to benefit him for the long run.  
I've read TONS of Reddit posts already about different experiences with surgeries and such, but most of them related to intestinal blockages which I think is similar but I'm not positive. I'm a nervous wreck and don't want to make any rash decisions. Anyone have any experiences or insight similar to this? Sorry for the long post!!",2024-03-29 09:00:20

I spoke with both my vets (different cities) and both said they would go with the more conservative approach and do palliative care but I'm on the fence since he's still healthy and it was caught early. I just would be absolutely devastated of putting him through surgery and it didn't help him have a better quality of life for a long time. He's my best friend and he's been stressed with going to the vet so often and I hate seeing him suffer but I don't want to do this if it's not going to benefit him for the long run.  
I've read TONS of Reddit posts already about different experiences with surgeries and such, but most of them related to intestinal blockages which I think is similar but I'm not positive. I'm a nervous wreck and don't want to make any rash decisions. Anyone have any experiences or insight similar to this? Sorry for the long post!!",2024-03-29 09:00:20
good exercise for cats?,"I have two cats - one is extremely food-motivated and begs for treats all day; the other is less interested so much skinner. I tried microchipped food bowls but the skinny cat was too timid to use it. I'm considering exercising my chubby one - any tips? 

one is 12lbs and the other is 8lbs, they are sisters from the same litter and domestic shorthair. ",2024-03-29 08:30:34

What happens when you max out pet insurance benefits in the first quarter?,"I presume they want you keep paying premiums for absolutely no benefit,right?   I am tempted to cancel and find a different company to start over.

Help! Something is wrong with my cat,"A few days ago we let our cat become an outdoor cat because he REALLY wanted to go outside. He was doing fine but something happened.  Yesterday he got into a fight with a cat that looked just like him, maybe a bit larger. Today he was outside, the same cat started attacking him, possibly humping him (?) my cat started screaming really loud and when we opened the door he immediately ran in.  
 My cat secluded himself in my moms room,  hissing and bitting anyone who tried to touch him. eventually he calmed down and sat in a spot starring depressingly. He's ok with me touching his head briefly but when I try to touch his  backside he has a really big reaction, hisses + groans really loud and attacks me. He refuses to eat food or drink water. He stars at us really sad, watching our every move like he's scared. Right now he's sleeping. Me and my mom also found discharge on the bed, like from his private parts. I'm not sure what to do. Was my cat r@pped? I cant look at his private parts because he wont let me. What should I do?",2024-03-29 08:06:53

Helping injured dog up the stairs!,"Hi all! My partner and I are adopting our first dog and we are super excited. We have had cats and exotics before, have done lots of dog sitting, and grew up with dogs, but this is our first one of our own! We are adopting the sweetest girl - shes 7 years old and has some medical needs, mainly being very overweight (previous owner fed her people food, lots of peanut butter, and didn't walk her) and she also has a torn ACL. We're prepared to take care of all her medical needs, and are getting a referral to hydrotherapy for her to help with recovery. We're confident she'll heal up and lose the weight, and are happy to be patient and take care of her while she recovers.

Our current issue is that we live in a 2 story house and her foster mom says she's very cuddly and wants to be around her people all the time. My partner works from home so he's around to give her lots of attention, but his office and our bedroom is on the second floor. We really want her to be able to be with him during the day, and in our room at night but we're trying to figure out how to get her up the stairs with this injury and her weight. We know that the most likely scenario is that she sleeps by herself downstairs at night and my partner moves his office setup to the ground floor for the day time. But we're really trying to figure out a way for her to be upstairs. Does anybody have any suggestions on how we can help her up the stairs? She's currently around 65-70 lbs (she should be 35) and my partner can't carry her up and down by himself while I'm gone. We've got a ramp for the car and our back stairs so we've got that covered, but our indoor stairs are too long and steep for that. I looked into a motorized stair chair, but I don't really want to spend $10-12,000 on that when hopefully she'll recover in the next few months.

I know this might not be possible, but if anybody has ideas for how to get our sweet girl up the stairs, we'd be grateful! We bring her home next week, and are trying to get all our ducks in a row beforehand. We are hopeful that she heals quickly and is able to make it up the stairs on her own or with minimal assistance!

Saying goodbye to my sweet boy Monday ,"I hope this is allowed.

I have a 20yr old shih tzu. The sweetest boy. He has cancer and renal failure. The medication and treatments are no longer on his side. His quality of life is no longer there. We're doing all his favorite places this weekend, his favorite foods.

I made the decision to send him over the rainbow bridge on Monday. I'm going to miss him so damn much. 

However, i don't know anything about the process. He is my first pet. Will he be in pain? Will it hurt? Will he be mad at me? 

I do have another dog. They are so close and so bonded. Do I need to watch for any signs with her? What should I do to comfort her?

Thank you in advance!

Is my dog being a brat or am I doing something wrong? (ADVICE PLS),"I have had my dog pepper since I was 13. I'm now 19 and he's my ESA for my disability but lately he's been acting very strange. I guess brat seems like a strong word and I don't believe he's a bad dog or anything but I don't know how else to describe it. He seems very indecisive and stressed but I'm not sure how to alleviate this. For example, he will jump up and ask to be held but when I do he wants to get straight down or he wants to leave the room but whines at my door when I let him. And every time I take him out and he pees and poops he wont stop whining after coming back in. He's got his food, water, and treats so I don't know what else to do to make him comfortable. I take him on multiple 10 minute walks everyday and he's a small dog so it seems like enough but he doesn't seem satisfied. And it's really strange because when he and I were still in my parents house he didn't like being outside all the time anyway. I've tried things like CBD to help him relax which does help a bit or toys but he's totally unimpressed. He also never really left my room at home either and would even refuse to leave it and go outside. Is he just spoiled or am I doing something wrong? I'm a student so I can't just hold and entertain him all day plus that seems like he'll just get separation anxiety.",2024-03-29 06:25:34

I feel like my girlfriend is neglecting our shared cat. Any input appreciated!,"We got a kitten about 4 months (named fig), we live separately so we agreed to trade the house she would stay at every week or two. She's a super curious torbie and seemed to have no issue with changing environments back and forth at first, but the way things worked out I ended up having her at my house most of the time we've had her.

My girlfriend is one of those people that wants to treat a cat like a doll. She picks fig up and squishes her and kisses her and says why don't you love me, when fig is obviously trying to get away. I have seen her do a few things that I'm just like hey you're freaking the cat out chill.

More importantly my gf lives in a small apartment and doesn't really play with the fig. Every time I go over there fig will be super wound up and constantly attacking my feet and my hands. At first I thought it was maybe because she had more space to run at my house, i have two bedrooms, a garage, and a small yard. I run around with her with a wand toy until she's worn out, multiple times a day, I open all the doors so she can sprint back and forth, and I take her outside on a harness for a bit almost every day. I noticed my girlfriend will just kind of set toys out and expect the cat to entertain herself, and then push her away if she wants attention. I told my girlfriend that she should maybe try to actively play with fig more, actually help her get some exercise and wear her out, and she just got upset with me and told me that ""she does"".

At some point my girlfriend had fig while I was visiting family and left fig with her roommate, who in turn left her alone by herself at the apartment for multiple nights. I guess he would go back over and feed fig at some point during the day? But like 12/16 hours alone as a kitten in a small apartment. I was honestly pretty upset and again my girlfriend was just like oh its no big deal.

When I got back from visiting family I noticed that fig had developed this bald spot on her head, and not just like the normal thin hair in front of the ears, like basically no hair. I told my girlfriend I was concerned about it and thought it could be from fig stress grooming when she was left alone/ I was gone. My girlfriend argued that fig was just as attached to her roommate as she is to me and that it was only a night or two that she got left alone. Low and behold since I've been home and had fig a majority of the time, the bald spot grew back completely. I have heard my gf on the phone with her roommate arguing about feeding fig, and know that she has left fig with her roommate and the roommate has forgotten to feed fig multiple times.

I love this cat and I'm starting to think that she's actually really stressed out/unhappy/not being taken care of properly at my girlfriend's house. I don't really feel like it's something I can bring up because the few times I have tried to mention anything small it has turned into me getting yelled at. I know that she is also attached to the cat at this point, but I'm starting to feel concerned and worried when she comes to pick fig up. The longer we've had her the more it seems like she's unhappy about having to go over there. This is my first pet as an adult, and I know it was such a stupid decision to ""share"" her with my girlfriend.

I just want what is best for fig and I would appreciate any advice about the situation!

UPDATE: Ok woah way too many response for me to get back to everyone. Thanks so much for all the input. Yeah we have already been in the process of figuring out where we are in our relationship anyways. I think I've been picking up on some traits that I hadn't really seen in her at first, and this pet stuff just highlights some of those issues. I got up at 6:30 this morning with Fig and was thinking about how pretty the sunrise was, and that reminded how my gf had told me she would wrap herself up in her blanket in the morning so fig couldn't wake her up until she wanted to get up. It's just that kind of stuff, you don't just get to sleep until 11 and have your cat deal with it because you don't care enough to get up and feed her or play with her. I'm just going to keep Fig here moving forward, if my gf wants to come over and see her she can and if she doesn't, she doesn't.

On a positive note, I got Fig one of those interactive whack a mole games and a 5 way tunnel yesterday and she absolutely loves both of them! ",2024-03-29 04:34:11

Any input appreciated!,"We got a kitten about 4 months (named fig), we live separately so we agreed to trade the house she would stay at every week or two. She's a super curious torbie and seemed to have no issue with changing environments back and forth at first, but the way things worked out I ended up having her at my house most of the time we've had her.

My girlfriend is one of those people that wants to treat a cat like a doll. She picks fig up and squishes her and kisses her and says why don't you love me, when fig is obviously trying to get away. I have seen her do a few things that I'm just like hey you're freaking the cat out chill.

More importantly my gf lives in a small apartment and doesn't really play with the fig. Every time I go over there fig will be super wound up and constantly attacking my feet and my hands. At first I thought it was maybe because she had more space to run at my house, i have two bedrooms, a garage, and a small yard. I run around with her with a wand toy until she's worn out, multiple times a day, I open all the doors so she can sprint back and forth, and I take her outside on a harness for a bit almost every day. I noticed my girlfriend will just kind of set toys out and expect the cat to entertain herself, and then push her away if she wants attention. I told my girlfriend that she should maybe try to actively play with fig more, actually help her get some exercise and wear her out, and she just got upset with me and told me that ""she does"".

At some point my girlfriend had fig while I was visiting family and left fig with her roommate, who in turn left her alone by herself at the apartment for multiple nights. I guess he would go back over and feed fig at some point during the day? But like 12/16 hours alone as a kitten in a small apartment. I was honestly pretty upset and again my girlfriend was just like oh its no big deal.

When I got back from visiting family I noticed that fig had developed this bald spot on her head, and not just like the normal thin hair in front of the ears, like basically no hair. I told my girlfriend I was concerned about it and thought it could be from fig stress grooming when she was left alone/ I was gone. My girlfriend argued that fig was just as attached to her roommate as she is to me and that it was only a night or two that she got left alone. Low and behold since I've been home and had fig a majority of the time, the bald spot grew back completely. I have heard my gf on the phone with her roommate arguing about feeding fig, and know that she has left fig with her roommate and the roommate has forgotten to feed fig multiple times.

I love this cat and I'm starting to think that she's actually really stressed out/unhappy/not being taken care of properly at my girlfriend's house. I don't really feel like it's something I can bring up because the few times I have tried to mention anything small it has turned into me getting yelled at. I know that she is also attached to the cat at this point, but I'm starting to feel concerned and worried when she comes to pick fig up. The longer we've had her the more it seems like she's unhappy about having to go over there. This is my first pet as an adult, and I know it was such a stupid decision to ""share"" her with my girlfriend.

I just want what is best for fig and I would appreciate any advice about the situation!

UPDATE: Ok woah way too many response for me to get back to everyone. Thanks so much for all the input. Yeah we have already been in the process of figuring out where we are in our relationship anyways. I think I've been picking up on some traits that I hadn't really seen in her at first, and this pet stuff just highlights some of those issues. I got up at 6:30 this morning with Fig and was thinking about how pretty the sunrise was, and that reminded how my gf had told me she would wrap herself up in her blanket in the morning so fig couldn't wake her up until she wanted to get up. It's just that kind of stuff, you don't just get to sleep until 11 and have your cat deal with it because you don't care enough to get up and feed her or play with her. I'm just going to keep Fig here moving forward, if my gf wants to come over and see her she can and if she doesn't, she doesn't.

3 mo old kitten goes nuts around human food,"Boyfriend and I recently adopted a 3 month old male kitten. Sweet as can be, but he is completely obsessed with obtaining food. He breaks into bags and containers with varying degrees of success, tries to grab whatever food either of us is eating or preparing, tries to get into the trash can, etc. We have taken to putting him in the bedroom whenever we are eating or making food. The real issue is that he bites and scratches HARD when we have to remove something from his mouth or grip. It's like he goes feral for a second. He bit my boyfriend and drew blood the other day over a piece of pizza and he bit me hard enough leave a puncture wound and bruise when I tried to get a piece of cheese from him. Obviously I'm learning I have to retrieve the food more indirectly and stay away from his mouth. 

What can we do to nip this bad habit? He's a complete doll in every other regard. My theory is that he must have spent some time on the streets or in a dumpster and had to scavenge for food. Is he likely to grow out of this? Any suggestions on how to discourage these behaviors? Thanks in advance",2024-03-29 04:20:23

Emotional Support Animal Websites…,"I hope this is the right place to post, I apologize if not.

My doctor says realesaletter.com is legit, but I don’t know.

Background : I have had my emotional support animal for eight years. I have also lived at my current apartment for the same amount of time. Recently my apartment complex decided to change from a local manger to a management company. All is good, but they want me to get a new emotional support animal document since mine is so old. I completely understand, so I set up an appointment with my new doctor which isn’t cheap (I got him two years ago). My old doctor moved states two years ago, and I lost contact with her. My new doctor said I definitely qualify to keep my animal due to my medical conditions but he does not write the documentation anymore. That really confused me, but it’s been so many years since I got one. He recommended I go to the website realesaletter.com and that it’s legit. Anything named “real” makes me think scam. Is this legit? he assured me it was and his patients use it. When I got my document years ago it was free and a letter my old doctor wrote up, this website I have to pay $150+ and get a meeting with an online psychiatrist it seems. I was wondering if this is normal these days or if you have used similar websites?

Current Banfield Employee - My experience and why I do not recommend working here,"Hey! 

I am currently working at a Banfield Pet hospital at a CSC, or client service coordinator, which is basically a fancy name for a receptionist. I applied to Banfield because my boyfriend's grandpa worked for Banfield for 20 years and had a great experience. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same. 

I have learned that Banfield is ALL about revenue and getting as many appointments as possible. Their OWP's, or optimum wellness plans, are in my opinion a scam. People think they are signing up for pet insurance, but no, it is a preventative care plan that includes things like routine vaccines, comprehensive exams, bloodwork, and free office visits. Banfield does not do emergency surgeries, severe illness, etc. The amount of times I have had clients yell at me over the phone because they were frustrated that we couldn't take in their extremely sick dog is too many to count. 

All of the staff, ESPECIALLY the VA's are severely overworked and underpaid. Here is my pro's and con's list, and keep in mind that this is from training at one location for one month and then working at my current location for the past 4 months. 

**Pros:** 

* 4 day work week
* I am able to have the same work schedule as my boyfriend
* My coworkers are easy to work with 
* Good benefits 

**Cons:** 

* Too many responsibilities/duties to do within one work day 
* **Constantly** yelled at by clients, both over the phone and in person 
* Revenue is valued more than quality care 
* Not working enough hours due to lack of doctors 
* When I work by myself at the front I don't always get to take an uninterrupted lunch 

I am currently applying to independent veterinary clinics. Banfield as a whole just seems to be going downhill, with its quality of service declining while their doctors are pushed to add on unnecessary services to client's visits. I know that Mars is a corporation and they have to make money, but if they want to have the word **hospital** in their name something has to change! ",2024-03-29 02:20:41

"Grief, regret & sadness","I know I may get judgement and hate for this post, but I don’t know if I’m looking for advice, support, or just need to vent. I don’t even know. I had 4 cats. 2 females, who I adopted 7 years ago and 2 males, adopted 2 years ago. I love them immensely. I do also have 2 dogs. The older cats were not fans of the dogs and one of them, Gracie, became very stressed out and she would never come downstairs like the other 3 cats. She became very skittish. One of the young males would also bully her and she was very submissive. Caring for 6 animals became very exhausting. One of the female cats had been pooping outside the litter box for years. No health issues, she just did this regardless of the litter, litter box, cleanliness, etc. I dealt with it, just cleaning it up and moving on. Ever since bringing the male cats home 2 years ago, I was constantly, I mean twice a day cleaning up cat pee because one of them was pissing right outside the litter boxes. No matter what I did to fix this, nothing worked. They were all healthy, so it came down to being a behavioral territorial issue. I work long hours away from home and it was really taking a toll on me. I guess I was just so overwhelmed. The constant pooping & peeing outside the litter box. After a lot of back and forth, I felt that maybe I was just not equipped to properly care for 4 cats, I convinced myself that they deserved better and surrendered them to the humane society on 3/23/24. I thought I was doing right by them. I really did. 

I have felt nothing but immense regret since walking out that facility. The very next day I went back and explained to them how much I regretted my decision and realized this is not what I wanted, I begged, I cried, I pleaded, I offered to pay adoption fees for all 4 and donate. After 4 long days of back and forth with them they told me no, basically suck it up because ownership now belongs to them. I feel so empty, so broken, so mad at myself. It was a moment of confusion and frustration that led me to make such a stupid decision & I will regret it the rest of my life. I feel desperate, I would do absolutely anything to get them back. I’ve messaged the chair board with no response, I’ve sent pictures of how happy they were here. Nothing. 

I’ve never felt so heartbroken and depressed in my life. I feel like a disgusting person who screwed up and ruined the most beautiful relationships. Every corner of my house reminds me of them.

"Grief, regret & sadness","I know I may get judgement and hate for this post, but I don’t know if I’m looking for advice, support, or just need to vent. I don’t even know. I had 4 cats. 2 females, who I adopted 7 years ago and 2 males, adopted 2 years ago. I love them immensely. I do also have 2 dogs. The older cats were not fans of the dogs and one of them, Gracie, became very stressed out and she would never come downstairs like the other 3 cats. She became very skittish. One of the young males would also bully her and she was very submissive. Caring for 6 animals became very exhausting. One of the female cats had been pooping outside the litter box for years. No health issues, she just did this regardless of the litter, litter box, cleanliness, etc. I dealt with it, just cleaning it up and moving on. Ever since bringing the male cats home 2 years ago, I was constantly, I mean twice a day cleaning up cat pee because one of them was pissing right outside the litter boxes. No matter what I did to fix this, nothing worked. They were all healthy, so it came down to being a behavioral territorial issue. I work long hours away from home and it was really taking a toll on me. I guess I was just so overwhelmed. The constant pooping & peeing outside the litter box. After a lot of back and forth, I felt that maybe I was just not equipped to properly care for 4 cats, I convinced myself that they deserved better and surrendered them to the humane society on 3/23/24. I thought I was doing right by them. I really did. 

I have felt nothing but immense regret since walking out that facility. The very next day I went back and explained to them how much I regretted my decision and realized this is not what I wanted, I begged, I cried, I pleaded, I offered to pay adoption fees for all 4 and donate. After 4 long days of back and forth with them they told me no, basically suck it up because ownership now belongs to them. I feel so empty, so broken, so mad at myself. It was a moment of confusion and frustration that led me to make such a stupid decision & I will regret it the rest of my life. I feel desperate, I would do absolutely anything to get them back. I’ve messaged the chair board with no response, I’ve sent pictures of how happy they were here. Nothing. 

I’ve never felt so heartbroken and depressed in my life. I feel like a disgusting person who screwed up and ruined the most beautiful relationships. Every corner of my house reminds me of them. I can’t stop crying because I miss them so much it hurts. All I can think of is having my babies back home.

Animal Communicators,"Hey everyone! Just wondering if anyone’s done an animal communication session that they felt was legit. If so, who was it? I had to put down my fear reactive (no warning signs before several bite attempts, over a year and a half of private and group training, behaviorists, meds, months of trying to rehome) dog back in October and I cry every time I think about her. I was considering animal communication sessions to try to get some closure, but only if they’re not scams. She was my soul dog and I just want to know she’s okay and knows how much I love her and how hard I tried for her. Please no negative comments about BE, it was the hardest decision I have EVER made and it was recommended to me by all the trainers I saw, the vet, and the people at rescues and shelters I reached out to.

How to I prevent a cat from eating dog food?,"I have a 10 year old dog. I am thinking of getting a cat - he’s been around cats before and enjoys their company. However, my dog is a grazer - he eats when he feels like it, taking little nibbles here and there and some days he doesn’t even eat. He’s always been this way. I tried to train him to have meal times when he was a puppy but he’s supper stubborn. He gets a mixture of canned and kibble. I’m worried that the cat will eat his food. Would a cat eat dog food? How would I be able to prevent this (if it’s possible at all)? Thanks!",2024-03-28 23:39:27

Why is my cat obsessed with licking me?,"Hey all,

Myself and my partner have 2, 1.5 year old cats (domestic short hair tuxedo. 1 male 1 female). The female will 99% of the time do everything she can to lick my hand/arm whenever I pet her. She will stop at nothing to lick me and will sometimes actually try to grab into my arm to get the licks in. The male never does this with me, and my partner never gets kicked aside from the occasional kiss.

I know she's happy as she's constantly purring away when getting pets. I'm not too bothered by it just wondring why she might be so obsessed with licking me!",2024-03-28 22:43:23

Tranquilizers/Sedation ,The vet gave our dog WAY to much sedative and she's been in and out of consciousness for the past almost day. She's really old is there any way we can get her up. She was still responding to food and eating. But we can't get her to stand and go outside. She weights somewhere around the 30lb rate maybe little more. I just don't know if there is like doggie smelling salts or something ,2024-03-28 22:29:56

Rehoming my cat tomorrow and feel tremendous grief ,"So unfortunately I have to rehome my cat. I’ve had him for almost 6 years. He’s my baby I’ve had since he was 3 months old and got him from the ASPCA where I live.

I just can’t deal with all the peeing anymore. I personally have had to replace my mattress 3 times. My mom lost her couch and he’s pissed on her bed as well. Now as a last resort, my girlfriend decided to try and help and took him in. Same thing happened. Mattress and couch were toast.

The thing is, I took him to the vet at least 3-5 times at least when I could and they always gave him a clean bill of health. I tried to keep his litter clean and tried the pheromone spray stuff as well as deterrent for places he’s already peed on and did vinegar soaks and stuff like that. Literally everything I could to try and correct this behavior. No difference. I tried changing up his environment thinking where I was living was too chaotic for him. Nothing worked.

I just feel like I’m making the wrong decision but deep down, I feel relief and I hate that.

I don’t have the money or time or housing to keep him anymore and I wish I did.

Please tell me I’m making the right decision. He’s my first cat of my own (I had two growing up) and I feel like I’m letting him down and every time I think about the day I give him away, I just think he’ll feel so betrayed and unloved. I can’t and don’t want him to feel that way. I know he’s just a cat but he’s my cat. And I’ll never see him again.

At least for now. 
Until tomorrow morning at 9am.

EDIT:
Thank you all for your suggestions and teaching me other ways to handle this in the future before it gets to this point. I've realized there was more going on for this little guy than meets the eye and a lot of it had to do with environment as well as not being the best owner. Which I realized the latter when I started college online and rarely had the time to give him the attention he deserves. I forgot to mention that as well. :facepalm: But I really do appreciate those who were kind enough to not pass judgement and give alternatives to help him. Unfortunately I believe this is a lesson for me in the future. I wish I could have been better suited for him but unfortunately I am not the one for him nor is my location/situation.

EDIT 2:
After calming myself down a little and thinking about it for a minute, I've decided I'll try to get him into temporary housing. I found a place in my area that will take him for free but with an application process. I've ordered him reusable diapers in the meantime and with my interview this afternoon, if that goes through, then I'll be able to be in a better location, better financial situation and more say on where his territory is and better funds to actually see an entirely different vet for a 19th opinion. This is my last hurrah though.",2024-03-28 21:26:49

 Cancer diagnosis ,"My 10 year old Vizsla had a mass removed from her mouth on 3/18. We got the results yesterday stating melanoma and referred us to an oncologist. I spoke with them yesterday and we are waiting to be scheduled. After reading her biopsy results it does states that it appears to be confined to the dermis.  We are all devastated. She’s the sweetest dog and has not shown any signs of illness or pain recently. She eats, drinks, uses the bathroom fine and is active. Has anyone been down this road that could share some insight?

Service dog ,So I have anxiety and panic attacks and was told I needed a service or emotional support animal. Two days ago I got a puppy and was trying to see weather he’d be a better service or emotional so I took him out with me on the streets (caring case as he isn’t certified and I wanted no risks in case he reacted wrong to others) well out on the streets 3 dogs came up to us barking at him and he completely ignored them. Waiting for the bus my friend stood very close (he has never met her till that exact moment) and he ignored her completely didn’t try to jump out for her at all and was never vocal once didn’t bark or anything at all till he had to let me know he needed to pee . Later on I went into a Starbucks and the employees were baby talking him yet he proceeded to ignore them completely and same with the people in the stores I took him in (pet friendly) not once did he bark at other animals or people. And not once did he beg for attention by barking or whining. I’ve also had him wake me up from nightmares and I’ve noticed he becomes impatient whenever I start feeling overwhelmed (I’m a high school student and got overwhelmed by a test) so I’m thinking maybe I should train him to be a service dog ,2024-03-28 17:15:10

Dog Attack Dispute,"Last year a neighbourhood dog savagely attacked my (at the time) 3 month old puppy who required emergency surgery for multiple punctures and lacerations around his head/ face. 

The owner of the other dog came with us to the overnight vet and paid the initial deposit for our puppy’s surgery which we greatly appreciated. Our puppy had to stay over night, so we left together with the other dogs owner. 

When we went to collect our pup the next morning we had the remaining bill to pay which was close to double the deposit. 

He had agreed that he would pay, but once we told him how much it was, he’s started ignoring us. His dog has been reported, neutered (as it wasn’t at the time and was very aggressive - it still is a very hostile dog)

He owes quite a lot of money, which my girlfriend has been paying interest on. But we don’t know what we’re supposed to do to get this guy to pay off the bill? Not sure if anybody’s been in a similar situation?

got cat spayed !! (update),"making this post because one or two people asked for an update. 

in very happy and relieved to say that she’s pretty much completely back to normal (it’s been 2 days). yesterday when i got home she came running to me to greet me like she normally does, she’s begun to walk/trot at the same speed as before (she’s not running yet but i don’t think she should), she’s also regained her appetite and she’s being affectionate again (she loves rubbing her head on everyone’s feet and laying in front of them with her tummy exposed to ask for belly rubs - she’s doing all of that again, although we have been careful not to touch her wound).

i take off her cone around 3 times a day for 5-10 mins under supervision and i haven’t let her lick her wound at all. she doesn’t like the cone and keeps trying to get it off. she also isn’t used to getting around with it on so she keeps bumping into stuff and knocking over stuff, it’s very cute.

anyways, im very happy she’s doing well. it was hurting my heart to see her be all tired and distant ",2024-03-28 13:54:00

Cat Bites,"Some background: my sister was blessed by the cat distribution system when one random day, an orange cat showed up on her porch. He was meowing and desperately wanting to come inside her house. She brought him in but is allergic so he had to stay with a friend of hers. He was well groomed so it didn’t look like he had been outside long. They took him to the vet- he wasn’t fixed and appeared to be around 8 months. The vet said it’s typical for people to dump cats around that age (absolutely disgusting, I know). Where my sister lives, the shelters are very over populated and it made more sense for the cat to come stay with me while we get him fixed and taken care of at the vet. At first he was a big cuddle bug but now he really isn’t one to nap on me or anything. He was neutered about 10 days ago. 

Current situation: I have 3 cats and I live in a studio apartment. My 3 cats are on the lazy side of the cat temperament scale so they do just fine in my space. This new cat just has more energy. He has plenty of toys but he always just wants to be around me, involved in anything I’m doing. He chases my cats and it seems like he just doesn’t understand that they’re not playing back when they hiss and swat at him. I’ve described him like a sour patch kid because he is the sweetest boy most of the time but he can be a menace at times as well. He’s constantly rubbing my leg, jumping on counters, begging for pets. I’ve noticed he doesn’t like sleeping on me but has loved when I pick him up and pet him and kiss his face. I can read his signs pretty well and tell when he’s getting overstimulated and I’ll set him down. Today while holding him he was falling asleep, purring, showing all the signs that he was enjoying what was happening, when all the sudden he just attacked my face. He bit down hard enough to break skin and tried to stay latched/ bite down harder even after I was very clearly yelling at him to get off me. These weren’t the bites cats will sometimes do like love bites, my other cats will do that occasionally. He also got me with his claws. So aside from these marks on my face now, I’m really just not sure what to do with him. I haven’t committed to keeping him but we’ve formed somewhat of a bond over the past couple weeks. I’m scared he might just be aggressive but I’m curious if anyone has had similar things happen with their cats and if it’s something you think he’d grow out of or if he just might be a better fit with someone else. 

TLDR: I have a new cat that bit me on my face while I was holding him, unprovoked, snuggled on me and purring. The bites were hard enough to break the skin and bleed. Is this typically a sign of an aggressive cat or could be outgrow it? ",2024-03-28 13:14:24

my cat keeps wanting to go outside (please help i need advice),"i'm a semi new cat parent. i got my cat late sept 2022 and now he's gonna turn 2 this summer. for as long as i've had him, he's been an indoor cat. my only cat! 

for as long as i can remember i have been safely opening the window for him to get some fresh air & also keep him entertained. he loves it. and sometimes a stray cat will perch on the other side and they will just sniff eachother lol. i thought they were friends until one day she tried to fight him. before this he only wanted to stay indoors. anytime he was curious to go out he wouldn't go far and would whine 10 minutes after (he always left without us knowing). now, he wants to stay out longer and gets VERY upset when we don't let him leave. any chance he gets he runs outside. first time i saw him for an extended time he was with that same stray cat (i wish i can adopt her but unfortunately i am unable atm).

He is neutered. he also is fed twice a day and gets plenty of treats/ water. i got him a new cat scratcher too and ive been trying to play with him when i can to get him tired out. 

still, he wants to go outside. luckily right now its mostly the back area that's mostly closed off but it has our driveway, a small back house, and an old playground / tool shed. there isn't really much but on the other side of our house is a busy street and it's very easy for cats to wonder off there. i've tried harnessing him bc i wouldn't mind outdoor walks but he HATES them and will just roll around trying to kick it off (i keep worrying he will accidentally hurt himself)


i'm just really worried. i don't want him to be unhappy but going outside isn't very safe. idk if he even has the shots to go outside (he has all vaccines and indoor cat needs). 

anyone who has had experience with this, what do you recommend? 

posting this here bc in other cat reddits i seem to just get ignored :( ",2024-03-28 08:55:25

Pet Flea and tick treatment,"The vet has always provided spoton. The last time BraVecto was prescribed.
My opinion is these are dangerous chemicals, sad to put on cat, but without the chemicals I would not have a cat.
No issues with the first application, I only had 2.
However the 2nd application was impossible to remove the screw top.
Quite strong, used tissue, could not pull the sucker off.
I realised I would need to cut, and the nightmare that could unfold.
I cut a tiny corner trying not to squeeze at all.
It was everywhere before I realised.
Worse, trying to wash off, it creates a robust film on your skin.
I have a vinegar and dishwasher liquid that we trust to clean everything.
Zero effect, in panic had to think, I used a handful of salt 2X to basically exfoliate  my skin.
Never realised why women like exfoliation, silky smooth.
But, still residue.
If the vet cannot get spoton, with the reliable snap off top, I will change vets
Completely unacceptable to be exposed to these chemicals I cannot fully remove, which require better engineered screw off tops.
I imagine the absorption is very effective, developed in labs by people in white coats. Yes I had gloves I did not use included, big regret.
For me the design is appallingly dangerous.

"Saying goodbye to our Dog tomorrow, trying to get an idea of what my other dog is sensing","My dog Momo, 18, is declining. The last month we’ve seen it really speed up. She will be “going to a farm in upstate New York” tomorrow in an in-home appointment. We are heartbroken to lose a family member but know this is the best for her. No more pain. 

The last week our other pup, Louie (15 ish?) started sitting in front of her, butt in face or hovering right around her. Mostly just sitting right in front of her, backed up to her chest almost touching his butt. They face out into the room. He kind of looks like he’s “protecting” her. 

They’ve been together for at least the last 13ish years. Louie is very anxious in general. 

Is this just dogs being dogs or is there any substance to this behavior? Can he sense what’s going on? (We do plan to have him there at the event to sniff and put it together on his own.) 

Thanks in advance! ",2024-03-28 07:26:33

Why Cats Sleep All the Time,"Cats, those enigmatic and elegant creatures, have mastered the art of relaxation in a way that often leaves their human counterparts envious. With their penchant for perpetual slumber, cats seem to navigate through life with an unparalleled commitment to lounging. But why do they sleep so much? Let's unravel the mystery behind feline sleep habits.  
  
Firstly, it's important to understand that cats are crepuscular animals, meaning they are most active during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk. This evolutionary trait stems from their roots as hunters. By being active during times when their prey is also bustling about, cats maximize their chances of a successful hunt. Consequently, they may appear to sleep excessively during the daylight hours, a pattern that can seem peculiar to diurnal humans.  
  
However, it's not just the timing of their activity that influences their sleep patterns; it's also the efficiency with which they sleep. Cats are remarkably adept at achieving deep, restorative sleep within shorter periods. Like humans, they cycle through various sleep stages, including light sleep, deep sleep, and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. However, cats can enter REM sleep more quickly than humans, making their naps incredibly rejuvenating.  
  
Additionally, a cat's sleep habits are heavily influenced by its environment and lifestyle. Indoor cats, for example, tend to sleep more than their outdoor counterparts. This can be attributed to reduced stimulation indoors and the absence of the need to hunt for food. Indoor cats often find themselves with ample time for extended naps. Outdoor cats, on the other hand, may have a more sporadic sleep schedule, punctuated by periods of activity and rest.  
  
Moreover, cats are masters of energy conservation. They have a remarkable ability to gauge when it's time to conserve energy and when it's time to pounce. Cats will often sleep when not actively engaged in hunting, playing, or exploring their territory. This strategic approach to rest ensures they're ready to spring into action when the opportunity arises.  
  
Age is another significant factor in a cat's sleep schedule. Kittens and senior cats, in particular, tend to sleep more than their adult counterparts. Kittens require ample rest for growth and development, much like human babies. Senior cats, on the other hand, may sleep more due to age-related factors such as decreased mobility and energy levels. For them, sleep becomes not just a luxury but a necessity for maintaining health and vitality.  
  
Their ability to relax and recharge isn't just a quirk; it's a vital component of their overall well-being. So the next time you find your feline companion curled up for yet another nap, remember, they're simply embracing their innate feline instincts. And perhaps, there's a lesson to be learned from their art of leisure – a reminder to slow down, savor the moment, and indulge in the simple pleasures of life.",2024-03-28 06:59:03

Should Cats with fleas take Baths?,"I know this is always a discussion whether Cats should or shouldn’t have baths since Cats do maintain themselves but recently I’ve noticed my dogs have a lot more fleas than usual and they are indoor dogs.

So my question is, is giving the Cat a bath going to harm him at all, I’ve tried the safer flea repellent but haven’t really worked well and I’m worried about using any other stronger flea repellent. Thanks again!

Therefore, I'm not considering getting another guinea pig. Can you suggest any other rodent pets that are easy to care for and have robust health? I would appreciate advice from knowledgeable individuals.",2024-03-28 01:39:03

"TAMPA,FL / WESLEY CHAPEL,FL / LAND O LAKES, FL AFFORDABLE VETERINARY CLINICS","Hi all, I went to a clinic to get my cats vaxxed and was told my male cat Shadow had some tartar build up and should get a dental cleaning, but they quoted me for almost $800. I can't afford that right now, but I also don't want him developing any dental diseases.    
Additionally, my sister's dog needs to be Spayed, and probably get an allergy test, because she's always scratching herself and has a bit of a flare up on her skin. She took her to a vet before and they think she's allergic to chicken and/or grains. However, I've researched enough to know that dogs are rarely allergic to grains, and mostly the specific protein, potentially developing heart/liver issues silently by giving them a grain-free diet. I know research on the internet can sometimes be biased or incorrect tho. 

I've worked at a vet clinic before as a technician a few years ago in Puerto Rico, so the prices would be very different. Any input and estimate of what you paid would be very helpful. Thank you all in advance!",2024-03-28 01:21:38

What to get doggie daycare for going away present?,"Hi everyone!  
TLDR; what should I get the BEST DOGGIE DAYCARE EVER as a going away/thank you present?  
Okay now story/bragging time.  
My girl has been going to a doggie daycare since 2019, and her last day is quickly approaching in May. Since we have been with them for so long, and they have been loyal to us, I would like to get them something or do something for them. They always work with me, and work her in if I ever need anything last minute. They have even offered to watch her alone when she has had a surgery on her eye! They are very accommodating, and their customer service towards me has been wonderful.  
I started sending her when I got her my sophomore year of college, and now I am graduating with my masters degree. I literally wouldn't have been able to graduate from both and have my dog at the same time!  
I know I am going to struggle A LOT without having them. My dog is selective. Since she has been there since she was a fully vaccinated puppy, she is used to the people and some dogs. I worry I will have to switch to a dog walker once I move.  
All that being said, what should I get the BEST DOGGIE DAYCARE EVER as a going away/thank you present?",2024-03-28 00:25:08

When to euthanise dog with lymphoma,"My 11 year old kelpie was diagnosed with lymphoma in November 2023. We tried about 10 rounds of chemo with no success. She’s been on oral steroids for about a month now (since stopping chemo). She’s still pretty active and has no obvious medical issues right now. Her tumours are quite big (especially in her neck). 
I walk her every day off lead and throw a tennis ball for her. Yesterday was the first time she just kept walking with the ball, she didn’t put it down to throw it very often, even when I asked her to. She is normally a crazy active dog and obsessed with the ball. I’m not sure if this is a sign that I should let her go. 
I don’t want to let her suffer, and I know that a day too early is better than a day too late.

My dog suddenly can’t walk anymore,"My dog is 12 years old and on Monday morning she couldn’t get up anymore. She was crying and would try to get up but fall.

The vet gave her medicine but it was too strong which resulted in her sleeping all day and being groggy. Has anyone experienced this? It’s so hard to grasp because on Sunday she was running around and now she can’t walk. We want to take her to an orthopedic but I’m not sure if that’s the right move.

Will I be wrong to separate my cats and take one overseas with me along with the dog?,"Hello, everyone. My mother and I recently agreed that we will move to Japan next year to be closer to my sister. In total, we have three pets. I have a dog (Russia) and a cat (Tom Hanks), and my brother has a cat named Shadow. Our cats are both brothers, although they were not born in the same litter. The cats get along really well, and I'm concerned if I take Tom and Russia with me, Shadow will be left alone. At first, I intended to leave the dog in America, but my brother does not care for or spoil him as my mother and I do. He would most likely breed and sell him.

My other question is whether it would be too stressful for them to accompany me? My cat is only eight months old, but the dog is three years old. I don't want to stress them out, but neither do I want to give them up because they're my babies.

A LITTLE EXTRA CONTEXT: I was gifted Tom as a kitten in the earlier parts of last year as a birthday present from my brother’s girlfriend. At that time we were already in the planning stage of moving and we already had our dog. In December of 2023 my brother came back with an another kitten aka Shadow, he didn’t tell anyone he was coming back with another cat until he FaceTimed me on the road. My cat is 8 months old while his is 3 months old they get along together but they’re not bonded ",2024-03-27 19:08:32

How do I give medicine to my dogs?,"I've got two dogs and giving pills is a very hard job for me to do. I have tried making it powdered and put on top of milk/food. I have tried directly putting it inside their mouth, but they keep spitting it out. I tried making a hole in a biscuit and keeping the pill inside and giving. Even tried powdering it, put in a syringe, added water and press it inside their mouth. Nothing seems to work
Could you share some other I ideas?

Edit: the medicine I have to give in the morning they are spitting it out but the one I have to give in the evening they eat just fine. I guess it's because the morning pill is having an awfully distinct taste. + Didn't try with cheese( don't have it with me ) I tried the putting in mouth,closing, rubbing throat method but as soon as the medicine is in they give no time to keep the mouth shut, so that didn't work. The panicking after pretending to drop food didn't work either.

The one that does work in the evening is keeping the pill inside a small piece of chicken/fish (cooked). I think because the piece is very small they think I can't hide anything, if they still dont eat it I keep it on the floor and they come and eat it right away. ( Didn't powder it,just kept it exactly as it is)

And thanks to everyone for all the methods !

Edit: the medicine I have to give in the morning they are spitting it out but the one I have to give in the evening they eat just fine. I guess it's because the morning pill is having an awfully distinct taste. + Didn't try with cheese( don't have it with me ) I tried the putting in mouth,closing, rubbing throat method but as soon as the medicine is in they give no time to keep the mouth shut, so that didn't work. The panicking after pretending to drop food didn't work either.

The one that does work in the evening is keeping the pill inside a small piece of chicken/fish (cooked). I think because the piece is very small they think I can't hide anything, if they still dont eat it I keep it on the floor and they come and eat it right away. ( Didn't powder it,just kept it exactly as it is)

And thanks to everyone for all the methods !

Dog nose still bleeding ,"My standard poodle ran into my other dog in the yard and she started bleeding from the nose, we took her to the vet once and they gave her medicine to promote clotting which seemed to do the trick for about a week until she moved around hard enough and activated it again. I took her to the vet today for the second time and the doctor says that it's strange for her to be bleeding still. 

The doctor found her blood platelets low and another sign of something else in her blood which happens to be a tick issue. 

My main concern is that she is still bleeding from her nose and he did not really solve the issue the second time. I am giving her Doxyline and Prednisone as they prescribed but my worry is that she is still bleeding. 

I'm thinking about visiting a different vet. What should I do?

Possible tracheal collapse? ,"Our 13yo mixed breed dog is experiencing fairly frequent drawn-out dry coughs since the last couple of weeks or so. It seems mostly similar to the honking sound of tracheal collapse that I found online. 

It is much better when she is sleeping. It does not seem directly connected with physical activity. She wears a collar, but it's not too tight, and we never put a leash on her. 

The thing is, she experienced this exact issue in November 2022. The same kind of cough. It went away after about a month. We did give her dextromethorphan, but it didn't seem to have any immediate effects. 

In the intervening year, I've observed her coughing only when she uses her rear legs to scratch herself. She would cough without fail every time she scratched. 

Before you ask, for various reasons it's next to impossible to take her to a vet. Feeding her medicines is a Herculean task itself.

Could this be tracheal collapse? It sounds very much like it, but given how it resolved itself... It might be worth noting that seasons are changing here, and the weather is constantly fluctuating between dry heat, damp high heat, and damp moderate heat. November is also a time when the weather changes.

Why do cats jump in front of you when you're carrying something big?,"I think I ask cat questions at this point to understand why my grandma's cat does the stuff he does because to me, it seems like he does really dumb stuff. 

But whenever I'm carrying something like my laundry basket, my grandma's cat will purposely jump in front of me, then I accidentally kick him, and I also almost fall because I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and am losing mobility in my right leg. He does this to my grandma as well and she has limited mobility and can't walk without a walker or cane. And he will run and jump right in front of us and either walk slow or stop. 

Does he want me to kick him? Is he trying to trip and hurt me and my grandma? Do cats like being kicked? I don't wanna hurt the little turd. 

My two Chihuahuas, even the blind one, make sure to stay out of the way. ",2024-03-27 11:56:26

Natural flea and tick prevention ,"Before I get torn apart in the comments (I’ve seen how people on Reddit feel about this topic), my boy had a seizure 2 weeks after having flea and tick medication. A very intense Grand Mal seizure at that. So, we are no longer putting him on flea/tick/heartworm prevention medication.
I will reassess in the future if he continues to be seizure free as I understand the benefit to flea/tick/heartworm medication. But, this was only a few months ago so still way too soon in my opinion.

He will continue to get his vaccines, one of which includes a Lyme disease vaccine. 

Does anyone have effective methods/products for flea and tick prevention? Also from what I’m reading, for heartworm, all we can do is a blood test a few times a year to check if he has it. 
Any suggestions are greatly appreciated :) ",2024-03-27 11:36:08

Why Cats Sleep All the Time?,"Cats, those enigmatic and elegant creatures, have mastered the art of relaxation in a way that often leaves their human counterparts envious. With their penchant for perpetual slumber, cats seem to navigate through life with an unparalleled commitment to lounging. But why do they sleep so much? Let's unravel the mystery behind feline sleep habits.

Firstly, it's important to understand that cats are crepuscular animals, meaning they are most active during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk. This evolutionary trait stems from their roots as hunters. By being active during times when their prey is also bustling about, cats maximize their chances of a successful hunt. Consequently, they may appear to sleep excessively during the daylight hours, a pattern that can seem peculiar to diurnal humans....",2024-03-27 11:35:21

Struggling with Senile Pup,"Hi, all. My 16 year old dog has been senile the last year and a half- we believe he's had a few strokes due to end stage heart failure. His senility is only getting more pronounced (being confused, peeing in his diaper in his kennel overnight, facing the back of the kennel in the morning when being let out, doesn't care for affection, ignores us 99% of the time) which has lead to incessant yelping in the early mornings. We have a newborn and made the decision to get a humane bark collar (beeps after one bark, vibrates after second bark, lightly shocks after third bark) to encourage him to be quiet. He's still barking...he gets the light shock, stops, and starts again. He's not registering the pattern and it's heartbreaking. 

This new issue with him not registering the bark collar, coupled with the rest of his behavior and heart disease, is making me believe the humane thing to do is to help him cross the rainbow bridge, but it doesn't feel right. I assume this is what it feels like with every fur baby when the time is presenting itself.

I just feel like I'm keeping my dog alive, but he's not living well, despite being oblivious to everything and having energy 5 minutes a day.

If you have words of wisdom to share, I'd appreciate it .",2024-03-27 09:21:28

Title: Heartbroken and Needing Advice,"Hi everyone, I'm new here and hoping this is the right place for some support.  If there's a more appropriate subreddit, please let me know!

This is incredibly difficult to write, but I'm looking for both advice and support as I navigate a heartbreaking situation with my dog.  She's my entire world, and I'm at a loss.

My sweet girl is 9 years old, but for the past year and a half, she's been battling a collapsed trachea that causes respiratory distress. Initially, I was told she could live a normal life with it, but that hasn't been the case.

It's been a terrifying ordeal.  We've rushed her to the ER three times in eight months for critical respiratory distress, each time requiring overnight stays for oxygen therapy.  It's awful watching her struggle.  She has these severe coughing fits that turn into panting, and I can only imagine the pain she's in.  They even trigger gagging, but nothing comes up.  The cough suppressants haven't helped at all.  We've done every test and X-ray imaginable, but the vets say there's no cure for the collapsed trachea.

Walks, which were always our favorite thing to do together, are now out of the question because they trigger coughing fits.  We even have to keep her out of the heat for the same reason.  The worst part is, these coughing episodes can happen anytime, even when she's resting.  It feels awful just watching her suffer like this.

I have a vet appointment next week specifically to discuss her quality of life.  The thought of her not being here is unbearable, but I can't bear to see her struggle anymore if there isn’t anything else the vet can do for her. 

For anyone who's had to make the incredibly difficult decision of letting a pet go, how did you know it was the right thing?  What helped you cope with the loss?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2024-03-27 08:16:04

I have a vet appointment next week specifically to discuss her quality of life.  The thought of her not being here is unbearable, but I can't bear to see her struggle anymore if there isn’t anything else the vet can do for her. 

For anyone who's had to make the incredibly difficult decision of letting a pet go, how did you know it was the right thing?  What helped you cope with the loss?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2024-03-27 08:16:04
Title: Heartbroken and Needing Advice,"Hi everyone, I'm new here and hoping this is the right place for some support.  If there's a more appropriate subreddit, please let me know!

This is incredibly difficult to write, but I'm looking for both advice and support as I navigate a heartbreaking situation with my dog.  She's my entire world, and I'm at a loss.

My sweet girl is 9 years old, but for the past year and a half, she's been battling a collapsed trachea that causes respiratory distress. Initially, I was told she could live a normal life with it, but that hasn't been the case.

It's been a terrifying ordeal.  We've rushed her to the ER three times in eight months for critical respiratory distress, each time requiring overnight stays for oxygen therapy.  It's awful watching her struggle.  She has these severe coughing fits that turn into panting, and I can only imagine the pain she's in.  They even trigger gagging, but nothing comes up.  The cough suppressants haven't helped at all.  We've done every test and X-ray imaginable, but the vets say there's no cure for the collapsed trachea.

Walks, which were always our favorite thing to do together, are now out of the question because they trigger coughing fits.  We even have to keep her out of the heat for the same reason.  The worst part is, these coughing episodes can happen anytime, even when she's resting.  It feels awful just watching her suffer like this.

My birds don’t like men,"I’m open to any advice regarding how to solve this. 
I have 2 female cockatiels and both of them are absolute sweethearts. They love pets and cuddles from both me and my mom but because of my older brother they have become extremely cautious and sometimes aggressive towards men. How do I help them be more comfortable? I have 2 little brothers that want to be much closer to the birds but they aren’t warming up. 
For more context, my older brother (20 y/o) is very unstable. Without getting into too much detail about his life, he has a very violent past. He likes to fake punch the birds and laughs when they squawk and try to bite him. It hailed recently and he started shaking the bird’s cage while screaming. I’ve told him to stop or at least to do research about how it affects the birds but every time he refuses.
I want the birds to feel safe with my little brothers but the boys don’t want to get bitten. 
Thank you in advance for any help I receive!",2024-03-27 06:32:33

Would a cat swallowing a tiny bit of onion be enough to cause vomiting?,"My cat (2/m) just vomited 3x within the past 30 min. His appetite/behaviour has been normal all day and there was very little vomit each time (1 tsp the first time, 1/2tsp second time, just a few drops the third time). There was nothing but liquid of a thicker consistency than water but it was orangey and transparent each time. In the first bit of vomit, there was what looked like maybe 1 cm of the outermost layer of an onion?  
  
Which could be as I was dicing an onion yesterday or the day before (I try to check the floors multiple times after but it's not impossible I could've missed a bit)  
  
Anyhow, let's say he swallowed that much of an onion- would it be enough to cause him to vomit? 

* Since he (assumedly) vomited it up now, should things be mostly okay? 
* Should I give him dinner (which is in half an hour from now) or wait a certain amount of time since his last bit of vomiting?",2024-03-27 06:00:34

My dog’s nails are terrible and I feel horrible about it,"I (Teen) have owned my dog for all 8 years of his life. He is my best friend, but not my family’s unfortunately. I’ve done my best to take care of him and of course I’ve had help to chip in with his health and going to the vet over the years. But his nails are horribly long, and I’ve recently realized his dew claw is a bit swollen. Whenever we try to cut his nails he is absolutely not having it without the worst fight of my life. He’s been acting completely a-okay, not even excessive licking (at least, not for him— he has always consistently licked/groomed at himself). But still I feel horrible— he’s the sweetest, aggressively loving dog and I’m scared that his nails/dewclaw situation are a sign of how bad of a dog owner I am. 

I’m going to pull together some money from my job and ask to take him to the vet within at least the next 2 weeks in order to prevent (or cure) infection and get his nails cut. My poor baby :(. At least he doesn’t seem to be hurting.",2024-03-27 05:48:02

Ikea's Sweet Ads Capture the Messy Realities of Pet Ownership,"Cats and dogs have an unfortunate tendency to wreak havoc on furniture and other household items. An adorable Ikea campaign assures consumers that its products are so affordable, they don’t have to stress about replacing anything their pet destroys.
The campaign, by agency Ingo Hamburg, shows various Ikea products in disrepair after animals have ruined them. A cat licks up coffee from a shattered Färgrik mug, a puppy sits on a couch looking innocent with a shredded Kärleksgräs cushion at its feet and a Dalmatian sniffs around a shattered Stilren vase.

Cheapest way to get gabapentin and prozac for my cats,"Hi! I need meds for my cats but they're so expensive straight from the vet. I tried to order gabapentin from petcarerx but since it's a controlled substance it wouldn't let me. But it's so much cheaper on there a fraction of the price.  
What suggestions do you have for where or how to get their meds cheaper?   
they have anxiety and are peeing everywhere and fighting because of it, so I need these meds. ",2024-03-27 05:18:10

DIY cat partition - not a baby gate please,"My cats are sisters that I've had for 8 years together. Suddenly, they are fighting and peeing everywhere (see my post history if you think you can help that situation but they’re not getting engagement!) and have to be separated while trialing prozac. We are currently looking to build a partition with an easy sliding/easy access door so they can at least both be out in the large living room but separate. This is about 6 feet across so a regular door like the baby gates or cat doors that are sold won’t work. It also has to be high enough that they can’t climb/jump and not built so they can accidentally choke themselves between bars. How can we DIY this? I added a photo of the living room. It’s high ceiling so I’m thinking of literally a giant sliding door type of partition.

CBD and prozac for cats?,"  
My cats are sisters that I've had for 8 years. All of a sudden, they're fighting, peeing everywhere outside of the box. They now have to be separated while trialing prozac. (please see my post history if you think you can help I have other posts detailing this situation but they're not getting engagement!)  
Has anyone had success with prozac? Gabapentin worked for a little bit then stopped working.   
Has anyone had success with CBD? I bought the paste from Ellevet and it's coming this weekend. Please help!.

Do I uproot my entire life to keep my pets?,"Im a 25m and I live in florida, A year ago I moved from up north to escape a DV relationship and had to rehome my 2 tabby cats to my sister. She has no issues taking care of them and recently lost her own cat so she was more then happy to take them in for the time being. Fast forward to this year and she is moving to a new complex that only lets her have 2 cats max and she has since gotten another cat. She told me this weekend that she is moving in 2 months, and if I had any plans of getting them back or would I like her to rehome them. I lucked out into an office admin job granted I only make 40k a year so its not life changing money especially for my area. I have a friend of mine that I lived with up north who lives 5 hours away from me that is looking for an apartment and has lived with my cats in the past and loves them. I currently live with my lifelong best friend who is deathly allergic to cats and pay $650 a month in rent. I would be paying $800 with utilities at the new apartment. I am afraid that my best friend will be upset with me as we had a falling out with another roommate who had a drug problem and money was tight so I offered to pay more per month as I could afford it, and now I would be gone leaving him making roughly what I do (no lease involved) My friend who id be living with 5 hours is a manager at a surveying company and could get me a job right away making an extra $3 an hour, granted it will be a lot different work then ill be doing now. I feel lost, I raised my cats from kittens and fed them bottles since 4 weeks old and this year without them has been really tough on my mental health. They are 100% emotional support animals and I would scrub toilets' to live with them again, but on the opposite end I am paying next to nothing in rent doing a job where I ACTUALLY work roughly 10 hours max a week and get paid for 40.

TLDR: Do I leave my childhood best friend (deathly allergic) who relies on me to help with rent and helped me beat homeless and DV a year ago to move across my state to be able to live with my cats again after a year without them (I'm not on a lease or contract)

So I’m looking for a foldable metal gate that I can attach permanently to one side of the wall and attach the other side on hooks so when not in use I can unhook and fold it again the other wall.

Is this animal abuse (Help),"i wanna keep this short, My sister Randomly and Without warning brought home a rabbit, and (Mind this) wants us to take care of it for her. Let me give you a rundown of our situation.

 So i wanna make it clear that we are a 6 person family that lives in a Very Small and Crowded Apartment to the point where you can't walk 3 feet straight before hitting smth, Not only that but **EVERYONE excluding me and my 9 year old little brother has a job. Nonetheless I am also extremely busy as i have to clean the house, take care of my lil brother, study for my final highschool exam and other things/projects.** And now I have to take care, love, play, and train a rabbit that I never asked for. My sister only takes care of it 1 or 2 times a week, the rest is me. And not only that but she absolutely Does Not Know how to take care of a rabbit, barely even knows the basics and rarely if ever does any research on how to take care of one. **I already don’t have time for anything anymore**

**The rabbit is 3 months old, Lop eared rabbit.**

Now on the rabbit's condition, it will be listed below:

- Eats, Drinks, Sleeps, and Lives in its own Shit & Piss, having the cage (not the rabbit) cleaned every 2-4 days.
- Stays in a cage for 24 hours straight (Not an exaggeration), only being let out for 10 - 30 minutes the Whole Day.
- Keeps constantly sneezing and itching itself for 4-5 Days straight now, with my sister Denying the possibility that he is sick, only recently being (mildly) concerned But still does nothing.
- Gets denied attention and affection for the whole day because we are busy (Note that I Really do try my best to give it all the love it deserves when I have time).
- We don’t have the right Skills, Equipment, or facilities to take care of the rabbit
- It does nothing but sleep and stare at nothing.
- ⁠I’m afraid that it is not eating the right amount.

**Please tell me that I'm right in that this is just straight up animal abuse, we have had it for around a week and a half now and everything is driving me insane. Thanks.**",2024-03-27 02:21:49

Shy Cat,"We had a cat and recently he died. So after 3 months my parents and I decided that we want to have another one. 
So we went to the animal shelter and found a 5 year old girl. The biggest ""problem"" is, that she is very shy. 
Because we can't adopt her until May, I want to visit the shelter a few times to get mor familiar with her. 

Do you have any tips on how to get her to trust me while the other cats are around? 

I know that this will take well over a month to get her to trust me, but I guess it's better than nothing to start now. ",2024-03-27 00:19:43

Need Advice Epileptic Pet,My dog has had Epilepsy going on 3 years. He currently takes 1000 Mg of Kepra and 64.8 mg of Phenobarbital every 12 hours. He was originally just on Kepra until December when he had cluster seizures. He used to at most just have seizures at most 2 a month but now it’s once a week. Our vet is adamant that we get an MRI. Our dog shows no other signs of something being wrong with his brain though and his blood work always comes back perfect . We have changed his diet to involve more salmon. But I am honestly at a loss of what to do. Unfortunately we don’t really have $5000 for an MRI and I’ve been told that since our dog has had seizures for 3 years with no other symptoms it most likely isn’t a tumor. Any advice on how to further reduce his seizures would be much appreciated our vet is against upping his medication any further and even wanted to take him off the Kepra eventually. It’s honestly just frustrating as I don’t know anyone with a dog that has epilepsy so I don’t know what’s normal or not. Like is it normal before seizures that he starts pacing and walks into stuff? Is it normal that even though he’s medicated his seizures happen once a week?,2024-03-26 22:58:49

"My pup got diagnosed with mitral valve disease, looking for how to cope, what to do next, stories about your dog living a long and happy life with this disease","
My dog has had a heart murmur for years, all vets I’ve been to tell me every time we visit, I’ve known it for a long time, maybe since she was 3 or 4, but nobody ever recommended to do anything about it, since it’s been low grade 1/2 since she was diagnosed.
Last week I brought her into my vet to take a look at a tooth to see if we needed to schedule a dental, and he listened to her heart and suggested we get an echo, so we did.

She was diagnosed with a low grade mitral valve issue, he didn’t say specifically but I’m thinking we are in B1, he said it’s not time to do anything besides monitor her at home and while exercising to see if she’s slowing down/can’t get comfortable.
As of right now she has no symptoms, and she’s 9 years old. Turning 10 in November.

She is my heart dog, my best friend, the dog I got when I was 17 and grew into an adult with, who moved with me from apartment to apartment, who’s been with me through everything, we are each other’s emotional support and I can’t imagine my life without her, and I am praying that we can manage this for a long time. But I’ve read how devastating this disease is, I’ve seen my mom’s dog go through it and eventually lead to CHF. And I’m terrified of what could possibly happen, she’s the most perfect dog in the world and she doesn’t deserve this and I haven’t stopped crying since I found out and I just want to know if this is the beginning of the end or if there is any hope at all to her living  long happy normal life",2024-03-26 22:09:32

Canary breeding : empty eggs,"Good morning. I have a question for those who know canaries. I have two 4 year old females and a exactly 1 year old male. The females have laid eggs and have been nesting for 10 days. I thought the eggs were fertilized because they interacted with the male, but the eggs are empty. Could it be that the male is still too young? He is only one year old. Thanks ",2024-03-26 17:57:03

"First time owner, worried my dog literally hates/ is tired of me..","I have a three-year-old boxer, her name is Daisy, she a really hyperactive pup, all thoughout the day she loves to run, exercise, play, chase, bark..you name it, I’ve always called her crazy Daisy for her real rambunctious energy. 
She turned three in February and I’ve noticed a slight different on how she’s acting…some have told me she’s “maturing” but it’s kind of hard to see it that way. One thing about Daisy is that she’s ALWAYS been clingy, ALWAYS by my side. Everyday after work when I come home, I go outside to hang with her, she either sits next to me, lies next to me or rubs against me like a cat. BUT recently I’ve noticed she keeps preferring to chill in her kennel… i’ve tried dog treats and even new toys. She comes out for a few minutes but when she eats the treat she’ll hang with me for a bit and then go back to her crate, and with the toys she’ll play and then she’ll take them back to her crate after a few minutes of playing, sometimes she just grabs the toy/treat and goes straight to her crate. We always leave it open, inside she has a bed and it’s covered with blankets, so I get that it’s cozy in there, but this is so unlike her. Did I annoy her? Does she hate me? Is this common with anybody else’s dog? Do they go thru these fazes like a 13yr old locking herself in their room? I don’t get it, she still gets excited when she sees me, and she’s eating/ drinking water fine…I just need help? She has a vet appointment soon and I’m scared to stress her by taking her away from her kennel for a long period of time…pls if anybody has answers! ",2024-03-26 12:47:46

Dog has pneumonia. Pet insurance question!,"I am going to get pet insurance for my 7 year old dog. He has pneumonia which is the first time he’s had any health issue and it was a wake up call for us realizing it could have been something worse (and more costly)

Here’s my question. The diagnosis is pneumonia. I understand the insurance will not cover anything related to that as an existing condition, that’s fine. If I get pet insurance today, and we go to our next vet check up in 3 weeks and it’s not pneumonia, it’s actually heart failure or cancer something more severe, is THAT a pre existing condition? I think no, right? Like right now, it’s pneumonia? If we find out otherwise later that’s a new issue? ",2024-03-26 11:44:20

Carecredit vs a regular credit card for vets,"I've been thinking about getting carecredit for vet bills, just for the luxury of not taking a huge cash hit all at once.

Helping pets greive,"We have a dog, Maggie, who is an almost 10 year old bull mastiff. About a month ago she has started having seizures, went on meds, and was doing better. I felt 2 large lumps in her neck and took her to the vet where they found enlarged lymph nodes all over her body. They are thinking cancer and took samples to send. I know her time is coming soon.

We also have three cats one of whom, Dave, loves Maggie. Like very in love. They cuddle together, sleep together, go on walks together everything.  She is his world. 

If it comes down to making an appt to have Maggie put down should we plan to bring Dave with us? He would be devastated if she just left and never came back. Would seeing her and smelling her after help him understand she's gone?

Is my dog getting tan or is it something else? ,"Genuine question, I’m sure it sounds stupid, but I’m in search of answers. A few weeks ago, my wife and I moved from Las Vegas to the panhandle of Florida. We have a little (almost) 2 year old dachshund/wiener/jack russel/chihuahua mix (he’s a mutt) and man does he love to play and he’s got a ton of energy all the time. We had an apartment in Vegas with a tiny patio with artificial turf that we let him go to the bathroom out there and do whatever he wanted but it was always in the shade. The sun quite literally never hit the patio ever. So the only time he really got sun was the 30min to 1hr we took him to the park every other day. When we moved to FL, we bought a house with a huge backyard where it gets tons of sun and he is loving it. Spends most of his time outside running around and basking in the sun. A few days ago, my wife pointed out that his skin looks darker thru his hair. Especially the back of his ears, his sides, and oddly enough his butthole literally got darker. He hasn’t lost any hair, not shedding more than usual, his energy is the same, he’s all around the exact same dog just tan lol. I’ve asked a few friends that are have experience training and dealing with dogs and they haven’t heard of anything adverse from this or even heard of it. Just wondering is that’s something we should take him to the vet for, something we should be on the lookout for, or if anyone else’s dog just got “tan” like ours? It sounds crazy I’m sure, but it got me wondering. I could just as easily google this but Reddit communities are way better imo. Thanks in advance! ",2024-03-26 09:51:16

Please help me what can be done??

I don't think there is issue with the cat, because of there was then it would be peeing all over the house during other times as well and not just early morning. 


Also it is summer here, there are 2 other cats same age as of her. One male cat bullies her and this cat bullies the other cat.

Cat lost her claw,"Forgive me- I’m a first time cat owner & adopted a 4 year old cat from the shelter who they didn’t think could be an inside cat; so she took a while to come out of her shell. Shes the sweetest girl now & comes out of hiding when there’s food involved (or if you enter the kitchen at all😂😂). 

I had a pizza delivered and sat on the couch and she smelled it and got excited and started kneading on the couch & one of her nails got stuck. I went to help her get unstuck and it fell off. :( 

I’ve read that cats shed nails, so this might be normal, but as a dog mom - I was spooked! 😂 

P.s. - I had an appt to get her into the groomer for her nails. With her being an adult, formerly feral cat, I’d like her first nail trim to be done by a professional. I had scheduled an appointment a few weeks ago but needed my car windshield replaced/oil leak fixed and couldn’t transport her in my rental car.

I had scheduled an appointment a few weeks ago but needed my car windshield replaced/oil leak fixed and couldn’t transport her in my rental car.

Cat lost her claw,"Forgive me- I’m a first time cat owner & adopted a 4 year old cat from the shelter who they didn’t think could be an inside cat; so she took a while to come out of her shell. Shes the sweetest girl now & comes out of hiding when there’s food involved (or if you enter the kitchen at all😂😂). 

I had a pizza delivered and sat on the couch and she smelled it and got excited and started kneading on the couch & one of her nails got stuck. I went to help her get unstuck and it fell off. :(

Question about cat vaccinations,"Hello! I recently adopted a cat (2 years old, female, not spayed yet). According to her previous owner, she received her vaccines but won’t give me any information or records about it. I’m wondering if it would be harmful for my cat to get the vaccinations again? I live in a college apartment dorm and in order to have her registered as an ESA here I need to provide them with her vaccination documents. The previous owner stopped replying to me which is why I can’t get the documents or any information. Thanks for any input!

Cat not using the litter box,"Hello! I have a 9 y/o cat that I’m having currently issues with whom is choosing to go to the bathroom outside of her litter box.

To give a bit of background information, I’ve had her since she was 3-4 months old. When we lived with my parents, there was another cat there which had health problems towards the end of its life and was peeing outside of the litter box—however, I do not know if she learned this bad habit from them or not since I never caught her in the act of not using it while we were both living with them. We eventually moved into a carpeted apartment after I got married, and both my husband and I immediately noticed her marking a certain corner of the unit within the first few weeks of living there. We assumed that another person with a cat had lived there prior to us (and that’s why she was behaving that way) so we made a point to shampoo the carpets several times a week with a special carpet treatment to reduce the smell. We stayed there for several years and eventually moved to a different complex on the other side of town so that we’d both could be closer to work. Now, this new complex was recently built and has zero carpets/is completely hardwood flooring. Things were fine for a few months and we had zero messes from her. However, we took in a stray not that long ago who liked to dive bomb both her and our other cat when they were using one of the four litter boxes we have—and she immediately started to not use them again, regardless of how often we emptied it out.

We finally found a forever home for the stray, however, the 9y/o is still choosing to go to the bathroom on the floor—and we’re at a loss of what to do about it. We’ve already taken her to the vet to try and address the issue, but she has a clean bill of health, and the anxiety medication that they gave her didn’t solve the behavioral problems.

My husband (reasonably so) is tired of the both of us having clean up after her multiple times a day and is mentioning wanting to rehome her. However, she’s been with me for a really long time and I’d like to avoid doing that. Does anyone have any ideas on stuff that we can try to get her to start using the litter boxes again?",2024-03-26 05:41:06

How to travel with a scared cat?,"Hey guys! I am moving soon to a town 3h drive away, and I'm wondering how to take my cat with me.

She is quite a scaredy cat, she has only been in the car a few times, for 20-30 minutes, and she has always been quite freaked out by it, peeing, pooping, vomiting, hyperventilating, meowing frantically. Do you have any tips on how to make the journey easier?

What we tried in the past: getting her used to a carrier at home with snacks, Feliway classic spray in the carrier, some gum rub gel I can't remember the name of, and Neurontin, the vet only recommended half a dose of that, but I did give her a whole 100 mg capsule once (she is a small cat, about 4kg). These sedatives didn't help, they seemed to work on the cat at home, but as soon as we got her in the carrier and we were on the road, the instinct for life came out and everything went back to as it was before.

I'm mainly wondering if a) there are any medications, sedatives (even anaesthetics?) that can be tried, b) if nothing works, what can be expected, will she endure the journey? Will she calm down after a while? Could she be in more serious trouble? If she ""just"" stresses and meows the whole way, we can take it, but I don't want her to get a heart attack... 

Thanks a lot for all the tips!",2024-03-26 04:40:59

Why is pet euthanasia expensive?,"My 11-year-old Yorkie has been dealing with health issues for a year and I've unfortunately come to the hard decision that putting him down would be for the best.

What is a good pet for someone who is chronically ill and owns an apartment?,"I am able to pay for all vet visits. And I am mobile. I just unfortunately have osteoarthritis. I also live with fully mobile people who don't have these issues.

I was just wondering if cats are the best? They are known to heal bones and are so sweet.

I can't have a dog. As much as I love them. Because I don't want to limit it's playtime during a bad flare up.

Hamsters are cool? I've had birds and I love them. But I'm afraid it will accidently fly away (thank God I've never had that happen to me)

Any suggestions?

Again, just to note. I will be able to hang them with everyday. I WFH, so I can groom their fur if needed. Vet visits won't be a problem. And I have a support system if anything happens to me.



edit: I want to take a moment and thank everyone who is taking the time to answer. especially the ones who know what it's like. honestly, going from able bodied to not. especially at such a young age is something not on my bucket list. and I think having a pet companion can be so beneficial 🌟 I appreciate everyone answering me ",2024-03-26 02:12:41

Torn about surrendering my pet,"I got a pet rabbit a few years ago and it took us a long time to bond. To be honest, I still don’t think she fully trusts me.
I have provided her with everything I think she needs, a large carpeted space, a variety of food, water, toys, and plenty of hay and hiding spaces. 
She doesn’t walk on hardwood floors because she slips on it so even though she has the whole place at her disposal, she will only stay on the carpet (I should mention that it takes up half the bedroom so space isn’t an issue).
Now, not long after I got her, I started getting sick and am constantly in and out of hospitals. I also have a surgery planned in the near future. This has prevented me from spending much time with her.
My dilemma is this: I don’t know if my rabbit is happy. I don’t spend as much time with her as I think she needs/deserves and she doesn’t have any other companions.
I want her to have the best life, I just don’t know if she’s getting that with me. If I keep her, I know nothing will change. But if I surrender her, she could find a person or family that will give her more time than I can.
Has anyone else ever been through this? How did you decide?",2024-03-26 01:52:49

Frustrated about cat’s chronic vomiting,"I have a 12 year old cat who has been having episodes of vomiting white foamy bile for about 4-5 months now. He has been to 3 different vets, 5 times. We have done an ultrasound (slight stomach lining swelling, but otherwise normal), blood work (normal), dewormer (no change yet), Cerenia, Prednisolone, Pepcid, and a diet change from chicken base to salmon base.

Nothing has worked. He is not losing weight, but he barely touches his food and he vomits several times daily and nightly, which keeps me up with worry. If he takes Prednisolone he will be fine for a day, but when it runs out he is right back to lethargic and vomiting. I have noticed diarrhea as well, which was full of grass (he goes on the deck. I guess he’s been chewing grass). He does have an appointment next week to have two bad teeth removed, which my vet hopes will help him eat. She isn’t sure if that is causing the entire problem. 

I’m at a loss. I have put a lot of money, time, and energy into this. He is my best friend and I hate to see him feel so sick. Has anyone had anything similar happen, or does anyone have any ideas? Thank you! ",2024-03-26 00:52:41
Frustrated about cat’s chronic vomiting,"I have a 12 year old cat who has been having episodes of vomiting white foamy bile for about 4-5 months now. He has been to 3 different vets, 5 times. We have done an ultrasound (slight stomach lining swelling, but otherwise normal), blood work (normal), dewormer (no change yet), Cerenia, Prednisolone, Pepcid, and a diet change from chicken base to salmon base.

Nothing has worked. He is not losing weight, but he barely touches his food and he vomits several times daily and nightly, which keeps me up with worry.

Advice what would you do in this situation? ,"So I’ve been dog walking a pup that’s about 7 yo for 6 mo now, the dog is very anxious and scared and not trained well, he marks constantly in the house, was not socialized so tries to attack other dogs and small children in public, and will bite even those closest to him if you try and pet him while he’s laying or hold him back from going somewhere he wants to go. Now I’ve noticed that once he bites he will immediately begin shaking as if he’s expecting to get screamed at as if that’s all he knows. (some background on the dog I know his owners never trained him they just put him in training and expected that to be all they needed to do. I have also seen that they just scream at him whenever he’s bad. And that they would do days not walking the dog leaving the pee and poop in their house for me so clean hours later.) Now one parent moved into an apartment with no pets allowed and she’s never asked to or come to see him again in months and the other parent just moved out of the states. They’ve asked me to moved into their former apartment which is very nice and more than I could ever afford without paying rent to take this dog from them and live with him. Now of course I agreed to a nice apartment for free for a few months and I get a new cute dog which yes has some issues but I believe I can help him w patience, lots of love, not leaving alone all day long and showing him I won’t be screaming at him like they did. However I’m now being told they plan on moving back in a few months and plan to take him back is this right? I’m heartbroken as I never agreed to take him in temporarily they never said that either or that they ever wanted to take him back. I don’t think they deserve him the way they treated him and abandoned him, I’m already seeing him turning into a new happier less anxious and scared pup. But again I know they’re letting me live rent free and in their eyes if they’re paying for that it’s their dog still. Any advice on this situation?",2024-03-26 00:50:52

Need help!,"I have a 3.5 y/o mini aussiedoodle who has recently started pooping in the house at night. She is obviously potty trained and I feel she is doing it because she is mad at something?

She doesn't get fed past 6pm and I even take her on walks after dinner (where she poops!) and yet she is still pooping every single night in the house.

Am I overreacting about cat hiding?,"I adopted my cat Boba about 6 months ago. She’s typically pretty social, but will hide when scared, and also when she wants a cozy place to take a nap during the day. Recently she’s been going under our bed more frequently, and luring her out even with her favorite treats and toys is difficult. Once she’s out, she acts totally normal though. She’s playful, eating, drinking and using her litter box normally, and I checked her over visually and felt around different spots to see if she was in pain or injured. Am I overreacting? Is it just normal cat behavior to want to find a cozy, dark spot to sleep? She’s UTD on vaccines and went to the vet less than 2 months ago for an exam.

My friend needs help,"TW// Sui thoughts

My friend has two cats who need a home. She lives near Madison, Wisconsin. She's been technically homeless for a year, living in a friends basement and she can't afford to take care of her cats anymore. Both of her cats are starting to get sick. One has bad breath that is getting worse and the other is throwing up clear foam. She can't afford to take them to the vet. No one she knows can take the cats in. And she's afraid take her cats to a shelter because she's afraid they're gonna put them down because they're sick. 

If there's ANYBODY in Wisconsin that can help her out, it would help her tremendously. She can't work because of serious mental health problems. I worry about her greatly. 😥 She's telling me right now as I type this out that she thinks killing herself is the best option...",2024-03-25 23:24:43

My guinea pig... chuckled?,"I know the title sounds strange, but I'll try to explain as best as I can. (Obligatory mobile, sorry)

Last week my guinea pig made a strange noise when I pet him. It lasted maybe 1 second, so I wasn't sure if I imagined it or not.

Yesterday he did it again when I walked past him. I've had guinea pigs all my life and I've never heard this before (I've heard pretty much all the sounds they make, save for that bird song one that seems very rare).

The best way I can describe it is like a he-he-he kind of laugh. I've tried to replicate it myself but I just can't. He wasn't doing anything, had just finished his veggies for lunch when he made it.

As for his health, he is good and I've not noticed anything abnormal with him at all.

Could this just be another random guinea pig noise, or am I loosing my mind?",2024-03-25 21:51:16

Fast forward a couple months later, I move back in but I still spend a couple of days of the week over there with her and the three kitties. 

I just got back from spending 3 nights at her place to find my blankets soaked in cat pee, one of them being pretty brand new. 
What can I do? I don't wanna punish my cat, but I don't want to keep coming back to pee on my sheets!

Which animal was your pet mistaken with during a walk ? ,"I walk my cat. I know it’s rare those days, but people keep asking me if it’s a cat or a dog (even after coming very close to me) and that’s hilarious.

I saw a video from a corgi owner saying people have mistaken his dogs for… rabbits ?! People are insane.

So, which animals was your pet been mistaken with during a walk ? ",2024-03-25 16:05:10

A stray cat sometimes goes to my backyard where my outdoor Pomeranian is in lately.,"Is this normal or is the cat trying to eat my Pomeranian? they sometimes stare at each other and go to different directions of the backyard, but I have no clue why the same cat still keeps coming",2024-03-25 13:38:22

I feel like we just adopted extra expenses and poop cleaning and getting nothing in return,"We were looking for a cuddly adult cat to adopt. We chose our cat (2yo female, spayed) because she jumped on me and started cuddling me and purred nonstop for at least five minutes. I thought “oh my god it’s finally happening, this cat chose me”. I wanted an affectionate cat and I thought she was that. Even her shelter description said she was extremely affectionate. We bring her home and she was affectionate for two days then suddenly— nothing. It’s been six weeks since we adopted her. The shelter provided her medical records, and there was nothing wrong with her. We’ve also brought her to a vet to see if there was anything wrong with her—nothing. She’s a healthy young cat. It’s been weeeeeeeks since she showed any affection, or even acknowledgement. The few times she would acknowledge me is when she needed food, but we got her an auto feeder so we are pretty much useless to her lol. She doesn’t wanna play, she just wants to sleep all day and when she’s awake, she still would only lay down. We got her all the toys to entertain herself, we try to play with her when we can. She was adopted alongside a 3yo male (he’s a good boy) that she was playing with at the shelter, but now she also ignores him. He tries to play with her but she doesn’t care.


Some people would say “just be patient it took years before my cat became affectionate”. I feel like that’s just not fair. Most people adopt cats for companionship. Yes there are people who volunteer/rescue/foster because they have a lot of love and resources to give to multiple animals. For the majority of cat owners, they only have one or two cats so can they shower them with all the love in the world. I want to do that for my cat, but she doesn’t even acknowledge me. I feel like I’m getting nothing out of this arrangement. Downvote away, but you seriously can’t expect someone to spend time and money on an animal (A PET) and not get anything in return. Is it really realistic to expect someone to wait for months or years for a cat to POSSIBLY be affectionate? It feels like she’s a freeloader lol. I’m sorry but I’m not a martyr. We feed her and keep her safe and try to be good cat parents, but she only eats and lays in her hammock most of the day. Sometimes she would lay somewhere else for a change. That’s the most we get out of her.


I don’t feel a connection with her anymore, but I don’t want rehome her because I understand that it is cruel and traumatizing for them. I am really just so frustrated at this point. How do I get this cat to love me again?",2024-03-25 12:40:16

4 pets in a 2 pet rental,"I am so stressed about this and I need to vent. Please tell me I’m not the only one who has been here??
My boyfriend and I are graduating college next month and moving 3 hours away to a small town shortly afterwards (he got a job). We’ve lived together since 2020 and I took my family’s two dogs with me, as I was the only one who cared for them. The next year, I brought my two cats to live with us as well because every time I visited them, my cats were locked in separate cages with dirty litter boxes, dirty food and water, and dirty matted fur. My parents wanted to get rid of them so we took them. 
I thought small town landlords would be friendlier about pets than big city agencies, but I was wrong. Most rentals didn’t allow pets, much less two large dogs and two cats. Our dogs are also seniors, so we needed a ground floor with a backyard. We found the perfect place but it said no pets allowed. We were able to convince the homeowner by sending him pictures and a description of our dogs along with offering to pay pet fees (on top of 1.6k each month). He approved the dogs, but the cats are a secret so far.
He was hesitant about allowing pets in the first place so I feel terribly nervous and guilty about sneaking in two more, but I feel like I had no choice. There was nowhere to live and we can’t buy a house for at least another year. Getting rid of my pets was not an option and neither was moving 3 hours away without a house to move into…
Because this is a small town I’m also worried about him driving by or stopping in randomly. I’m worried he’ll see the cats in the windows or let himself in or something. I’m so nervous, what do I do?",2024-03-25 12:14:28

Is it Animal-Abuse to have multiple cats in a 2m x 2m cage all day long?,"youtube recommended garbage to me again, but what ive saw was so sadening.  
there is a guy on youtube having 4 cages, i dont know the exact demensions but seems like each has less than 2m x 2m. each cage has 2-4 cats in them and the way he talks i assume they are in these cages their entire life.   


last time i had cats myself was 15+ years ago but my info is cats need lot of space to run, climb, have a way to power themself out. they are predators, hunting mice and birds etc.   
so makes me even more sad that all these cats are locked up.  but what can i do? report it as animal abuse to youtube? they do nothing, not even taking the video down (which wouldnt change the fact that these poor fellas are still trapped) so where to report it to?  


videos in question: (dont watch if you dont want to see cats in a ""clutterers"" care)

maybe im just wrong and all these cats have a beautiful life, he has also some cat videos with ""rescue"" in the name, so maybe he ""want to be"" an animal shelter.. but this shelter doesnt look good to keep cats safe and sound.

Extra affectionate hoarded cat,"  
Hi, 

I have been fostering a hoarded cat for less than a week. He is two years old, very sweet, friendly, and vocal.   
On the first day, he spent all day and night in the closet. On the second day, I set up his litter box, toys, bed, and food in the bathroom. I spent time playing and giving him treats. On day three, he started exploring the house at his own pace. He played with toys and began using his litter box.   
He was very comfortable around me and even cuddled in my bed all night!  
I work from home, so he is around me all day. He talks to me constantly, and he's super friendly. He follows me around all day and jumps on me as soon as I sit on the couch or any chair, cuddling with me until he falls asleep. Wherever I go, he follows and meows. I play with him and reward him with treats. However, I'm concerned because he's not playing on his own much and is always looking for me. I can't help worrying about him when I leave my house for a couple of hours. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? I wonder if he's being clingy, or if this is normal. Should I start training him to be more independent and play on his own or if this is just an adapting phase? 

I don't have much experience with cats, so I'm also not sure how much to feed him. I've been giving him wet food in the morning and leaving a bowl with dry food and water in case he's hungry during the day.   
I'd like to adopt him because I adore him, but I'm not sure if he would be happier at a house with another cat for more company or if I should train him to be more independent. 

Any advice would be appreciated!",2024-03-25 09:24:30

I dont know what to do…,"
First I'm going to apologize for my grammar, English is not my first language so it may not be very well written.

A little context: my dog is 16 years old and he suffers from heart and liver problems, so for 10 months he has been taking three different medications and we have not had any problems so far. About three weeks ago my dog was vomiting and suffered from diarrhea and the vet sended me several medications, which worked for two days and then he suffered from vomiting again (but the diarrhea disappeared). After a second visit, the medications he prescribed were withdrawn because we thought it could be the fault of some medications.

He was fine for a few days but then again suffered from vomiting and he is very depressed, as if he were not the same. Besides, he doesn't want to eat, not even his favorite food or his treats. After a third visit to the vet (in which he was there for 5 hours with a dropper since he had symptoms of dehydration), they gave him a stomach protector thinking that it may be the fault of the large number of medicines he is taking.

It's been 3 days and he doesn't want to eat (I feed him with a syringe because he doesn't leave me any other option), he's still very depressed, and many times he starts to tremble. I don't know what to do and I'm very worried because we've already visited the vet three times and it doesn't get better.",2024-03-25 06:04:14

Flea help please,"Hello. So I have had a problem with biting in the house since September/October last year. I have a toddler and it's getting to a point we are covered in bites. I have had a pest control in that hasn't helped 3 months ago. Up until a month ago I didn't even know what I'm dealing with as I haven't had a single flea/bed bug in a house that we could have seen. I've tried spraying couches mattress carpets.. baking soda.. powders.. sprays..nothing is working. I can't really use a flea bomb as I have toddler that constantly put his hands in his mouth. Please help. We have antibiotic/steroid cream for the bites but its ruining my life and also my toddler is covered in bites on his legs and they started biting his neck and face. I hoover every single day.. I wash bedding twice a week, I keep house clean. What do I do to get on top of this I'm going crazy and the itching! Not to mention how we'll look once it gets warm I don't think I'll even be comfortable wearing a dress with the scars on my legs. I'm at wits end with getting rid of them I just feel like crying at this point. My cat is being regularly fleed can you please give me some ideas that will be safe around my child. I'm willing to buy whatever just to stay on top of it! Please. ",2024-03-25 05:38:00

Science Supports Dog Parents,"It's no secret that a lot of dog owners call their dogs their children. And I've seen a lot of complaints of ""humanizing dogs"" because of this. 

Well, I guess some scientists wanted to settle this debate and did a study and as it turns out, our human brains form a maternal bond with our canine companions. Our brains actually register our dogs as our children. 

As far as humanizing, I mean, so many dogs have jobs. Our brains register them as our kids. I think as long as we can acknowledge that they are another species and nobody is giving a dog a driver's license, everything will be fine. I don't think anyone is trying to humanize dogs, anyway. I think that dogs are a functioning part of society and people are scared that if we accept that, then we humanize the dogs.

AITA for not giving a puppy to my animal abusive aunt and let her try again.,"Im a dog breeder, I only work with 2 breeds, poodles and chihuahuas, and I used to breed cocker spaniels but not anymore. I only have one litter a year, like one year poodles, and the next chi’s. My aunt has been always insisted of me giving her a puppy for free from each litter every year. The thing is, she is one of the most unstable dog owners I know. Ive given her 2 in the past. Never again. I will forever hate myself for what happened to them. Dogs have died in her care. I will write down all the dogs she has had and how they passed or gone “missing”. She currently has 2 dogs in her care and im worried sick for them…

•Luna, poodle,2017- tick infestation got her, she was 5 years old.
•Brownie, yorkie, 2018- rehomed at 7 months old due to potty training issues. He was 2 when a car ran over him.
•Lola, spaniel,2018- she was 2 months old when i gave her to them. She lasted a month before she went “missing”. She was later found dead behind some wooden planks just 15 feet away from their backdoor. Her body was emaciated and thin with signs of trauma on her body. She was only 3 months old.
•Chuchu, AmBulldog,2018- they bought him as a gift for the dad, he quickly grew “too big” and he was quickly rehomed after 4 months old, new owner loved him but had an unstable living and had to surrender him to the shelter at 15 months old.
•Leo, chihuahua mix, 2020- he went “missing” 2 weeks after they bought him along with his sister.
•Bruno, chihuahua,2021- he went “missing” 2 months after she bought him from me. Pretty sure he was killed by ticks. I cried for 2 nights straight after I found out what hell hole I sent him to thinking that she would change.
•Unkown, chihuahua mix,2023- he went “missing” 3 days after they found him wandering the street.
•Piggy, chihuahua mix,2023- she was the sister of Leo and she died via an accidental pregnancy and her puppies were to big for her and she never received medical attention.
•April,poodle mix chihuahua,2023- she was dumped at her place by her sister and she died at the age of 6 by unknown causes.
•Unknown, doodle, 2024- he was bought for their dad again but he didnt “learn how to potty” so they rehomed him after a month to the same person who adopted Brownie years prior. Hes currently 4 months old.
•Unknown, Weimaraner mix, 2024- this is their latest pup, she is a female Weimaraner cross given by a friend. Age unkown but she is a puppy. She is very playful but assuming that she is a large breed, I fear that what happened to Chuchu, will happen to her. 


11 dogs that have fallen into the hands of this aunt and possibly more but these are the main ones that I remember. I will never stop and feel crushed at the sight of their backyard whenever I have to go visit. Thinking about all the poor souls who lost their lives and were doomed after stepping foot inside that property. They do not deserve to have animals but im stuck on what are my options to help their current dogs get out of that situation. All i can do now is pray for those poor souls and try to get justice for them.",2024-03-25 03:26:56

Advice on moving cats from two houses to a new one,"I will be moving in with my girlfriend in the next month or so. She has two cats. I have one. They've never met. I'm looking for some advice on how to get them acclimated to each other in a new location. 

Some info that might help:

Her two are: a small 2 year old female that was born as a barn cat. It doesn't like people and likes to bother the other cat.

A 10 year old big black male who enjoys windows and sleeping. He was dropped off at the humane society after a divorce. He likes some people and tolerates the little one.

My cat is a big black male that's 5 years old. He was also at the humane society for a time after his owner couldn't take care of him. He loves people.

All of them are fixed.

The house we expect to move into is really big and has a lot of space for the cats. We also plan to build a catio eventually. 

Her two cats have lived together for over a year. The bigger one literally threw up when my gf brought the other home. Mine has barely seen other cats in the 2 years since I got him.

Let me know what we should do! I know it'll take time to get them acclimated but I also know there are ways to make the transition easier.

I can’t afford my kitten anymore,"Hi everyone, I am really struggling and hoping for advice.

I got my kitten at 4 months old. Since the first day I had him, he had vomiting and diarrhea. I brought him to the vet within a week of getting him to keep him updated on shots and to help him get treatment for his GI issues.

We have been back every 1-3 weeks. We’ve done stool samples, blood samples… he has tested negative for genetic conditions, common parasites/worms/virus/bacteria. We have tried different foods. He has been on an antibiotic/anti inflammatory medications for almost 6 months. This was all probably $2k. 

During this time I did get pet insurance! 

After 5 months with our local vet, we finally went to an internal medicine specialist. My kitten got an ultra sound, and a lot more tests. He has colitis, low platelets, signs of decreased kidney function, and signs of a bacteria infection. These tests were $3k. 

The internal medicine specialist wants to put my cat under and get a colon biopsy. The estimate for this is $4k. 

Because I mentioned the diarrhea to the vet as soon as I got my kitten & he has received tests and treatment since then, insurance considers his GI issues a pre existing condition. 

I never thought all of these issues would last this long or be this severe. My kitten is so young, he is only 10 months old. I was always going to get him insurance, but I would’ve gotten insurance for him earlier if I had known he would have so many struggles. 

The bills are piling and I want nothing more than my cat to be healthy, but I can’t afford all of the bills.

Does anyone have any advice or recommendations? ",2024-03-25 02:33:34

The internal medicine specialist wants to put my cat under and get a colon biopsy. The estimate for this is $4k. 

Because I mentioned the diarrhea to the vet as soon as I got my kitten & he has received tests and treatment since then, insurance considers his GI issues a pre existing condition. 

I never thought all of these issues would last this long or be this severe. My kitten is so young, he is only 10 months old. I was always going to get him insurance, but I would’ve gotten insurance for him earlier if I had known he would have so many struggles. 

The bills are piling and I want nothing more than my cat to be healthy, but I can’t afford all of the bills.

Does anyone have any advice or recommendations? ",2024-03-25 02:33:34
I can’t afford my kitten anymore,"Hi everyone, I am really struggling and hoping for advice.

I got my kitten at 4 months old. Since the first day I had him, he had vomiting and diarrhea. I brought him to the vet within a week of getting him to keep him updated on shots and to help him get treatment for his GI issues.

We have been back every 1-3 weeks. We’ve done stool samples, blood samples… he has tested negative for genetic conditions, common parasites/worms/virus/bacteria. We have tried different foods. He has been on an antibiotic/anti inflammatory medications for almost 6 months. This was all probably $2k.

Moving two cats in together + trip short afterwards,"So my girlfriend and I are moving in together this summer, we both have one cat each and we want to make sure we introduce them well. Our lease starts June 25th, my gf will be moving in asap because her current lease ends on June 31st. I have until July 31st to move in because that is when my current lease ends however we both are going on a trip July 7th-13th. My question is would it be better to move my cat in the new apartment before or after the trip? They would be held in different rooms while we are away but I am unsure how the stress of moving plus me leaving for a week soon after would effect my cat. If I were to move in before the trip, we would have about a week to get them adjusted and possibly even introduce the cats but I am just unsure about the whole situation. Any advice could help, thanks!",2024-03-25 02:07:44

Cat keeps eating dog food and throwing it up. Any thoughts?,"I have a cat and a dog. The cat can get everywhere, the dog is limited to the bottom 50% of the house, lol (floors, sofa, bed). 

They’re both rescues, I got the dog first. He free feeds and his weight has always been steady. He also does most of his eating at night when I go to bed - who ever had him before me definitely fed the dogs at nighttime. 

The cat has some food issues. When I first got her, she was on a hunger strike and had lost a quarter of her body weight, poor baby. The issue has always been getting her to eat, so I was happy to notice that she’s getting a tiny bit chonky! Yay! I feed her 2x/day and I cut down the amount a little bit. 

So now, when she’s hungry, she eats the dog food. And then throws it up. Because it’s dog food and it’s not for her. And I come home from work to cat puke on the bed. 

What to do? I can’t move the food - everywhere the dog can get to, the cat obviously can get to. I can’t get the dog on a feeding schedule - he is NOT food motivated and just grazes at his kibble. He usually won’t even eat a piece of burger meat, and he spurns most treats. I would hate to keep him so hungry that he’ll actually eat all his food at once, especially since he’s an old man now and he’s used to eating while I’m asleep. 

Any thoughts? ",2024-03-25 02:06:40

Relocation with cat,"At the end of June I will be moving from NYC to Spain. I have a big cat, he is 8kg (he’s on a diet as per vet’s orders) but looks bigger. We will most likely be traveling with Iberia. I read that I can take him with me in the cabin if the combined weight of the cat + carrier is 8kg. 
I recently got a carrier that meets the airline’s requirements and it’s so small! He can’t stand. 
Anyone has recommendations of carriers? Or any other advice? I don’t want to send him in cargo. Thanks! ",2024-03-24 22:56:18

Please do not pad train your dogs and expect other people to watch them  ,"Title. We obviously pet sit for our husbands family when they need it since it’s reciprocal and all, but doing it for them is just so fucking annoying. 

They have a little teacup yorkie they decided to pad train. Works at their house fine I guess but also keep in mind they have NO rugs in their house. Not even a bathroom mat or kitchen mat. Always struck me as weird until we started pet sitting. 

Everytime we have to watch this damn dog there is absolutely nothing we can do to prevent her from pissing and shitting over our entire house  and on our rugs. We try and put her pee pads down and she misses them. And if she does use them our bigger dog will in turn get confused and  piss all over them too and absolutely drench the floor in piss. 

She will also piss on anything that is on the floor. Clothes, rugs, electronics, etc ANYTHING. Everytime we pet sit this dog we have to have to take every rug up (3 huge area rugs)  and get every single item off the floor. We forgot this time and ended up with a rug soaked in her and my dogs piss 

We usually just let her piss and shit wherever she wants and then clean it up as we go. We try and take her on walks but she literally will not pee or poop outside. 

They’re going on a week long trip this year and I think we’re just going to have to say no and deal with the consequences. A weekend of this shit is one thing but I would rather gouge my eyes out that do this for a week+

Used Vetster and LOVED it. ,"First, we have a regular vet in our community and they see our dogs regularly. We like them very much.

Now our community does have an emergency vet but their hours were just cut from being 24/7 to being 10 am to 4 pm three days per week and then closed one day and 24 hours one day. It’s not perfect. Also it costs a fortune. 

Our youngest dog has allergies that are driving him crazy and it’s the weekend, but we needed some help. I thought I would try Vetster, online vet care. 

I had an appointment in 10 minutes and the vet was amazing. He listened, had great ideas and even had suggestions for an issue that was not allergies related. He called in a prescription to our local pharmacy and the whole thing cost $65. 

For simple issues that cannot wait or if you are traveling or just cannot get an appointment with your regular vet, this is such an easy and quick solution. 

Obviously they cannot help with stitches or broken bones, but with hot spots or fireworks anxiety - such a fantastic use of technology!",2024-03-24 19:38:33

Stray Cat Showing her Babies to Me (T^T),"There's a white stray cat in our area. Rumor has it that **she wasn't originally a stray but was abandoned** by her previous owner (though I can't vouch for the credibility of this info). From the first day we fed her, she's made a habit of **coming to our home, banging against our door** when she's hungry. Occasionally, she kills a mouse and leaves it at our front door (which is gross ngl, as it's a mouse, not mice (# \`Д ‘) ). 

A few months ago, she became pregnant and started to stay near our home more often, sometimes even at our window. With her pregnancy, she's become extra clingy and constantly meows at me. Now, she's given birth. One time, when I called her over to feed her, she sat down in front of our door. I gave her food, but instead of eating it, s**he led me to one side of our home and showed me her kittens (இ﹏இ\`｡)** . She even allowed me to touch her tiny little babies (˚ ˃̣̣̥⌓˂̣̣̥ )づ♡. I'm not sure but based on a TikT\*k vids that I've watched; this behavior seems similar to the cat distribution system where she has **chosen me as her new owner. (,,>﹏<,,)**

However, the issue is that I'm unable to adopt her. I already have a dog, and our financial situation doesn't allow us to support more than one pet. I would love to take her in, but I'm hesitant because I'm unsure also if she might be carrying any diseases, whether on her fur or elsewhere. I've already experienced **the loss of my first dog due to parvo.** Parvo and distemper are **widespread in my area**, and many pet owners here have also lost their beloved dogs to these diseases. That's why I can't let her in or adopt her. If I had the funds, I would immediately take her to a vet for a thorough check-up so I could bring her home, but as a student, I can't afford to do that right now. So, for now, she and I are content with our interactions outside my home. 

So, I'm not sure if I'm asking a question or not, but that's the current situation between me and our local white stray cat. (♡ˊ͈ ꒳ ˋ͈)",2024-03-24 17:32:21

I'm not sure but based on a TikT\*k vids that I've watched; this behavior seems similar to the cat distribution system where she has **chosen me as her new owner. (,,>﹏<,,)**

However, the issue is that I'm unable to adopt her. I already have a dog, and our financial situation doesn't allow us to support more than one pet. I would love to take her in, but I'm hesitant because I'm unsure also if she might be carrying any diseases, whether on her fur or elsewhere. I've already experienced **the loss of my first dog due to parvo.** Parvo and distemper are **widespread in my area**, and many pet owners here have also lost their beloved dogs to these diseases. That's why I can't let her in or adopt her. If I had the funds, I would immediately take her to a vet for a thorough check-up so I could bring her home, but as a student, I can't afford to do that right now. So, for now, she and I are content with our interactions outside my home. 

So, I'm not sure if I'm asking a question or not, but that's the current situation between me and our local white stray cat. (♡ˊ͈ ꒳ ˋ͈)",2024-03-24 17:32:21
new puppy and cat HELP!,"Hi guys, we rescued 2 month old puppy but i have a tomcat who is not neutered and is 5 years old and he's kinda territorial. I've been trying to introduce them most gradually i can  (tomcat has been meowing in front of the doors and i can't let him in). i did scent exchange and (kinda?) meet up through balcony glass door (only the cat could see the puppy) and overall when i come from the room where puppy is to sniff my clothes. 

today was ""big"" day i had courage to let my cat see him and be in the same room as him. he was sleeping in my arms so safe from cat. 

anyway my cat reaction is kinda weird, he was angry first but i blinked at him and talked to him to stay calm (he was on table and i was on floor but not close to him). then he kinda didn't care about him and just sniffed everywhere that puppy has been in the room lmao? and then when he got kinda close he started ‼️foaming‼️ it never happened before and it only happened now when he saw new puppy. later it was mixed reaction my cat was sitting on a chair watching him and that's it literally kinda aggravated, i firstly pet the puppy then my cat but at some point i think he had enough so i just got him out of the room. My biggest concern here is the foaming part. any thoughts/knowledge about this

My newly adopted dog keeps submissively peeing on my bed and I don't know what to do,I just adopted a dog from my local shelter about a month ago. She's amazing and super sweet but she has a habit of hopping on the bed and when I try to get her off she rolls over on her side lifts her leg and pees A LOT not just little drops there's a puddle by the time she's done. I enjoy having her around and don't want to return her or get rid of her but I'm about to lose my mind. Iv slept on a bed of towels and carpet cleaner for about the past two weeks and it's really getting old. Iv been trying to break her from even getting up on the bed but tonight I left to go to the kitchen for not even a minute I come back she's in my spot I went to get a treat to try and coax her off but right when I acknowledged her she just started peeing. I'm currently laying on my last towel in the house and I'm at my wits end. Iv been trying not to raise my voice or scare her but I'm quickly losing my patience. What can I do to help this problem?,2024-03-24 14:39:46

Dog losing weight ,"Posting this here because I didn’t have any luck in the vet sub. Has anyone else experienced this and it didn’t have a good awful outcome??? I’m worried sick, in case people don’t read the full post I do have an appointment scheduled and his vet said it isn’t an emergency because he’s still eating and drinking :/ 

dog rapidly losing weight 

• Age: 8
• Sex/Neuter status: make, intact
• Breed: border collie
• Body weight: 30?pounds (he has always been on the smaller side)
• History: hit by car in Nov 2021, vet assured there was only injury to his leg, even though his entire backside was ran over (incident was witnessed by myself) he was casted and splinted twice a week for 16 weeks, was on daily gabapentin and nsaids
• Clinical signs: rapid weight loss, blood in stool x3
• Duration: 2 weeks (appointment is scheduled for 3 weeks out, vet has said it is not an emergency if he is still eating and drinking normally) 
• Your general location: Ohio
• Links to test results, vet reports, X-rays etc: n/a

I noticed a couple weeks ago my dog was looking smaller and eating like he was starving every meal time. I have checked his stool for worms and don’t see anything, and just started feeding him high protein food and supplementing with wet food to see if the issue gets any better, thinking maybe it could just be related to his age/clinical history considering that him getting run over greatly impacted his life. I am worried sick, and just looking/hoping for a little consolation before his appointment.

Rope toys can kill dogs,"First off: Dog had surgery and is okay. I'm sharing in case this might save another dog's life or at least save pain and suffering. 

We've always bought our dog rope toys and stuffies. He loved them. He'd tear them up and once in a while he'd swallow a piece but didn't seem like a big deal. 

Well, he suddenly got really sick. Throwing up, diarrhea, not good. So we called our vet. Our vet told us to take him to the emergency vet. 

The emergency vet did X-rays and ultrasound and said he had a mass in his stomach. They performed emergency surgery. 

The mass was all pieces of rope toys and stuffies. Like strands of hair in a drain - one strand doesn't block the drain but they build up and eventually the drain is blocked. It was like that. All the little pieces of stuffies and rope built up and blocked his stomach from emptying to the intestines. 

It cost us almost 4k. Without the surgery he would've died. 

So, I'm sharing in case this might save another dog's life or at least save pain and suffering. 

I know we're privileged that we were able to pay for the surgery and we are grateful for that privilege. We will not be allowing any stuffies or rope toys for our dogs ever again.",2024-03-24 09:41:30

Major dog rehoming problem,"Long story short. About seven years ago, I received a dog for my birthday, but due to his challenging behavior, after a year or so my dad and I decided to rehome him or return him. However, before we could do so, my sister and her husband swooped in and took the dog in to prevent him from what they assumed was going to the pound (I don’t recall if it was the pound or the original foundation we got him from). 

Fast forward to this last December, my sister needed me and my mom to watch this dog as she looked for a place to live. And promised my mom that she’d take the dog back in exactly one month. Well, a month goes by, and she decides to move back in with me and my mom. Despite initially promising to take the dog back after a month, she has now broke her promise and now refuses to contribute to his care or help find him a new home. And has now disowned the dog, claiming he was never hers. He’s my dog. So not her problem.

Now we are stuck with a dog no one wants. With arguments of “he’s not my dog”. And me and my mom are greatly struggling trying to rehome him as this isn’t fair for the dog himself for many reasons.

I genuinely don’t see how anyone would side with my sister. As I thought once you take the dog off the original owner’s hands…. You’re taking responsibility of the dog? You can’t just dump him back on me when things get rough and claim he never was your dog to begin with. I’m certain this dog would’ve been much happier had me and my dad got to return him like we were going to.

Any advice on how to navigate this situation would be appreciated. The dog is not being neglected in any way. But he needs a new home.",2024-03-24 08:40:29

Concerned about neighbor's pet(s),"A few months ago, I called my leasing office at the apartments I live at about a dog that's constantly whining and scratching at their front door; almost everyday. I can hear this quite well because their front door is just outside my window near where I have my desk. The leasing office then called them, and the neighbors came back shortly after. I have not heard the dog whining since. But... now, since then, I have heard a cat, constantly yowling. I always thought this was a stray cat up until recently since I've seen a lot of them around, but now I'm starting to believe it's the same neighbors again. The dog whining and cat yowling tends to happen when they're not home. Is there anything I can do outside of calling the leasing office? Or am I supposed to mind my own business?

Take dog or leave with family. Moving 8 hours away driving,"My last year of highschool I got my first dog and now that I’m done with college I’m likely going to be moving to a city for work. I’m really debating if I should take my dog with me or leave with my family. If I were to move I’d probably be 8 hours away driving so if I took my dog it would be hard to visit. I really want to take her, since she’s my baby and he’s gonna be 5 and I want to make the most of the time I have with her. She is pretty attached my dad, and we have a yard she loves. My big concern is that I’m likely going to be in an apartment for a year before I buy a house. For her to be happy I know she would need another dog and a yard and I’d feel bad taking her away from her house and my dad. She also is a pretty anxious dog so I’m not sure how she’d take living in a city or a new place.

While my parents are great at taking care of her, they are a little reckless and like to overfeed her so I’m worried that when I’m gone she’d gain weight or something bad could happen. Just a few weeks ago my mom cost me a few thousand since she gave her something extremely poisonous. My dad is incredibly stubborn and won’t listen when it comes to her health. While she was recovering he didn’t give her meds when I asked while I was at school. They also both work 8 hours a day everyday since they run a business, while I am going to be working I have a job that is fine with me working from home.  

I feel like short term she might not like coming with me since it would take a year or so before I can get her a friend and a big yard, but I’ll be able to take care of her better. 

TLDR should I take my dog or leave with parents",2024-03-24 08:19:15

I really want to take her, since she’s my baby and he’s gonna be 5 and I want to make the most of the time I have with her. She is pretty attached my dad, and we have a yard she loves. My big concern is that I’m likely going to be in an apartment for a year before I buy a house. For her to be happy I know she would need another dog and a yard and I’d feel bad taking her away from her house and my dad. She also is a pretty anxious dog so I’m not sure how she’d take living in a city or a new place.

While my parents are great at taking care of her, they are a little reckless and like to overfeed her so I’m worried that when I’m gone she’d gain weight or something bad could happen. Just a few weeks ago my mom cost me a few thousand since she gave her something extremely poisonous. My dad is incredibly stubborn and won’t listen when it comes to her health. While she was recovering he didn’t give her meds when I asked while I was at school. They also both work 8 hours a day everyday since they run a business, while I am going to be working I have a job that is fine with me working from home.  

I feel like short term she might not like coming with me since it would take a year or so before I can get her a friend and a big yard, but I’ll be able to take care of her better. 

TLDR should I take my dog or leave with parents",2024-03-24 08:19:15

Reasons I choose to keep hamsters over rats (at this particular time in my life) ,"For a while I couldn't decide between getting a pet hamster or rats. Almost everywhere I looked I was constantly seeing people reccomending rats over a hamster. If you're in a similar position of not being able to decide, here are some reasons why I chose to get a hamster over rats. One day I will eventually own rats but at this time in my life I can only keep one species.

1. Easier (for me at least) to find an enclosure. With hamsters you have different options for its home. Hamster specific made enclosures like niteangel, large plastic diy tubs, large aquariums, large terrariums and others. With rats you're more limited to enclosures like a PawHut.

2. I like keeping just the one hamster. 
I like focusing all my attention on just the one little fur ball. With rats you need at the very least 2 of them (which is double the waste to pick up) 

3. Hamsters care (for me) seems alot easier than caring for rats. I've done lots of research on both and for my particular lifestyle, I found that hamsters are a better fit for me. Although both animals require daily care, I think hamsters are more manageable (for me).

4. I've interacted with some very friendly hamsters. A common reason I noticed when people said that they liked rats over hamsters is that hamsters aren't affectionate whereas rats are. I've interacted with both and while I do agree that rats are more likely to be more friendly than a hamster, hamsters can still be pretty affectionate if you get that right one. My hamster is pretty docile and will just chill in my hands for a bit and take pets. Definitely not as cuddly as rat can be, but you still do receive affection. 

These are my reasons, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

HELP! Cats SPRAYING entire house! How do I clean it?,"HELP! House REEKS of cat pee! They won't stop SPRAYING! Help! My ENTIRE house REEKS of cat pee! I can't keep it clean and there are old, set in stains everywhere. I have 8 cats (ALL fixed)- 10 litter boxes. All cats have been vet checked and cleared. A couple of them started spraying when my son took his cat to college with him. (He was Alpha). Now the others have followed along and it's an all out pissing contest! They have peed/sprayed on countertops, every floor - carpet, hardwood, ceramic tile, on doors, furniture. Literally everything. And I can't keep up. I have used Feliway spray and diffusers (3600 sf house so that gets expensive), calming collars, prescription calming cat food (at $120/bag), prozac and now amitriptyline. I have cleaned with Nature's Miracle, Oxyclean, Angry Orange, My Pet Peed, and Rocco & Roxy. Their litter boxes get cleaned daily and are spaced on both levels of the house.

1. Any other suggestions on how to get them to stop spraying? It's clearly behavioral as I never had any issue until last year when 1 left.

2. .How can I get OLD urine smells out of hardwood floors, granite countertops, ceramic tile, walls, wood baseboards, and carpet?? (Basically the only thing they have missed at this point is the ceiling fans! 😩).

Replacing everything is not an option at this point. Our house is only 6 years old. We know we will have to replace a LOT if we ever want to sell. Until then, I just want to try to get them to stop (vet is out of ideas) and get the smell under control.",2024-03-24 05:50:11

Should I get a dog?,"I have always wanted a pet of my own, since childhood.
I wasn’t going to get one because of living in an apartment and not wanting to put pressure on my partner to look after it.
 My partner and I split up recently and I would love to have a pet companion now more than ever. 
I’m very good with cats and dogs and love them equally, and I know how to train dogs. The reason I would prefer a dog over a cat is because it forces me to get outside and take it for a walk, etc and I feel the bond is stronger than I have with cats, although I do still love cats.
I’m going to be starting fulltime work as a doctor next year and my concern with a dog is that it will have to stay in the apartment all day until I get home. I thought this would be a big no for getting a dog but a few people have recently said that as long as they get a walk in the morning and at night some breeds couldn’t care if they’re inside for the rest of the time. 
What do you guys think? I feel like a cat is definitely easier to look after and more happy to stay at home.
Thanks for your advice.",2024-03-24 04:43:16

i rehomed a stray cat i brought in and it’s breaking my heart.,"I had been feeding a stray cat for almost a year. We were getting a super cold wave for a week so i brought him inside. he’s been inside my house ever since, almost 4 month. When i brought him to the vet he was fixed and vetted and they said he was likely abandoned ): He was literally the sweetest boy ever. he did so amazing at the vet and being handled, he did so amazing letting me give him a bath. He was very shy and hid a lot. He and i got close, i spent a lot of time sitting with him just getting him to walk out from under the sink to me. He would always come out if i walked in, but not for anyone else who didn’t put time in with him. He would literally lift his head up and we’d sit forehead to forehead. he loved kisses. 

today after 4 months, i rehomed him. I feel this wave of guilt and sadness and anxiety. I have 3 other cats and keeping him just wasn’t realistic, their personalities didn’t really mesh. my other cats just kinda beat on him even though he was only ever excited to see them. he’d come out as soon as he saw another cat and would head but them just for them to be mean ): I gave him to someone i know from work. I didn’t want to give him to a stranger. When i dropped him off their apartment was smaller than i thought, vs my 4 bedroom house where he had a lot of space. she also has two kids where i have none. it’s just a different environment. I just feel like what if i made the wrong decision? what if he hates it? what if he’s anxious? what if he wants to be here? I thought i trusted her enough but then once i did it all these doubts started racing in my head. Is this how others feel once you get attached to a cat? ): i’m just so sad for him and so sad at the idea that he thinks he’s being abandoned again. UGH. any words from others who have rehomed or just words in general would be appreciated. ",2024-03-24 04:07:18

He would always come out if i walked in, but not for anyone else who didn’t put time in with him. He would literally lift his head up and we’d sit forehead to forehead. he loved kisses. 

today after 4 months, i rehomed him. I feel this wave of guilt and sadness and anxiety. I have 3 other cats and keeping him just wasn’t realistic, their personalities didn’t really mesh. my other cats just kinda beat on him even though he was only ever excited to see them. he’d come out as soon as he saw another cat and would head but them just for them to be mean ): I gave him to someone i know from work. I didn’t want to give him to a stranger. When i dropped him off their apartment was smaller than i thought, vs my 4 bedroom house where he had a lot of space. she also has two kids where i have none. it’s just a different environment. I just feel like what if i made the wrong decision? what if he hates it? what if he’s anxious? what if he wants to be here? I thought i trusted her enough but then once i did it all these doubts started racing in my head. Is this how others feel once you get attached to a cat? ): i’m just so sad for him and so sad at the idea that he thinks he’s being abandoned again. UGH. any words from others who have rehomed or just words in general would be appreciated. ",2024-03-24 04:07:18
"Pet insurance, what the heck is considered a pre existing condition?","Im... horribly confused. My 2 year old was born with congenital hip dysplasia that was found during her first veterinarian visit because I wanted  to ensure that the breeder was adhering to our contract. (suprise, she didnt). They found on the xray that she had mild subluxation of both hips. 

If she needs surgery in the future, I'm super confused as to how pet insurance expects me to justify that she ""had no symptoms"". Hip dysplasia isn't a symptom, nor is it a disease process. By definition, its a medical term. It's a deformity, as in, she was born that way. (most of the time, some can be aquired) The reason for the hip dysplasia is because her feet point out, including her entire hip. It is impossible for her to walk correctly (AKA, not a ""symptom) 

Osteoarthritis is a disease. Arthritis is a disease.

Can someone help me understand what's covered and what's not? And if there's policies that have coverage if any disease is, for a period of time, symptom free? ",2024-03-24 04:05:23

Help with rat respiratory infection ,"Hi, my rat has been having some respiratory infection issues lately and I am really concerned for her, and was wondering if anyone could give any advice.

fleas from cats at vet but no sign on their bodies,"i just went to get checkup for my 2 senior cats, they’re otherwise very healthy but noticed on the vet table several fleas showed up on the towel they sat on. of course i brought it up with the vet as he was examining and he confirmed they look like fleas. he did a flea comb on both cats and saw no signs. also no scratching or any symptoms.
i didn’t notice any fleas in my home, they sleep on my bed/pillow and i keep a very close eye on them EXCEPT yesterday, i changed their litter box and noticed a small bug crawling out of the emptied pan, similar looking to the ones from today.

the vet recommended advantage flea treatment, but i saw some posts about how it killed some peoples cats? i’m wondering if it is absolutely necessary or is there another possible explanation?
 
the cats lived with my parents until 2 weeks ago and my mom would let them outside in the day. since living with me they are strictly indoor except very occasionally going on the balcony (supervised). they’re adjusting well to living with me, but i’m perhaps overly concerned because my parents kind of neglected their needs as senior cats. also i just do not want fleas in my home.

any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! ",2024-03-24 03:14:42

Dog ate 6 months worth of flea meds. What to do,"ETA: Owners and poison control were called immediately and this is what PC instructed to do. Not everyone has an emergency vet nearby or the resources and I hope this can help at least one person. 
*Also dog puked and is perfectly fine now!

I found myself in the unfortunate situation. I hope this information helps someone else, although if your animal eats anything of concern always call poison control. 

I am supposed to dog sit for a week. My friend left town and texted me letting me know that the dog didn’t pee before they headed out. Awesome, I’ll head there now. Within the 30 minutes it took me to get there the dog ate a 6 MONTH PRESCRIPTION OF  CHEWABLE FLEA MEDS. 

TYPE OF MED: SIMPARICA TRIO

Here’s what to do: 

FIRST- Always call poison control as your vet will need a case number if/ when you bring them in. If the vet has to call it will be more expensive 

The dog had just eaten it so best solution is induce vomiting 

 - 1 1/2 tablespoons of NON EXPIRED hydrogen peroxide. Wait 10-15 minutes.

- if they don’t puke. Give 2 tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide. Do not exceed more than this. 

(Hydrogen peroxide expires approximately 6 months after opening)

If the dog doesn’t puke, or doesn’t puke up the pills, take them to an emergency vet. Excessive amounts of flea meds in a single dose can lead to neurological side effects such as seizures.

New Cat and Litterbox,"Hey everyone! I just adopted my first ever cat on Thursday evening. She ultimately seems to be adjusting well-eating and drinking, she walks around the apartment for small periods of time, plays with her little catnip mice on her own, and will play with the wand toy with me. She also had fun playing with her tail and often will rub up against me. She also slept next to me in the bed last night. 

She definitely doesn’t seem to like the TV, even when it’s muted so we’re working on that. 

With that said, it seems that every time she wanders out of the bedroom (where she seems to feel safest) she always ends up making her way to the litter box. She seems to be peeing about twice a day (golf ball sized clumps) and pooping about once a day. 

Since it seems like she is okay health-wise; are her frequent visits to the litter box normal given that she still adjusting, is it she maybe unhappy or stressed with something?

Thanks for your advice! We have our first vet appointment scheduled in two weeks.",2024-03-24 01:28:39

Rehoming My 1yr old cat ,"Hey guys! 

So I’m moving to another country in a couple of months and I’m thinking of rehoming my cat as plan A and plan B is to take him with me. Someone found him on the street and I took him in when he was 2 months. 

I’m trying to avoid plan B because even in this new country
1. The journey is more than 22 hrs long and my cat will be in cargo throughout 
2. I don’t know how long I will be staying in the new country and might have to move again
3. This process is very expensive. If I’m able to do it this time I won’t be able to afford it again, given I have to move around once again.

I’m leaving in July and I have found a really nice couple who rescued a 12yr old cat and have had her for 3 years. They are very keen on having him!

My plan is to have my cat stay with them every other month for a couple of days or a week to introduce him to the new environment (given there is another cat) until July. I don’t want him to have any abandonment issues. 

Is there anything more I can do to make the rehoming process easier and less stressful for him?

Pyothorax: The best girl is in deep trouble,"I'm at a loss. Our 11 year old English Cocker is in the hospital right now with Pyothorax.  She had been on antibiotics for tracheitis, but her breathing started getting really labored. We  took her to the emergency vet. We just got the call with the pathology results. It's 3 AM, and I don't see myself getting back to sleep for a while.

Doing some reading it seems like the outcome can vary wildly, but when I run into forum posts, they never seem good. It seems like a nightmare for having any idea what to expect.  She's got a CT scan scheduled tomorrow. I'm hoping that they tell us that the underlying cause is fixable, but as I mentioned, nobody seems to have a good story to tell. When it comes to treatment, I don't know how far is too far. I want the best for her! Maybe it's still too early to tell.  Maybe the posts are from people who had to make a different choice for financial reasons.

Does anybody have any advice? Maybe a little  insight? Hopefully an encouraging story? 

I know we don't have forever with her, but I want the few more years she deserves!",2024-03-23 16:16:28

Trying to Find Dog That Was Rehomed Without Permission,"Hello, all. I don't know how much attention this will get, but I need some help.

My partner went through a separation in 2020, and because of this his dog was rehomed by his ex without permission while he was still getting a new place to stay. Because of his depression and state of mind at that time, he didn't have the energy to fight and find his dog. To this day, he still misses his dog. Its one of his biggest regrets.

&#x200B;

I want to attempt to locate the dog and try and reunite them. I know he was given away on Facebook in 2020 around June. I was thinking of posting in as many groups as I can in that city in hopes of finding something. He doesn't talk to the ex but he can, but he doesn't want to (understandably).

Realistically, what's my luck? Is this a lost cause? Anyone had any success? Advice? I still want to try even if it is.

One of her dog is a male dog who is 6 months older than mine and also comparatively a larger breed. Since both of my parents are seniors already they couldn’t take care of all the dogs 24/7. Hence one morning they woke up to discover my sister’s male dog and my dog linked together. In short, nakasta yung puppy ko. The thing is my puppy might be pregnant by now and I dont have the budget to support and raise puppies at the moment.

I feel so bad for my dog and havebeen crying for hours now because idk what to do.",2024-03-23 15:12:12
How can people have a goldfish?,"Sooo you get a fish and out it in a bowl…then call it a pet? NO LOL! All you did was confine a fish to a small body of water. You seriously don’t get what a “pet” should be. 🤣

please help my dog!,"hi there! i'm a first time dog owner and my teddy-bear is three years old.

recently, he's been searching for a certain toy and he can't seem to find which one he wants.

i left out of town for two days and left him with my grandparents so he wouldn't be alone. when I came back home, he had been favoring a toy we had gotten him when he was just a puppy. nothing too fancy, your average squeaker toy.

he's been carrying it around in his mouth, sleeping next to it, making sure nobody takes it, and even crying when it's out of reach. he doesn't seem to want to play with it either.

it makes me feel upset not knowing what he wants, or why he's suddenly so attached to an old toy he recently dug up a few weeks ago.

again, i'm a first time dog owner, and all this is very new to me. if you've had any similar experiences with your pet, please share them or any other things that may help me get a better understanding under this thread. thank you!!

How to know when it’s time to put dog down,"I have a 14 year old lab mix who has a large nasal tumor. It has significantly grown since December and takes up a large portion the right side of her face. She does not have any air flow in her right nostril.

She’s been on prednisone since September for the tumor and I give her cbd oil at night. I know her time is coming but I just don’t know when to make the call. ",2024-03-23 11:05:24

Majority of the pets I meet are scared of me,"Pretty much every single time I meet someone's pet, or even in the street sometimes, the animal is scared of me. It happened multiple times that the owner told me that they never reacted this way and that it's odd that they are that scared. Often times after I gain their trust they love me and are quite clingy even but it takes a few hours and work.

My ex's dog would see me often and each time they would be so scared they'd pee themselves. The dogs usually ""warning"" bark at me and growl.

I am a very calm person, I never go to dogs or animals to pet them, I always wait for them to come to me. I don't talk loudly at all and am not very energetic. I don't understand why it happens so much as I really do love animals and have no way of explaining this as it have been happening for years.",2024-03-23 10:26:45

PLEASE HELP. My dog won’t let anyone cut his nails/touch his paws ,"So I have a 8 year old Shihpoo and he’s never minded being groomed. The groomers would always say how he did such a good job but over the past few years I would groom him at home and also take him to the groomers but it’s been a while since he’s been to the groomers so he hasn’t had his nails cut and he also gives me a hard time shaving down his paws. I bought dog nail clippers and he hates them so I bought an electric nail filler and he definitely hates that because of the sound. He’ll snatch away or try to run into a corner and it’s frustrating because they’re so long. 

Today I took him to get updated vaccines so he could go back to the groomers and I told the vet that he doesn’t like his nails cut or his paws really touched but she gives it a go anyway with my consent. I let them try because I figure they have a better way of doing it since they’re in the profession but he still gave them a hard time :/ 

They gave me anti anxiety meds for him to give the day before and day of the grooming. I’m realllllly hoping that it works. Does anyone else have a pet that’s like this? What did you do to? Please help me, he’s such a good dog but his behavior and cooperation has changed over the years (which is understandable with age) but that doesn’t get him off the hook from getting his nails cut lol. It’s unsafe for him and I just want him to be healthy and happy. ",2024-03-23 08:11:24

Cat relationships..,"☆Basically im asking if this baby daddy will be too heart broken if we take him to a shelter and no longer be such a loving and trusting cat, or if it would even make a difference once he is neutered. Also if little mama even seems like she likes him.. 




So, a year ago we moved to this area and we homed a cat. Of course same old, same old, she was in-preg-greg man.. had 3 bbz. They are old enough she swats at them to tell them to start their own families. 

Well now the good old bby daddy is in the picture and on one hand... she kinda doesnt like him. Like she tolerates him, but if he gets any closer than her bubble, he will get messed up. 

On the secondhand... he has never hit her back, he is always following her on her tail.. even entered our house twice now when she ate... i cant move him(ill explain later) i also have a dog who is basically a cat and at first he would puff up but then look at her and see she was chill and still grooming and would instantly calm down even with my boi like inches away. So he trusts her with his life, is what that says to me(other dogs around here bark horribly at the cats when they see them)

And now we are about to move.. like in the next 2 weeks. Cats last to go so the smells are in the house and they will hopefully be more comfortable. But he isnt mine, he has a bad eye infection which i do have the medication for but i dont see him everyday let alone enough to do it 2 times a day. It hasnt gotten worse, but it hasnt gotten better.. he has a big wound behind his ear (not a gash so thats good.) Which he will let us lightly touch but if we have ANYTHING in our hands, he is gone... still not neutered. 

Ive thought about bringing him into a no kill shelter because he does have good chances to be a great cat for someone. The first time i meet him, he was about to mess up another cat out front and so i didnt know what to do and he let me pick him up and move him. No issues at all. He is very sweet. But if i do that i dodnt want his heart to break away from our little mama.. 

Ive thought about taking him with but we already have 4 cats, one dog, a 1.5 year old, and a 5 month old... like i cant bro.. plus he seems to just pester little mama. Would he even care anymore after being neutered? Or what? I cant just like leave little mama but also my old man and i have talked and if she comes back here (was obviously born here i see her dang dad around all the time.. carbon copy) we wont try to move her again and leave it be maybe checking in every once and a while. 
But if i just leave her here for him i feel like that is just all wrong because will die eventually with this infection if it doesn't get fixed.... idk man.. plus im unsure if she even loves him back like that.. he seems kinda r@p¥ to me but i have watched them very intentionally for a very long time and he hasnt tried anything. She wont let him get close enough.. sometimes at night she goes off on a bitch fit to him. I think she is sick of him to be honest. But i dont wanna break his soul..

change in cat’s personality ,"desperate for advice! i love cats and grew up around them. my family’s last cat was very affectionate so that was what i’m used to and was looking for. i just adopted a cat who, went i met him at the cat cafe, immediately snuggled into my lap. when i brought him home, the first 6 weeks were similar - he was velcro-ed to me, always in my lap or snuggled near me. 

then abruptly, his personality shifted. he became tense, a little hostile and way less affectionate. he literally avoids my lap, jumping over or around me. he also just seems less happy. 3 days ago, i brought him to the vet and found out he had an ear infection, but he’s been on medicine since and nothing has seemed to change. the only other change that lines up with the timeline is i bought an automatic feeder. 

i’m really sad. i feel like a horrible pet owner that something i’m doing is making this cat unhappy and i’m also selfishly mourning the loss of what i thought would be an affectionate pet. i have dozens of photos of him curled up in my lap and it’s weird to think that’s the same cat.

i’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and if they have advice! greatly appreciated.  ",2024-03-23 08:08:45

Store Cats Future in Question,"Half rant, half wondering what I should do. Wasn’t sure exactly where to post this but here goes. 

Cashier here. I work at a hardware store where we have two cats, both having lived at the store for about 2 years now, ever since they were kittens. Dusty- a playful gray tabby with a huge personality, and Schmutz- a white and ginger that just wants to be pampered. They’re both super personable and comfortable, having been raised at the store their whole lives. But now there is another employee who just told me that she pretty much plans on stealing them. 

Some backstory is required, so please bear with me. One of our managers, I’ll call her Rita, just lost her job here a little less than a week ago. She wasn’t a good fit at the store for a lot of reasons, but that’s not important. But with her leaving, she has caused massive amounts of drama and rumors with the staff, turning people against each other and convincing others that they are going to be next to go. It’s all BS, but some of our employees are more gullible than others, so she managed to leave things a little shaky. She is relevant because she is the reason that we have the cats. Schmutz was a kitten from the litter of her friend’s cat. Rita adopted her for the store to keep mice away from the bird seed that we sell. Dusty was found behind the store as a stray about a month later and was taken in. They were both around the same age. 

One person that Rita has sunk her claws into is another cashier that I will call Morgan. Rita has this woman convinced that she is going to be fired soon. She came in to work the other day crying, and despite being told by the general manager that he has no intentions of firing her, she refuses to believe it in favor of what vindictive Rita has told her. 

The store is closed only a few days of the year for some holidays. When we are closed, Morgan will usually take the cats to spend the night at her apartment so that they get fed and taken care of. Now that Easter is coming up, she is going to take them home again soon. Though today she told me that she isn’t going to bring them back after Easter. It doesn’t seem like she’s told anyone else, and our general manager was not at the store today. 

Turns out that she had a talk with Rita. Rita says that she wants Morgan to take the cats with her if she ever gets fired, because she claims that they are her cats (despite leaving them here), and that she only trusts Morgan with them. And since Morgan is convinced that she’s not going to last much longer at the store, I guess she just plans on taking them preemptively while she has the chance. 

I’m pretty worried about this, because I absolutely love these cats. I’m a lot younger than everyone else that works here (I’m 21, the rest of the staff is about 50+), so the the cats are pretty much my closest buddies at the store. It’s also their home, and they are clearly very content here. Not once have they ever tried to leave the store despite the doors being constantly opened and closed. 

I’ll get to see the general manager again on the Monday before Easter and I plan on letting him know what’s going on. I’m just hoping that something gets done about it in time, because he can be pretty non-confrontational. Anyone have any advice on how I should handle this? I love my girls and don’t want to see their home get reduced from an entire store to explore and tons of attention from the whole neighborhood, down to a small apartment with just one woman living there.

TLDR: Store cats that have spent their entire lives here may be sneakily rehomed by salty staff, and I’m pissed about it.

I’m a lot younger than everyone else that works here (I’m 21, the rest of the staff is about 50+), so the the cats are pretty much my closest buddies at the store. It’s also their home, and they are clearly very content here. Not once have they ever tried to leave the store despite the doors being constantly opened and closed. 

I’ll get to see the general manager again on the Monday before Easter and I plan on letting him know what’s going on. I’m just hoping that something gets done about it in time, because he can be pretty non-confrontational. Anyone have any advice on how I should handle this? I love my girls and don’t want to see their home get reduced from an entire store to explore and tons of attention from the whole neighborhood, down to a small apartment with just one woman living there.

TLDR: Store cats that have spent their entire lives here may be sneakily rehomed by salty staff, and I’m pissed about it.

Treating Hepatic Lipidosis at home w/ cat,"Hello all!
My cat had surgery on 03/14. She was hospitalized from 03/14-03/17. Anemia, High Liver Enzymes, and post op for the enterotomy (they removed a foreign object.) She was on an NG tube for 3 days and began to nibble a bit at food in the hospital so they didn’t send her home with a feeding tube. I personally believe they should have as within days of returning home she lost her appetite.
I corresponded with the vet and we decided on syringe feeding urgent care a/d diet food everyday 160 ml. I started slow. 30 ml 2 days ago, 60 ml yesterday, and we were going to go up to 120 today but the vet and I spoke as she’s developed jaundice and decided to go up to 160 ml daily from here on out. 
Recheck bloodwork was done 03/19 that showed her liver numbers were up again. She’s currently on Denamarin as well for her liver started on 03/20. I cannot afford to hospitalize her again. What they’d do for her there is aggressive nutritional support, iv fluids, and medications as well. I spent $9000 on emergency care in the last week and I am just simply out of funds.
Any tips on how I can continue to manage this at home? Has anyone else ever had to manage this at home?
Any tips or advice is appreciated!!!
*** Update! 
Opted for the E tube as I finally found a veterinarian willing to put it in (the emergency clinic who knows her case VERY well) for an ‘affordable’ cost! (: ",2024-03-23 03:27:16

cat urinates in room-Help please!,"I need advice. My 4 yr old cat began urinating in my bedroom in August.. at least that what I think. At the time I had covid & this time around completely lost my sense of smell 😫 I found d the urine on a plastic bag behind my bedroom door. We adopted a new kitten that same summer in June. They are both fixed. Not sure if it’s territorial or if my cat is possibly ill. I cleaned everything & bought a shampooer. They have two litter boxes. I clean regularly. I’ve seen him use for sure. Thought we were in the clear until a few days ago when he peed in my room again. I’m wondering if he’s been doing it all along? He recently also peed in my daughter’s room which is so odd. I took a lot of pride in my clean house & now I’m so if it smells bad regularly since I don’t think my sense of smell came back 100%.  

In order for me to take him to vet they recommend he be medicated. He’s a big 17 lb cat. & isn’t friendly at the Dr. How can I give him the meds successfully? When he sees the syringe he runs all over the house. I’m tired. I don’t let my cats outside but I’m seriously considering it. But then fleas, predators etc. I kind of regret getting two cats but I know this is a long term commitment. ",2024-03-23 00:14:03

Fleas,"Unfortunately my dog has been scratching a lot and this morning I found a flea on my bed. I’ve been going through Reddit and google trying to find solutions.

3. Sprinkle baking soda on furniture and then vacuum 
4. Spray diluted vinegar on furniture 

Is it true that I will need to wash and vacuum daily? I don’t think that is feasible for me to do. Is doing these steps once effective enough? Will vinegar and baking soda kill eggs? Please help 😭😭😭

cat flaps,"My previous cats all had the ""luxury"" of me being their personal doorman, but with my new cats, i've decided that maybe a catdoor isn't a bad idea.

and... then you go look for, and find a million different ones, one with worse reviews than the other...

does anyone have any idea of a GOOD petdoor for a decent price, which can fit average/large  cats (so far they are still just average, but they might still grow a bit and i also just want them to be able to pass comfortably through instead of acrobatically)

though in theory they can get through 8cm holes (i've seen them do it), a bit more space would be nice.  
some decent draught-protection would also be great.

i'm not really interested in the microchip ones as that just risks something not working and i really don't want them to get locked out.

this one, at first glance, seems to be interesting, but i find it strange that their website seems to not be updated and everything is out of stock, with no reviews on youtube.  
i also find it strange that the idea doesn't seem to have been imitated, as it does seem to make sense that this is the best kind of petdoor: [https://www.thepetflap.com/](https://www.thepetflap.com/)

so, does anyone have any experience with decent catflap/doors, that are easy enough for the cats to use, and decent enough to keep out most of the draught ?

What was your biggest mess-up with your pet you still feel bad about?,"Granted i was 10/11 when this happened so i guess the mess-up was more on my parents because i really couldn’t have done shit but anyways here’s my story:

when i was maybe 10 we went on a trip and left our doggies with a very trusted doggie daycare we knew personally. they stayed with her multiple times before and after this, so this incident was really just wrong place wrong time.

anyways my dad picks them up and they are 100% fine. all is fine and dandy for a few days until we notice one dog is a bit stinky. the thing was, she smelled RANK (i’m not kidding it was one of the worst things i’ve ever smelled) but other than the stank, she was completely normal. no sign of any pain.

so maybe a day and a half goes by and my dad decided to give her a bath, to get her stink out. he takes off her collars, and what he described will stay with me for life.

i never saw it, but he described it as “an infected, green stinky glob of pus” on her neck. we’re guessing she got it from playing with another dog at the daycare. it was so bad we had to throw away one of her collars. he got it cleaned up before i saw her and after a few days of anti-biotics, she was healed.

i feel pretty terrible for that one. the thing is, nothing was out of the ordinary. she never felt any pain, didn’t even itch her neck or anything. still a big mess up.

what about you?",2024-03-22 12:41:04

"My cat has been sneezing a lot, but seems okay? Is it vet time?","Hi there! We just finished a 4 hour move to a big city in our state on the 16th. On the 18th my 2 year old cat started sneezing a lot. We figured it is just because of the stressful move, as this also happened when we took her home from the shelter. Only thing new in our place is a rug and ceiling fans. We have had a couple stressful days ourselves so I imagine its worse for her.

"My cat has been sneezing a lot, but seems okay? Is it vet time?","Hi there! We just finished a 4 hour move to a big city in our state on the 16th. On the 18th my 2 year old cat started sneezing a lot. We figured it is just because of the stressful move, as this also happened when we took her home from the shelter. Only thing new in our place is a rug and ceiling fans. We have had a couple stressful days ourselves so I imagine its worse for her.

How to (as a human) get through pet surgery when you have anxiety?,"I have really bad anxiety and my dog is getting surgery tomorrow morning (lateral suture for CCL tear. She fit the requirements and is a generally calm dog so we agreed it was the best decision).

Im trying to help myself by preparing her for in surgery and during recovery. She has an area set up for recovery in our room, she got a bath and nails clipped today, I got her a lick mat, etc.

Old dog,"Another post here started me thinking about one of my old dogs.  He was a shih tzu, loved people, he wished he didn’t have legs so people would carry him everywhere.  

When he was 18 he went deaf, and began sleeping in his bed in the master bathroom, away from me and the other dogs, just by himself.  One day I heard him shriek from the other end of the house.  As I ran back there, I heard a commotion, a man and a woman chattering.  When I got to the bathroom I saw my dog having a doggie dream, paddling his legs a bit, but no screaming, like what I heard.  Then the voices, I realized they were talking about the dog!  The man’s voice was like a radio not quite tuned to a station, fading in and out.  The woman’s voice was what you might hear on one of the haunting programs, no kidding.  One word was loud the next quiet, quick then slow, some drawn out.  This is what she said: “The dog, is he okay!”  So I said to the air, “He’s just having a dream, he’s fine.”  The man voice seemed to be trying to shush the woman voice, then they faded away.  There is absolutely no way I heard my dog scream, too far.  Plus I’ve never heard him scream.

I heard them on maybe ten other occasions, all but one other I couldn’t make out.  Just people talking.  What was I gonna do about it, I don’t know.  A few months later it was time, I had him euthanized.  I’ve never heard the voices again.  I hope they all run and play together, wherever they are. ❤️",2024-03-22 07:34:23

Pet medical record - missed information?,"My cat went to the doctor for constipation, and I mentioned that he’s had constipation before, but didn’t really tell them why. I was sorting through my notes and realized that the reasons for these constipation episodes were different (dude swallowed something the first time around, the most recent one was just because of stress). And in the midst of pure panic, I made the incredibly dumb decision to call my vet and see if they can add that detail in the notes because I had missed it. Obviously they can’t do it, and told me that because that may be insurance fraud - I didn’t even think of that!

I do have insurance and I was planning to claim the visit and all I thought at that time was that I need to be as thorough as possible with the details. Looking back, that was a very dumb call.

Cat being aggressive for treats.,"So he has normally been very mild mannered I guess. I feed him regularly at the normal times and he has this routine where he likes to flop on the rug and I rub his backside and belly while he claws it and rolls around, its a cheap one so I don't mind as he doesn't scratch anything else he isn't suppose to. However I did start giving him these Delectables squeeze treats every now and then. His motor goes on full throttle when he sees I have one, eager to jump up with me and climb on me for one.  


The issue is I decided I'd be nice, gave him some 2 days in a row a week ago. Now he seems very irritated if I don't give him one. At least that is the vibe I get, I can pet him but he is quick to grab my arm (no claws), lick my arm or hand then he ""bites"" with light force 2 or 3 times then licks and stops. If I try to pet him more or pull away then he uses claws to hold my arm there and rabbit kicks. It does leave scratches and has drawn a bit of blood but nothing painful. If I give him one, then he settles down like he used to and is very chill the rest of the day.   


Just very odd behavior to me. I assumed the biting/clawing was him being bored as he is an only cat, do try to play with him but he loses interest quick in everything I bought him, short of a laser pointer but even then he still gets bored a few minutes into it. Any idea perhaps?",2024-03-22 01:44:58

People touching my dog without consent while walking in NYC,"Hi all,

  
I wanted some advice, or at least a place to vent. I have an incredibly anxious 3-year-old dog in NYC who does not like to be touched when she is outside or by strangers. I took her in from a friend who had to leave the country and did not socialise her well at all. She also previously lived in the suburbs and now lives in Manhattan, so she's still dealing with the adjustment period over 6 months later.  
She is incredibly cute and I take a lot of care of her, but she seems to attract a NUMBER of wandering hands who want to pet her. I have a ""do not pet"" sign on her leash but I will run into a handful of people trying to touch her. It's very frustrating because her body language clearly indicates she doesn't want this. She'll often back into me, jump, try to run away, and (earlier on while dealing with the initial culture shock) would step on my legs and pee on me. People STILL ask me if they can pet her even though I watch them read her ""do not pet"" sign like they are some kind of exception; I've even had people still try to touch her after I tell them no.

  
I'm just frustrated because people seem to be entitled and assume dogs are public property or get upset with ME when I tell them she is anxious and doesn't like to me touched. This really disrupts her routine outside as well. Last night, it took her nearly an hour to poo because she tried on 4 different occasions and each time, someone just touched her and it freaked her out.

  
I'm also coming to terms with people taking pictures of her (and me) without our consent. It's annoying but I know I can't do anything about it, but it's particularly annoying when she's clearly not doing well (tail between legs, shaking) and people blatantly pull out their phones and stick in her face.  
She's worked with a trainer before outside of NYC for her walking and anxiety. She's on some anti-anxiety medications that have been prescribed from a vet. I am saving up to get her to work with a behavioural therapist/trainer. I'm trying to find a dog that she can have play dates with and become more confident. I try walk her super early and late at night to avoid the biggest crowds of people but obviously there's times mid-day that I need to take her out.

  
I just want to know if there's anymore I can do. I do also have a vest that I sometimes put her in but I found the sign on her leash to be more impactful. I feel very lucky to have such a beautiful and loved girl, I just wish people could love from afar without feeling entitled enough that they need to put her or touch her without her consent. We don't touch people or children without consent, I don't understand why it's so hard for people to do the same with pets.",2024-03-21 23:47:17
"Is this animal abuse, or just and old dog?","I just finished school for today literally 25 minutes ago. I live within walking distance of the school, and so does my friend, so we always walk home (as do many others). On our way home we saw a bunch of our classmates surrounding what looked to be a yellow Labrador. We didn't think much until we got closer...

The labradors waist could not have been much thicker than 15 cm. It was also limping and had weird spots in its face, one of the spots had blood on it. 
As you can imagine the dog did NOT look healthy at all. We all thought the dog had ran away from home and had been lost for a couple of days. This included my friend who I was walking with, who is a huge dog guy. He loves dogs.

We quickly look for a number on the name tag to see if we could call anyone. The first number didn't work but the second one did. We call and it's the house next to us...
A middle aged woman comes out and says she apologises for the scare as she admits it doesn't look healthy. Her justification is that the dog is 18 years of age. That is as most of you would know, pretty old. She took the dog inside and we went home.

Another thing is that I've lived here since I was 2 years old and have NEVER seen this dog. I have walked past that house a million times, and never seen the dog. I am very concerned, as I do not know if the dog is just old or if this is a real case of them not feeding the poor pup.

How to deal with a pet you know is being mistreated....,"Hi all. I'm sure stories similar to this one have been told a million times before, but I'm quite worried for this animal and I wanted to see if there was maybe something I could do (though I'm prepared for the possibility that there isn't). 

My boyfriend and I are college students and I hang out at his apartment pretty often. We consistently spend time with a cat that is owned by one of his neighbors. The cat is INCREDIBLY friendly, like maybe the friendliest animal I've ever met. We've spent enough time with him (his name is Puma) that he immediately comes to us as soon as he hears my voice, and will follow us around. He's even tried to follow us into the apartment before but we couldn't let him in, because he's not ours. 

We don't see Puma every day, maybe only once or twice a week. However, when we do see him, he's outside in the parking lot, always really late at night maybe 10 or 11 pm. His owner is nowhere to be found, and I have no reason to believe she lets him in later at night, or at all. We've seen him as late as midnight, maybe past, and he's always outside. Usually we let him into the apartment complex and leave the door propped open if he wants to go outside. I know some people have ""outdoor cats"", but I don't believe it's common practice to just leave your cat outside all night. He has no collar, and I'm not sure if he's chipped or not. He is neutered, as far as I know. 

The owner is very nice, we've never had a problem with her. However, she seems a little...unwell. This is no judgement at all, as I'm very familiar with mental illness and I do sympathize with her, but I just don't think she has the capacity to take care of Puma. 

Today we saw him outside and he was limping when he ran towards me. We took a closer look at his leg, and it was almost certainly broken. There was a very clear deformation. We had no idea how long he'd been like that, as we didn't see him the night before. We decided to knock on the owner's door (to which she took a very long time to respond), and she only opened the door when we mentioned that we thought Puma's leg was broken. She thanked us for letting her know and took him inside, saying he has ""arthritis"". I'm not a vet, but I don't think arthritis looks like that. 

To be fair, she did freak out once we mentioned Puma, and she seemed very concerned, and she was super grateful that we had her intention. I don't think she's a bad person at all, she's actually always been nice in our few interactions (I don't see her as often as my boyfriend does because she's usually only there in the mornings when I'm not). However, it's pretty clear that she's not taking the best care of Puma. 

Now honestly, I'm pretty positive there's not much I can do. It would be different if she was extremely neglectful and didn't care about the cat, but she seems pretty possessive over him. I'm also allergic to cats, and my boyfriend may not have the capacity to take him in. But Puma is genuinely the sweetest animal I've ever met. He's never showed a single sign of aggression to us ever. It hurts my heart to have to leave him every night not knowing if he's sleeping outside or safe or who knows. 

If anyone has any advice, I'd love to hear it, even if its just ways to support Puma from afar. I've brought up getting him some snacks, toys, and maybe a bed/cushion to put in the apartment lobby, Also, I'm not sure if she's going to take him to the vet or not, so what should we do if she doesn't? I don't want his leg to never heal properly because of this neglect. Anything helps! 

TL;DR - neighbor owns a cat that is incredibly sweet, and while neighbor is nice it's pretty clear she is unwell and doesnt have the capacity to take care of the cat. we found the cat with a (probably) broken leg, and now we're even more worried. what to do? ",2024-03-21 14:57:33
Any advice to let my cat see out the window without killing my privacy?,"So my cat loves to look out the windows, and he does it frequently. The only problem with that is that I don't like the idea that my windows are always uncovered, especially while I'm at school or sleeping. 
I currently have the blinds that you pull a cord to move them up and down, and I have to raise those in order for him to sit in the window (Same with opening the curtains because he will try anyway if they're closed and it's fallen a few times).

I left him behind so I could get everything settled here and then planned on bringing him but the more I think about it the worse I feel. I don’t want to take him out of what he knows. His comfort zone. It also worries me because even though both cats don’t love each other, he always has her there when no one’s home. He’s a very shy and nervous cat and the plane ride (it isn’t too long) but worries me that I might put him under stress. He’s scared of every single noise and person he sees besides my family or someone who’s around a lot. I also moved into a not so big apartment compared to my house back home it’s not much room. It worries me that I might make him sick or depressed, he seems to be bonding with my sister now, naps with her and etc. I just can’t seem to shake the feeling of him thinking I abandoned him or something like that.

Devastated after rehoming my cats please help....,"
I had adopted two tuxedo boys when they were around 5 weeks old. I have had them for a year and a half. When I got them they came from a hoarding situation. I nursed them back to health for the first 8 months of their life I cooked their food twice a day and tried my absolute best to give them a fantastic life. They grew to be happy and healthy boys. 
 I live in a 2 bedroom condo and always wished they had more room. But they seemed comfortable. They love watching birds and my condo association recently made a new policy; no more feeding the birds. I was going to build them a catio on my porch and was also told no. 
     I have serious health issues. I had a rare intestinal transplant and recently had a cancer scare and had to have surgery. Prior I was very anxious and as a result one of my boys pulled a lot of his fur out and the other ended up on anxiety meds because he was a mess. The vet said both were anxiety related and ask me what was happening in my life. It was my anxiety affecting them!!
I recently rehomed them because I'm worried my own health will leave me in a position where I'm unable to care for them, and my anxiety causing them distress. I often have to spend lots of time in the hospital and home recovering in bed for long periods as well. I felt like I wasn't giving them the life that they deserved. And like I said no more bird watching and no more being on my porch due to new rules. ( moving is not an option) 
 I found an amazing couple that's 15 min from me. They are wonderful but I am absolutely gutted. I can't stop crying. I feel like the absolute worst person in the world. 
The couple that has them tells me they are still very skittish Theo is being more friendly but Finn, the one that was most attached to me is not eating well and only comes out at night. 
     Has anyone, ANYONE had to rehome their pets for circumstances they have little control over and HOW have you coped ??? All I do is cry.

Devastated after rehoming my cats please help....,"
I had adopted two tuxedo boys when they were around 5 weeks old. I have had them for a year and a half. When I got them they came from a hoarding situation. I nursed them back to health for the first 8 months of their life I cooked their food twice a day and tried my absolute best to give them a fantastic life. They grew to be happy and healthy boys. 
 I live in a 2 bedroom condo and always wished they had more room. But they seemed comfortable. They love watching birds and my condo association recently made a new policy; no more feeding the birds. I was going to build them a catio on my porch and was also told no. 
     I have serious health issues. I had a rare intestinal transplant and recently had a cancer scare and had to have surgery. Prior I was very anxious and as a result one of my boys pulled a lot of his fur out and the other ended up on anxiety meds because he was a mess. The vet said both were anxiety related and ask me what was happening in my life. It was my anxiety affecting them!!
I recently rehomed them because I'm worried my own health will leave me in a position where I'm unable to care for them, and my anxiety causing them distress. I often have to spend lots of time in the hospital and home recovering in bed for long periods as well. I felt like I wasn't giving them the life that they deserved. And like I said no more bird watching and no more being on my porch due to new rules. ( moving is not an option) 
 I found an amazing couple that's 15 min from me. They are wonderful but I am absolutely gutted. I can't stop crying. I feel like the absolute worst person in the world. 
The couple that has them tells me they are still very skittish Theo is being more friendly but Finn, the one that was most attached to me is not eating well and only comes out at night. 
     Has anyone, ANYONE had to rehome their pets for circumstances they have little control over and HOW have you coped ??? All I do is cry. When I remember that they are together I feel a bit better. I have always since I was a child had a hard time understanding that animals don't think and feel the same as people.

Pet guilt ,"I've recently moved to a smaller apartment and have decided its for the best to completely seperste my cats and my dog who have been together for 7 and 3 years (2 cats)  due to a recent accident involving the dog and cat (the dog got irritated with the cat and jumped on her). I feel incredibly guilty that the cats will be baby gated to 2 rooms and the dog will be baby gated to 1 very large (living room + kitchen sized) room. They've always spent so much time together that I feel horrible for separating them (cats and dog watched TV together and slept together). 

I know the dog gets plenty of walks and he sleeps with me.  The cats have plenty of toys and sleeping spots and they have each other with. 

As weird as it sounds I'm worried the cats wil be jealous? Or feel neglected? As irrational as I feel like it is I need to know do other people feel this way? How do you handle it?

Disappointed in Pet Insurance ,"We adopted a 10 y/o blind cat with hypertension and Early kidney disease about 2.5 years ago. Immediately we got pet insurance. We knew it wouldn't cover a lot because she was already diagnosed. The first one we had was so hard to even file claim with that we had to change. She had been diagnosed with Herpes virus before the second one. So basically nothing is covered (literally says vomiting, diarrhea, utis, sneezing, coughing are all not covered). I understand insurance isn't something you pay for when your pet is old but we got her old. I get they have to make money but I am disappointed with the lack of consideration with adopted animals that come with health issues you couldn't have possibly covered before they were pre-existing. I am disappointed in how difficult some of them make it to just file a claim. 

Also she is amazing and is doing very well with stable kidney function still. ",2024-03-21 10:12:30
Introducing cat & puppy,"I’m going to be moving into a place with my boyfriend and I have a 4 year old cat who had a lot of peeing problems in the past, my boyfriend wants to get a dog in the future. What’s the best way to introduce my cat to the new environment and eventually introducing a puppy?

Edit; to clarify the peeing problems, he would pee all over furniture and clothes and everything for his first like 3 years when I was gone. Prozac & more litter boxes and being around 2 other cats has changed this. He seems to enjoy having company (if they’re me or if they’re cats lol) so idk if I should get a kitten so he has a cat friend and then maybe a dog someday later on",2024-03-21 09:39:32

How well do Golden Retrievers get along with Chihuahuas?,"I currently have two Chihuahuas. Rocky (12M) and Eevee (3M). They both have been traumatized by a Pitbull attacking them several times, but Eevee is especially terrified of big dogs. But I'm considering getting a Golden Retriever puppy once I have my own place because Eevee looks like a Golden Retriever and I believe he's mixed with one and I think it'd be good for him to be around one. I'm hoping that if he sees a dog that looks like him and is sweet to him, then he won't be as scared of bigger dogs. 

Rocky has been bullied by a Shih Tzu and Jack Russell Terrier as well as the same Pitbull that traumatized Eevee. But Rocky just likes to go up to big dogs and growl at them to show that he's not scared of them. 

I just wanna be sure that if I did get a Golden Retriever, there wouldn't be any fighting issues. Cause my dogs don't bite. One just runs, and the other growls. 

Edit: This is just a question I'm asking. I'm taking a long time to think about this decision. I haven't even started looking for Golden Retrievers yet. I just wanted to be sure that if I decided to get one, it wouldn't attack my Chihuahuas for not being nice at first. I'm not in the position to get another pet, and I'm not foolish enough to get one anyway. 

It's just a question. Don't assume anything else. ",2024-03-21 07:17:03
"Unexpected diagnosis, advice needed","I took my cat to the vet this morning thinking his sudden loss of appetite and vomiting was probably caused by something he ingested. This cat will eat anything. Monday morning, he snarfed down his breakfast as usual, but by lunch, he wouldn't eat. He sniffed his food and walked away. This was unheard of, so I tried giving him a tiny piece of cheese (which he loves) to see if it was the cat food. Nope. 

My first thought was that he's working on a hairball. He's a Persian, and he gets them every so often, and he was about due. But 24 hrs later, still no hairball. He was drinking water and using the litter box, but he definitely wasn't his usual energetic self. So off to the vet we went, as I braced myself for a very expensive bill and the news that he might need surgery. 

What I wasn't prepared for was that he has lymphoma. They're 99% sure, but they're running another blood test just to confirm. His calcium levels are double what they should be, his kidneys are enlarged, and his white blood cell count is high. The vet gave him an appetite stimulant and a nausea suppressant, with the instructions to try feeding him in a few hours. I've tried, and he still won't eat. Is there anything I do, any tricks you guys might know, to get him eating again? I really, REALLY don't want to have to break the news to my daughter that we have to euthanise her two-year-old cat in the next couple of days so that he doesn't suffer.

TIA. This all happened so suddenly and I'm reeling.

ETA: Thank you all so, so much for your kind notes and suggestions. They've really helped give me a glimmer of hope through this otherwise awful day. I've taken some of the tips and called my vet (left a message with reception as she's in surgery at the moment) to request prednisolone. I also went to the grocery store as soon as it opened this morning to buy some baby food. Currently have it locked and loaded in the syringe, waiting for my cat to wake up from his nap in a place I can't reach him 🙄.

Again, thank you guys. I'll update with news when I have it. 🤞",2024-03-21 05:53:21
"Cat won't stop peeing on bed, even after multiple vet visits","I speculate that it is behavioral, because the cat that keeps peeing (6M) and my other cat (15M) fight a lot, and his way of retaliation is peeing on furniture. We've gone through the vet multiple times: Urinary tract, kidneys, everything. It's 100% behavioral and there's really nothing else we can do. My parents are tired of constantly living restrictively and told me they're thinking of giving him away. I'm very emotionally connected to him, but it's really annoying to me, that once I leave th3 door open once for a few minutes, he jumps in and urinates on my bed.

Pet insurance,"Hi everyone, 

I'm about to get my new puppy next week and are looking into different insurance policies. So far here are the options I have based on the research I have done. If it helps, I live right in the heart of downtown Chicago. 

1. Trupanion: $500 deductible, 90% payout, uncapped annual limit. **$85/month**
2. MetLife:	$250 deductible, 80% payout, $10k annual limit. **$40/month** with Wellness Plan option **$61/month**
3. Spot: $500 deductible, 80% payout, $10k annual limit. **$45/month** with Wellness Plan option	**$55/month**
4. PetsBest: $250 deductible, 80% payout, uncapped annual limit. **$75/month**

This is my first time dealing with pet insurance, so any advice would be appreciated! And for anybody who has ever done a wellness/puppy plan in addition to their insurance, was it worth it? I'm not sure if the vaccines + neutering + everything else that comes with the first few months of puppy life is worth the extra almost $20/month. ",2024-03-21 04:31:02

Has anyone had a bad experience with Chewy.com customer service?,"I bought a product on Chewy that was a 3 month supply. When it arrived, it only had one month till the expiration date (the batch date was two years ago). No biggie, I asked for a replacement. They send one out.

I got the replacement, but it was the same date. I called again and explained. During that call they had no record of my previous call (clearly I had called because there is a free transaction on my account). The new rep told me that they were putting in notes for a manager to check the shelves and personally pack my order, because their policy says they aren't supposed to send out anything that expires within 90 days. The third time (second replacement) the same thing happens. I called back, and lo and behold they can't find the notes from my previous calls. I try one more time, and they say they will send a third replacement, again putting in notes for a manager to pack.

It never comes. I call back and they again have no record of my previous calls (yet I have two free replacements on the account history). So I ask for a refund since they can't seem to send the correct batch. I have the three products, unopened and offered to return them but they said it wasn't necessary. But I am now wondering if I will even get the refund.

Does anyone know if there are magic words if I have to call again to speak to a supervisor? I don't want to complain to the front line worker as it isn't their fault, but a supervisor could at least make sure I get my refund processed.

I have also forgotten to ask for a call reference number, I'll do that next time.

New 4 month old kitten that's shy and hisses.,"Hi I got this cat last February 6 2024.It came from a home where the woman had four kittens to give away and I took the last one.The first day that I took him in,I made a safe room for him with a litter box,food and water.The first few days ,he was meowing and refusing to eat but and using is litter.3rd day I open the safe room door a little open so he could explore my 1 bed room apt.He would come out usually at night when I was sleeping.I got him toys,scratch cat tree and treats.He would play with me a little bit but I couldn't pet him,he won't let me.If would make just a tiny little noice the kitten would run to the safe room under the bed so last Sunday I removed that hiding spot because I heard that it's not normal for a cat to hide all the time so what I did is I dismantle the bed and I made him is small little hiding space which is under a table in the safe room with a blanket covering the table so he can hide when he needs to plus I put a box with a blanket in there.Everytime I walk near him he hisses at me.If I go in his safe room to clean the litter he's not hissing and ok with it.If I go in the safe room and talk to him or try and play with him in the room he hisses.On the other hand if I'm in the living room and start playing with him,he will play but I cannot still pet him.He won't let me.I can give him treats near me and he comes and get it.I can sometimes feed him a treat with my figures and it's ok but if I try to pet him after he takes the treats he's frightened and moves back.When I sleep at night,he jumps on the arm rest of the couch and smells my feet but that's it.I talk to him gently all the time.I give him calming treats and I plugged in a feliway diffuser about a week ago and I just don't understand his behavior.

why is my dog affectionate until others are around?,"basically as the title says. since day 1 my dog chose me as his person. the thing with him though, is, while yes he’ll cuddle up on/next to me while other people are around, he’ll be overly affectionate with me and then move away when people come inside / come in the room.

for example, my mom and dad were outside having a smoke, and my sister was in the backyard. our dog, cruz, climbed into my lap, rested his head on my chest as if he was giving me a hug before laying down. this went on for about five minutes? he then got up, went to hug me again, and then my dad came inside and he immediately left my lap and laid down next to me. i dont mind it im just really curious on WHY he does this and if anyone elses dog does this with them.

"My mom and brother are ""not ready yet"" to put down the family dog (19 year old rat terrier) but he's suffering","My mom (58f) and my brother (29m) live with the family dog, Fivel. He's a 19 year old rat terrier. I no longer live at home, but I visit every few weeks. 

I was talking to my mom last night and she suddenly brought up how Fivel is doing. She said that my brother went to hang out with some friends, and put him in his crate since no one else was home. She came home about 2 hours after that and found him laying in a pile of his own poo in his crate. 

She went on to tell me that this happens fairly often (going potty in his crate and then lying in it), and that it's a lot of work for her to clean him and then his crate and all the bedding. That she's tired after a long day at work and feels bad that he's in his crate a lot. She said that she can't leave him out of his crate because he gets ""stuck"" in random spots of the house. Like he walks into a corner and just stands there until someone calls him or touches him. When I asked about maybe getting him a bigger crate and putting a puppy pad down for him, she said that he's been falling down when pooping these days so she doesn't think that would fix it. When asked, she told me it's been going on for at least a month now.... He broke one of his back legs a year ago and she thinks that's why he's having trouble now. 

After talking more with her, it doesn't sound like she wants to do anything more than praying to help him. I mentioned support slings she could use to help hold him up when pooping, and she said she isn't going to stand outside with him for 20min waiting for him to poop. She also has not told the vet how he's been deteriorating and hasn't taken him in several months. She doesn't trim his nails anymore. And he has a small growth in his forehead that occasionally opens and then scabs over (as well as other lumps and growths on his body, but they don't open). 

When I asked about if they had thought of putting him down, she said they had discussed it but they are not ready yet. I asked if they discussed what would make them be ready, and she didn't really have an answer. 

She wants to talk to me more about it when I see her this Saturday. I'm not sure what to say. It kind of feels like she wants me to tell her she needs to put him down, since we both know my brother will never agree to it until someone says it has to happen. They have had several pets die at home before, even when told they were at the point where euthanasia would have been appropriate. I had to put down my cat 2 years ago before he had even turned 8 because he had a very aggressive cancer. It was heartbreaking, and my mom said she is still upset that God didn't save my cat (she loved him too, he had a big personality and was super friendly). She got defensive when I sent her a link to a quality of life scale for dogs online and asked if I'd want to be put down when I was old and had trouble going to the bathroom. 

What should I say to my mom? Is it too early to say he needs to be put down? He already seems like a shadow of himself, not playing or even able to go on walks, doesn't try to get into things anymore, no longer barks at anything and hardly wags his tail unless you get out a high value treat. He's also lost weight and doesn't care for his kibble much. My mom started giving him canned food to hopefully put some weight back onto him, but it hasn't done much.

Is it normal for an emergency appointment to be a drop off?,"Hey y’all. My cat has been acting oddly over the last two days and so I called her vet to make an appointment. They told me that they only had emergency appointments available and I said that was fine and agreed to pay the higher fee. 

When I got into the office with my unwell, and fairly anxious, cat they told me that it was a drop off and that the doctor would squeeze her in between regular appointments over the next three hours. I reluctantly agreed that this would be okay but I’m currently sitting in my car outside of the vet because I’m anxious. 

The last time I brought her here she had to be taken to the back room to be given a shot, which made me uncomfortable as I’ve always been present for her shots previously. She came home very upset with me and was not herself for several hours afterwards. 

Anyways, all of this to ask, is this typical veterinary behavior? Is it normal to schedule an emergency appointment and then to be told that it’s going to apparently happen sometime within the next three hours? I’m just picturing her sitting in that back room while she’s sick and anxious and it has me feeling very badly about the situation. Any similar experiences would be very appreciated.

Boycott of petsmart,"Hello pet parents! If you aren’t aware, Petsmart has been in the process of doing major restructuring, at the cost of their employees.

Without making you read about ALL the details, I’ll give you a quick synopsis about what’s going down. It has leaked out and was finally announced yesterday that Petsmart would be reducing the employee discount, a discount that already has many rules and caveats to it. Many employees plan a walk out on MARCH 24th, so we ask at least on this day please do not bring your business to petsmart.

"Most people are who pet owners, should not be pet owners. ","This is mostly a rant so mods feel free to remove if it violates anything. I’ve myself never really had pets because I understand the huge responsibility it is to be a pet owner. I know how much time/dedication it really takes to be a good owner, and I know given my schedule/life I would be doing a disservice to an animal if I were to take it in as a pet.

Man oh man I wish more people shared this perspective. I’m a younger millennial/older gen Z, so I’ve had roommates for most of my life. I’ve had too many instances of roommates, who decided to become pet owners who absolutely should not be pet owners. 

One example was a friend who I lived in a tiny two bedroom apartment with who decided she wanted to get a German Shepherd. This already should’ve been a huge red flag because a German Shepherd is not the breed to get for a first time pet owner, and we lived again in a tiny little apartment. Regardless, she didn’t really care and decided to adopt a young German Shepherd from the pound, that was found roaming the streets. God knows how long. Although it wasn’t immediately obvious it became apparent that the dog has serious behavior issues. I’m talking major resource guarding, I felt very unsafe being around this dog. He needed some serious training done none of which she could’ve ever provided herself because she also worked significant hours and so he stayed in his crate for at least six hours a day. After months of her saying she was going to put him into a training program but never doing it because she always spent her money on herself, we ended up moving out anyways so she never was pressured by me to get the dog trained. 

Now years later I have yet another roommate who will leave for weekend trips and expect myself and my other roommate to take care of their dog. They will also leave for 8+ hours a day and the poor dog is just left at home. 

Please people, don’t underestimate how much work/dedication/time it takes to take care of an animal. A lot of people are basically bordering on animal abuse but believe just because the dog isn’t in a shelter it’s better off. ",2024-03-19 02:04:48
"My cat was reported missing, but not by me. ","In 2015 I adopted a cat from a no-kill shelter. They told me that she had previously been adopted from the same shelter about a year before, but was picked up by animal control and brought back after she was found walking on the busy streets around town.  

Recently I moved to a new area, and this weekend it just occurred to me to make sure her microchip was updated with the correct information.  I went to the 24PetWatch website, which the shelter said is the company they used, and I had to make an account first as I had never logged in before.  When I got logged in, it had all of my information, but there was also a banner on the website stating my cat had previously been reported missing and asking me to update her status on whether she was found.  

I have never reported my cat missing, and I am wondering if the original adopter maybe reported her missing when she got picked up by animal control.  I am now worried that the original owner will get my info from 24PetWatch and try to take back the cat, even though I adopted her almost a decade ago and still have the adoption papers from the shelter proving I legally adopted her. 

Do you think this scenario is even possible?  If the previous owner did report her missing, surely the shelter would have contacted the her when the cat was picked up by animal control.  I probably sound paranoid, but I love my cat and don’t want to lose her, nor do I want any drama to come from this. ",2024-03-19 01:07:59

However, they don't know that I'm their next-door neighbor because I left a note on their door asking them to text me. I can't shake off this worry about potential repercussions. What if they get angry with me? What if they actually cared for the cat? And what if it's microchipped, and the humane society contacts the owners?

"Girlfriend wants to leave me, but wants me to keep one of her cats.","So, me and my gf have hit a pretty hard patch in our relationship after 9 years. We were engaged for 1 year, but I won’t get into that. She plans on moving to another state and getting an apartment. She has 2 cats, one black and one tuxedo. We did have a deal involving our relationship, however, she wants me to keep the black cat since it, according to her, chose me as it’s owner. She’s taking the tuxedo cat and told me that it would be $60 for both cats at the apartments she’s moving to, which she can’t afford. And to be honest I really do not want nor do I think I can take care of this cat knowing it was supposed to be “our” cats even though both of them are hers and I already suspect once she gets to her new apartment it’s just going to be a breakup.

Pets like hamsters that live longer?,"So my wife and I were at the pet store today shopping for outfits for our dog and I stopped by the rodent section like I usually do when we go in there. There was this beautiful big girl hamster. I don't remember the species, but she was a bit larger than the other hamsters and she was so inquisitive and cute. My wife said we could get a hamster(s) if I did the research. Well I've been looking at the life expectancy of them and most people say two years with some saying they had their hamsters pass at less than a year due to diabetes and poor genetics. I don't really think I could do that. I mean if there aren't any really good options I'll probably end up getting a couple hamsters from a reputable breeder but I was just wondering if there were any other species that had a little longer lifespan. My wife says no rats cause she's had rats before and they smell. And I can't get a ferret in my state cause yay California. It just sucks they live such short lives cause they really seem like great pets from what I'm reading so far but 2 years is so short and I know it would just break my heart.",2024-03-17 10:31:07

"People, Seriously?","I am very new to this sub and I'm seriously considering leaving already. Why? Because the number of people who come on here, describe some horrible injury/ailment that their animal is going through and then ask what they should do is too damn high. If your animal is in pain, has an obvious injury, has a suspected but not obvious injury, is vomiting a lot, isn't eating, drinking, pooping, peeing or moving on their own, or just isn't acting like themselves in general GO TO A VET. For crying out loud, we once took a cat to the vet because she was meowing more than usual. And if you don't have the money for a regular vet visit (not an emergency; we all know those can be incredibly cost-prohibitive at times) then do not own a pet. Period. Sorry, not sorry. Part of having pets is being able to handle the financial responsibility of their health and care and if you can't do that then do them a favor and rehome them with someone who will. Owning a pet is a responsibility, not a right. And minors of the world, please for the love of God, stop bringing home strays or begging your parents for pets that they have no intention of taking care of. Because until you get an income of your own and can take care of that animal's needs, that financial responsibility falls on your parents. And that may be a responsibility they don't want. If you really want a pet, wait until you're financially responsible for yourself and then get one. Don's strap your parents with a pet they have no intention of taking care of.

I have two dogs and 5 cats. All of them are fixed, UTD on shots and microchipped. Yeah, it's expensive but it can be done. And if you're not willing to do it, find someone who will.

\*Edit: It was recently pointed out to me that there are places in the world where vet care isn't readily available, which I obviously didn't think about. In that case, coming here and asking other pet owners who may have been through the same thing is definitely better than not doing anything at all. ",2024-03-17 02:27:58
What Pet Should I Get? ,"I love animals and I have own several pets in the past, now I live alone and I would like a pet to company me.

My neighbors keep getting purebred dogs. ,"My neighbors keep getting purebred dogs and just leave them in the yard all day. They have 7 different breeds and 5 are very active breeds. They don’t walk them ever and they’re in their yard most of the time. We live in the suburbs with very small yards. These dogs need to run and be walked. I don’t understand why they keep buying them when they’re not gonna take care of them properly… I think they also have a ton of cats too but I can’t say how many. When their windows are open on nice days I can literally smell the inside of their house from the sidewalk… I feel so sorry for these animals. They keep getting them as puppies too! So they’re extra active dogs that just bark all day because they want to be played with. One of the dogs gets walked and it’s not even the active one it’s a Shih Tzu that desperately needs to be groomed.. he’s the only one who gets walked and gets walked multiple times a day and they never pick up the poop. There is a lot of people living there and the person who walks that dog I guess it’s her dog so that’s why she only walks the one and the others are the other family members dogs. I live in a very nice neighborhood and just hit extremely unlucky with my neighbors. I truly think they’re animal hoarders and they’re not even rescuing them they’re literally paying so much for these dogs..

My mom's dogs are driving me insane and I don't know what to do.,"Hi guys.

I (21F) am currently living at home with my parents. Things are overall pretty good, except for my mother's two chihuahuas.

 For some background, my mother strongly believes that chihuahua's don't need to be trained because they are small and ""harmless."" She has never bothered to even attempt to train them, and neither of them are fixed. One is almost twelve, and the other is around five. We live in a condo, so it isn't very big. The older one is now confined to a rabbit pen she got from petsmart and is walked once or twice a day, and the other is trapped in the kitchen (the younger one does not get walked. He is in the kitchen ALL THE TIME.) He constantly barks, and barks, all fucking day. 

 The younger one does not go for walks, because he has a lot of ""anxiety"" even though ive explained to my mom multiple times it's because he isnt used to it and regular exposure to walks etc will help immensely, she never listens to me. She does not care how much that dog affects my mental health.  Every time I go upstairs he barks and barks and tries to attack my legs. I want to move out so badly, but I don't have nearly enough money to do so. I don't know what to do. I feel so trapped and angry because no one in my family cares or seems to realize how neglected these dogs are. There is pee pads all over the kitchen and it makes our house look disgusting. I've been thinking about making a report to animal control, but I don't want my mom to get into legal trouble. 

I just dont understand how she doesn't realize how gross this whole situation is.

"I feel roommates cat is neglected, but don’t know what to do about it","I unofficially moved in with my partner and his two roommates about 3 years ago, and about a year ago one of them got a kitten without telling anyone or getting any permission from the landlord.

He keeps the cat shut in his small messy/ dirty room the whole time, it’s barely left those 4 walls since it was born, apart from occasionally letting it roam free in the room where we all dry our clean washing, whilst he has a shower. It meows and cry’s all day as he works long hours which is breaking my heart, but it’s flea riddled and stinks so I can’t keep it company.

We’ve got fleas all in the house (says he can’t afford treatment when spoken to him), piss on our clean washing and his room contestantly stinks of cat faeces which travels round the house (he also smokes w**d in that room). My clothes stink even after washing and I’m embarrassed people can smell it on me.

I’ve spoken to him about it and he says the cat is fine, the trouble is I genuinely think he adores the cat and looks like he’s feeding it and it has a litter tray in there. I really don’t know what to do about it, it breaks my heart hearing him cry all day knowing what state that room is in. If I call the animal welfare then it will cause HUGE problems between the boys and me and my partner. My parents have said if I can get the cat to them they will look after it, but that will cause problems between me and my partner as well. Help?

What are your stories of how you met your current pet?,"I'd always been a dog kind of guy. I liked cats but I'd never thought about owning one. I started a new job last year in May and the people who lived in the house next door had 9 week old kittens for sale. I didn't really take much notice but one day the lady who lived there asked me if I wanted to meet them while we were casually chatting. There was 4 kittens in total. She was keeping one, another was going to her brother when it was ready and there was two left for sale. The two for sale were cute but didn't win my heart over, but when she shown me the one she was keeping I fell instantly in love. His name is Tigger and he shares my birthday. I held him to my chest and he was nuzzling and purring outright, which even shocked her as she had said he was the most skittish out of all the litter. I said if he had been available I would have outright took him but she assured me the family was keeping him and he wasn't for sale. Roll on a week later and me keep asking if I could see Tigger again and she suddenly changed her mind about keeping him and said if I was serious then he was mine. She wouldn't even accept money when I said I wanted him and just asked for updates and pictures as he grows up. They kept one of the other kittens instead. I picked him up a week later. Apparently her brother was not happy when she told him she was giving Tigger to me as he had wanted him originally but because she had said she was keeping him, he had chosen one of the other kittens instead. So yeah, that's how I met my best friend. And I've still kept the name Tigger for him.

My dog is at the emergency vet. I’m heartbroken and I feel like I’ve failed him.,"Hi all. I’m going to be honest, I don’t really know what the point of this post is. I’m just feeling extremely overwhelmed and heartbroken.

Yesterday, I took my 16yo dog (17 next month) to the vet for a sick visit because he hasn’t been acting himself and has been experiencing a number of symptoms. I admittedly just thought it was going to be a quick visit and we’d be there and back within an hour. I thought it was either him just not liking his prescription renal food or possibly his teeth starting to bother him. It was neither of those things.

In mid-November, he was diagnosed with stage 2 kidney disease. That was followed by a cushing’s disease diagnosis in early January (they ran the tests for it in mid-December, but the diagnosis was delayed due to the holidays). He was put on Vetoryl.

Back to yesterday…it turns out they his creatinine levels had more than doubled, and I had to take him to the emergency vet, where he will be for 24-48 hours to receive fluids to help bring his creatinine levels back down and also be seen by an internist to determine next steps

.The vet told me it’s most likely the Vetoryl that caused the spike in his creatinine levels. And I just can’t help but feel that I failed him. I specifically asked the vet when they prescribed the Vetoryl if it was ok for him to take, because it says right on the box that it should not be given to dogs with kidney insufficiencies. They told that it was fine and they actually expected to see his kidneys improve. I trusted them. But I started trusting them less when I saw how much he changed once on Veotryl. They didn’t seem too worried about. I literally just made an appointment to get a second opinion just days ago. I should have done it sooner. And now he’s at the emergency vet, and I know that if something like this happens again, I won’t be able to afford it. 

Yes, I know I should have pet insurance, but that wasn’t really a big thing when we first got him, and he has another pre-existing condition that for awhile made it seem like pet insurance wouldn’t be worth it. I was looking into getting it just before his CKD and cushing’s diagnosis because of his age.

Again, I don’t really know what the point of this post is. I’m just so extremely overwhelmed (on top of this, I also have a family member in the hospital in critical condition who likely isn’t going to make it).",2024-03-14 21:17:37
My cat hates my boyfriend,"So I think the title says enough, but I’ll dive deeper anyways.
I adopted my cat (Atlas) when he was just a few months old. I was in a long term relationship at the time and Atlas was very clearly raised feral. No human skills, would steal and hide food and various items like q-tips. He quickly became very dependent on social interaction and has been called gregarious by many vets over the years. He just has to be cuddling or close with people all the time. That relationship ended when he was about 2 and I moved to live alone. Well it’s been over a year and a half since then and my new boyfriend comes by and stays at my place 2-3 days a week and half the time brings his chihuahua. I have a large dog as well, so I didn’t think it would be a big deal. At first everything seemed great until Atlas started stalking and attacking the chihuahua about 6 months into this arrangement. I feel like we tried everything from wearing him out with the laser pointer, letting him loose in my backyard for a couple minutes, and giving him even more attention than usual. The chihuahua recently wants nothing to do with coming to my place now, so now my boyfriend just comes over alone. 
I feel crazy for even thinking it, but it seems like my cat is now taking it out on my boyfriend? He’s acting crazy all throughout the day, jumps on bf while he’s sleeping (face and crotch), but still likes to cuddle with him on the couch. I genuinely don’t know what to think. Atlas has never acted like this with dogs or people before. Is there a way to make him calm down or get him more used to other people being around? ",2024-03-14 12:18:20
Traumatized that my mom gave her cat away to the shelter ,"Traumatized that my mom gave her cat away to the shelter 


What started as a simple visit to help my mom care for her 2 cats turned out very toxic for me. I was visiting my mom and her boyfriend to help them take care of the 2 cats (both got sick and didn't get along) who had to be separated. During that time, my mom suggested I rent an apartment closeby, suggesting it would be good for me to live near them, that we could help eachother out, that I could focus more on my personal goals and also take in one of her cats so they don't have issues with eachother. She said that if I don't take the apartment and take in her cat, she will give it away. Where I currently live I wouldn't be able to take in the cat.

The thought of renting a place near my mom seemed very stressful to me and lonely (I had no friends nor other family living in that state), but because I was so attached to her cat, I considered it. However, every time I brought up concerns about stress and doubts for moving there and asked if there was any other way to make it work with the cat, my mom refused and said she would give the cat away, so I kept convincing myself that moving there would benefit me too somehow. During this time, I also noticed that my mom and her boyfriend were not treating me very well, which brought up concerns about how lonely and isolated I would feel living near them. It would have also been a lot more expensive for me, as I have student loan payments.


So I finally told my mom I wanted to back out of getting the apartment. She then started yelling at me, blaming me for the well-being of her cat, saying that I was a selfish person and only cared about myself, that I need serious mental health help, that I inconvenienced her and her boyfriend looking at furniture, etc. Then she told me to leave her house  within 2 days and said she would send the cat to a shelter (where it would be stuck in a kennel). I was deeply hurt by this and worried about the cat, so I begged my mom to let me stay longer to take care of the cat until they find someone and help pay her medical expenses in the meantime. 

My mom agreed, but treated me very poorly during that time, along with her boyfriend. I felt like I was walking on eggshells as the smallest thing would make them snap. They also kept threatening to send the cat to a shelter if I didn't find someone soon enough. It was so incredibly stressful that I was getting panic attacks, heart palpitations, body aches, stomach aches and I was losing my appetite. I finally convinced my mom to set up a temporary partition for the cats and get a second opinion (which I paid for) from another vet to see if the cat could live together. At that point, they agreed to follow the advice of the vet to see if things could work out.

Right after that, I told them I needed to leave to take a break from all this. They then threatened to send the cat to a shelter again and gave me guilt trips as to how they will be able to care for the cat when I am gone and who will watch the cats when they are on vacation (I previously agreed to this before this whole thing happened). 

I then agreed to stay longer. However, things escalated again after the cat was trying to break through the partition and both of them looked angry at me, which stressed me out, so I asked them to be nicer to me, stating that I felt like they were ganging up on me and that I was getting panic attacks. This caused both of them to explode, with my mom's boyfriend saying he can't stand me, my mom yelling at me, telling me that I act like a victim (with me having had cancer, anxiety, etc), that it's my fault her boyfriend is upset and if they break up it's my fault, and that I should leave tonight or tomorrow morning.

This was incredibly hurtful, but I also felt relief being able to leave the situation. After I purchased a ticket to leave for the next two days, they both started acting nicer to me and kept bringing up how stressful it would be finding someone to take care of the cats and pet sit when they are on vacation. I didn't react and stuck with the plan to leave. It was my understanding that during this time my mom and her boyfriend would work on following the vet's advice on slowly reintroducing the cats and wait to find her a home before sending her to a shelter.

Now that I am back, I felt a lot more peace, but still worried about the cat I was deeply attached to. When I reached out to her to see how the cat was doing, she told me they put her in a shelter (no kill) where she would be stuck in a kennel! My mom then put the blame on me for everything, saying because I left and wouldn't pet sit, they had to put her in the shelter! I previously agreed to fly back to pet-sit both cats, but just couldn't stay there while both of them were there due to the toxic environment I was in. 

Now I am deeply disturbed at the rash decision they made to send the cat to the shelter (when they could have put more effort to try to make it work as they said they would or at least kept them separated until finding the cat a proper home). I feel like they did this to get back at me for leaving and I feel an enormous amount of guilt.

Did I make the right decision not getting the apartment near them? I currently live with a family member who said they can't take in the cat. Should I still try to adopt the cat from the shelter and try to convince them otherwise?  How can I manage this guilt I have? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated 🙏.",2024-03-14 07:23:29

I get that animals will be animals, but I've had dogs all my life and really enjoyed them but wanted a cat now cause I live in an apartment and can't walk a dog every few hours.

How does my cat know when I need to wake up? ,"This is repetive and I honestly don't know how he does it.

I have a 7 month old kitten. Because my sister has to wake up for school at 7:15am, but I don't until 11am (& I'm usually up late), my stepdad will let my kitten out of his carrier. He feeds my kitten when he feeds the other cats and he'll play with the kitten until I wake up. 

About half an hour before I need to wake up, every day, my kitten will somehow get out of the living room (even if the door is closed), and come upstairs to my bedroom, and then will sit outside my door screaming at me until I wake up. And it's every day. If my schedule changes and there's a different time I need to get up than usual? He wakes me up at that time instead.

I don't know how he does it and it's stressing me and my family out not knowing 🤣. We know WHY (he wants cuddles before I start my day so always wakes me up a little earlier than needed) but not HOW. 

Edit : It's not a routine, though that was my first thought, because the times vary each day/week. I might need to wake up at 7am on Saturday one week, then the next at 10am, and my cat always knows on the exact day despite it regularly changing. If the cat isn't in the carrier, he won't sleep at all and he'll keep everyone awake. We have people who have college and school so they need sleep. He's perfectly fine with it and a VET is fine with it. It's a temporary thing until he gets used to when bedtime is. Our older five are allowed to roam freely, and he'll be allowed when he knows when bedtime is. We don't force him to. If he's uncomfortable, we would of course let him out for some time. If I wake up during the night (as I do often) I always let him out for a few minutes. ",2024-03-13 05:06:33
Is this the case that I should call animal control,"Hi.

We have a neighbor's house with a pitbull who is always hanging around outdoors. I've never seen the dog put inside the home or kept with his family. Last winter, the snow was heavy here, and I saw the dog still outside until 3 AM, barking all day. I've never seen him inside the house when the owners are absent. He usually takes a nap around the backyard but is not getting any attention from his family. I saw the neighbor recently got a new puppy in my eyes, and the kid said, ""I'm so sorry, but I can't,"" and kept playing with the new puppy without glancing toward the pit bull. The pitbull kept jumping and crying crazy while the kid was distancing himself from the dog, and the family didn't even give a look when they came back from a trip. I'm afraid that's purposeful. The pitbull seems extremely stressed lately, he barks almost every night when there's nobody. Should I call the animal control?",2024-03-13 03:41:47
"Dog had a seizure this morning, not sure what to do.","This morning my fiancée and I were woken up by our dog seizing on the bed, full seizure; convulsions, salivating, shit and pissed on the bed. When he came out of it my fiancée tried to hold him down so he wouldn't hurt himself, and he bit her.

​

I called the emergency vet, and I am now aware that this was a bad idea. It's been about 2 hours, and the dog still doesn't trust me to get close. Doesn't respond to his name, looks at me, and growls if I move closer. He's in the bedroom on his own to keep him and the cats separate, and I was initially checking in on him every 10 minutes or so, I've slowed that down to give him space.

​

The emergency vet said they cannot diagnose it unless he has another seizure, and I scheduled an appointment with our regular veterinarian per their recommendation. I cannot get close to the dog, so I'm just sitting outside the door listening for him to have another seizure. Does anybody have any advice.

Update:

He's doing much better. Took him about 4 hours to calm down enough to approach us. He's now kissing us, and letting us gently pet him, but he's a little skittish, more than usual. We're still taking him to the vet today, and we're going to be monitoring him to make sure all is ok.",2024-03-12 21:08:10

Every time she goes away, she assumes that either I, or my brother, or both of us will look after her cat. Her cat has feline aids and has to remain indoors, so has to be seen/fed every day. I don't really have a bond with this cat and I'm allergic to cats (lol) but my brother has 3 cats.

Every time the inevitable assumption pops up, she says something along the lines of: ""I'm going away for x amount of days, remember, so the cat will need looking after - I'll leave you to speak to your brother to sort it out OK?""

It might also be worth me mentioning that my memory has gotten quite bad over the years and I have forgotten to feed the cat on a few occasions. I work, I have a toddler, I have a dog of my own that I need to walk, a house to clean and clothes to wash, and shit to do. So you can imagine that over the last few years when my baby was very small, having to make trips in the car and bring the car seat in the house to feed this damn cat has left a bad taste in my mouth. It is also worth mentioning that the cat does NOT like my toddler and has hissed/tried to scratch her a couple of times.

So, with all of this in mind, I sent her the following message:

""I'm sorry but I'm not going to commit to feeding the cat this time. I just know I'm going to struggle. As you know I'm working more hours now, and later in the day. Working these shifts plus managing the household, walking the dog and looking after (my kid) - it's a lot for me to manage, especially with me coming off my medication and my memory being poor. I hope you understand and if you can let (brother) know on my behalf. Thank you""

Her response was:

""That's a real let down. I'm away nearly 3wks. That's a lot to put on (brother).  Surely you can see to (cat) once or twice a week at least? I don't ask for much. I understand you're busy but so am I.  I do things to help you. It's all I ask in return. I appreciate it if you will try your best.""

By ""do things to help you"", she means she pays for 2 x half days at Daycare for my child while I go to work, because I can't afford it otherwise. (On the other days that I work, my MIL babysits.)

What can I say back in response?

I'm F32, brother is M40 mother is F63.

Edit:

  
Thanks for your replies everyone, it's taken a lot for me not to feel like shit about this! I'm just going to put up and shut up, and feed the bloody cat. Lol.

Just wana clarify a few things though, for my own peace of mind if anything:

My partner and I can afford to pay for daycare, I don't know why I put that I can't - we paid for the first few months when I decided to go back to work - but a few months in, my mam asked if she can start paying towards it because she felt guilty for not spending more time with my kid/her grandchild, since she is always on holiday (in comparison to MIL who sees her 2-3 times a week). So I said sure.

I've been feeding the cat for years now, and even with multiple alarms and reminders on my phone - I still do forget - with working shifts, weekend work, walking the dog and my chilrd's daily routine (not to mention potty training at the moment!). Sometimes I'm literally about to walk up the stairs for bed, when I suddenly remember & I have to run out in the car to sort him. One time I forgot that she was on holiday and my brother thankfully popped round anyway & noticed the food bowl was empty. I've felt absolutely awful when that's happened.

""Ungrateful"" was my mam's favourite word for me growing up, that word is a massive trigger for me. She raised me as a single mum but she shouted at me, hit me, hit my brother, and we are now grown adults with mental issues. But, as this is [](https://www.reddit.com/r/pets/) not [](https://www.reddit.com/r/unresolvedtrauma/), I'll just stop there!

Thanks again for your replies. I can't take my mam telling me I'm wrong, but I will take it when it's multiple strangers - LOL.",2024-03-12 08:26:23
Is $700-$900 reasonable for a cat dental cleaning?,"My older orange boy is in need of a dental cleaning. When looking up average payments online, I saw that a dental cleaning should cost between $200-$500

My current vet sent me the cost estimate for a dental cleaning, and after all fees and such, the total estimate is between $700-$900

I will pay for the procedure regardless of cost, but am I paying too much? I’ve heard from friends with cats that this sounds pretty expensive, and they’ve commented on my past vet bills being pretty pricey.

Does this estimate from the vet seem reasonable?

This should include sedation, boarding, medications, and the procedure",2024-03-12 03:58:58
Bought a puppy and I feel morally wrong ,"Let me first say that I’m pro adoption and always reminding people why is it important.
But a month ago I went to the pet store to buy shampoo for my dog and I ended up buying a puppy. 
The thing is that he is the puppy that nobody wanted, he was the older puppy in the store and was already $900 off of his original price. 
My fiancé heart people calling him ugly and the poor thing was so scared that he kept walking with his tail between his legs. 
I just couldn’t leave him there and had to bring him home with me. 
I feel morally wrong for buying a dog but I just know I would feel even worse leaving this cutie behind.

Edit: I do not live in the US, in my city by-law pet stores must obtain their dogs, cats and rabbits exclusively from shelters or veterinary clinics. 

Edit: After reading multiple comments I did further investigation and I’m literally copying pasting what’s written on the pet store website.
I’ll not named any organizations to avoid any problems.
“ (Organization name) also inspects our stores regularly and randomly to ensure compliance with strict regulations the government has put in place to keep domesticated animals safe and healthy. (Pet store) does not condone ""puppy mill"" operations, nor do we deal with any puppy mills.

Thank you so much for everyone comments, I can finally have some peace of mind. 

I can assure you that this pup is being spoiled, pampered and he will be provided with the best care for the rest of his life. ",2024-03-11 21:33:08
My dog ran away and I’m struggling,"UPDATE: My dog was found today. Someone put the dog in the garage.. My FIL found him when he went to run errands this afternoon. They didn’t knock on the door or anything which was super weird, but I’m so happy he’s home!! 

I am so sad. We were visiting family out of state. My soon-to-be 14 year old dog always come with me when we travel; he has been there before and loves it. My son and I took him swimming in the creek and he got muddy afterwards. We all had so much fun.

I cleaned his paws and was just waiting for them to get dry. He went up to the door to be let in (normally he will just lay at the door or next to me until we go inside). My husband came out of the house a minute later with my youngest. I told him that I was just waiting for his paws to dry and then I was going to let him in.

Two minutes went by and I noticed that my dog wasn’t by the door. I asked my husband if he had let him inside and he said no. I went around to the front door thinking that he snuck to the porch to wait there. Not there.

My MIL thought my husband maybe let him in and wasn’t paying attention so I looked inside in all the usual hiding spaces. Under beds, in the shower, on the couch. He was nowhere. He has never, ever run away before. I used to take him hiking off leash with me. Everyone used to smile when they saw us because he would always be looking up at me smiling.

I had an entire search party of neighbors looking for him. I went up to other people blocks away. I had a friend make a social media post. No one saw him. I contacted animal control multiple times, local vets, and the HOA Office. I put a pile of dirty laundry on the front porch.

My husband, FIL, and I searched for 4 days before we had to go back home. Their neighbors are still looking. My dog has their name and my name and phone number printed directly on the collar.

I’m so sad. He gets treats everyday from the kids, he used to sleep with my 4 year old every night, he’s  my hiking buddy, he’s been on every plane ride with me. He has never, ever ran away. EVER. When people tried to take him on walks, he would literally lay his body down and wait for me to be next to him.

He has been with me for basically my entire adult life. He has been there through moves, job losses, loss of family/friends, and the addition to our family. When I was pregnant with my 4 year old, he knew before anyone did and followed me everywhere - including the shower. Once he was born he slept close to him and continued until he went missing. My 4 year old cries every night.

I knew that he was getting up there in age, but I always thought I would be able to be there with him at the end. To hold him, to make sure he had a comfortable end. Not like this. Not with me not knowing if he got hurt or starved or suffered. I was just waiting for his paws to dry! He was at the door. I am so sad. I miss him so very much.",2024-03-11 12:53:11
Is it okay to cage a cat for a few hours once a month?,"I have to move back with my parents and currently don’t have money for a cat tree so I refurbished an old very large rat cage. There’s carpet and a basket and blankets and I’m planning to add toys as well before I move. I also figured I could put her cat food at the higher level so my dog doesn’t get to it. The thing is, my parents have cleaners coming once a month and don’t want the pets to be running around. My dog is crate trained so he’ll be fine but I don’t know how it works with cats. Would it be okay to keep her in the cage for a few hours once a month? Otherwise it’ll always be open and she has free roam of my part of the house if I’m not home, and can free roam the rest of the house when I am home and watching her (parents concerned for furniture) ",2024-03-11 04:56:40
"What do vets do when you’ve paid for dogs surgery, but due to complications rack up 2k more that you can’t afford?","My dog had surgery the other day and I paid the amount I was told beforehand. Of course no one was expecting complications & now my dog has had to stay a little longer. Resulting in $2000 of more charges. We’ve paid this vet over the last 7 months probably 4K for diagnostics and testing and follow ups. Avoided surgery until it was absolutely necessary. Got together over $7k for surgery and paid it. They called today telling me it’s right at $9k now. I’m a wreck wondering what to do now.. credit is out the window due to biting off more than I could chew when I was younger. Me and my husband did a debt relief program to settle credit cards but unfortunately that ruined my credit for now. Already borrowed money from family over the last 7 months getting to this point. What do vets do in these situations? They wouldn’t make payment plans for surgery, which is understandable but I doubt they will for this 2k either. ",2024-03-11 00:26:56
WWYD? DOG ABANDONMENT!,"upon taking my pupparonis to a local dog park, we came upon a pup and a park ranger who quickly let us know said pup had been abandoned there for hours. no leash/ no collar, etc. he asked if we’d like to take her, we had already been looking into fostering/ taking on another so after seeing how she fell in with our pups we ultimately said yes and brought her home ( where she’s doing phenomenal might i add ). being precautionary we took her to a vet to make sure she was up to date and have everything she needs! while there they scanned for a chip, and guess what, SHE HAS ONE! woop, they call the owner who says a family member took her to the dog park and LEFT HER THERE because she was “too dirty” to get into the car, but he didn’t have time to talk about this because he was at work and quickly hung up. he didn’t ask where she was, who found her, if he could come get her, nothing! but there are laws in my state that say it’s stealing if you take someone’s stray, wwyd?

Irresponsible Pet Acquisition,"Having read many posts, I am growing frustrated by the lack of forethought given to the needs of living creatures who are *forced* to be dependent upon human care.

Too many people get a tank (or cage or leash) and then ask what creatures could be held captive in it for their entertainment.  Too many people impulse-buy a living creature without a clue as to the developmental needs it has.  Too many people get overwhelmed or bored and then dump their pets.

I am getting angry at the lack of responsibility shown, even by well-intentioned folks who are just ill-equiped to meet a pet's needs.

Reading the pamphlet at the pet store is not sufficient.  Getting conflicting advice from blogs isn't very helpful either.  Do research at sites by professionals who aren't selling you pet products!  Do in-depth research *before* you get a pet!

Living creatures under human control (and totally dependent on said human) deserve the best care possible - it is up to the human to know what that will entail and whether they are capable of providing it for the life of their pet.

Mom won't take cat to the Vet,"My brother and I have both expressed concerns that our cat may be ill.

The cat has been vomiting for months now, I think. He has recently become much more social and has just now started a strange habit of eating random things such as pillow fuzz and carpet. He eats a lot of food throughout the day. We tried to see if maybe taking away a bowl would help, but he constantly munches on it. He even seems to have anxiety whenever we clean the space and his food is gone.

Overall, I am very concerned about my poor, sweet kitty. He is seven and should have already gone to the vet for at least a checkup, but we are poor because of our excessive spending habits that my mom argues are necessary, even though I think we could cut back on them.

How do I get her to listen?",2024-03-09 22:11:49
"Parents brought home new puppy on impulse, help","We have a new Akita that my parents got, just as the title says. She's 2 months old, and it's been very chaotic. We also have a cat who my parents have also tried to introduce to the puppy, but that went very bad because they forced the cat into it. I've had to take a large portion of caring for the puppy despite not even wanting the puppy in the first place because I was worried of becoming the main caretaker of her. I simply don't have the time to put towards a new puppy in the first place because college, and it requires me to give her my full undivided attention just to watch her due to said very poor vision. It's been a big struggle having to simply monitor her alone.

I'm worried about taking care of the poor girl when I'm not even certain this family is prepared for another pet. I can barely even make myself breakfast sometimes because of poor vision, and yet I'm the one who seems to be expected to put in the most work into raising her(10 hours today). I don't know what to do, am so so tired, and I have no plan outside of making sure the cat and puppy are introduced properly(has been going much better since that first attempt from before). I've read basic things but the exhaustion has been making it a little hard to properly absorb everything. So much work was thrown on me without my input, and the days have been exhausting. The only thing I could imagine was either calling the vet or on here for some input. Anything would be appreciated, thank you for your time.",2024-03-09 16:23:43

My GF’s dog is terribly trained and it’s getting too much,"Hi, my gf’s dog (technically id her sister’s but now its the whole family’s dog) is horribly trained. He has extreme separation anxiety because he never sleeps and is never left alone. My gf’s mother sleeps on the couch with him every night and if she’s not there than my gf, her sister, or even I have to sleep there with him otherwise he barks and cries and wakes up everyone. They also give him food from the table and dont really ground him when he tries to eat stuff from the table. He tries to eat everything and puts himself in danger sometimes when he eats chocolate stuff. I think a big part of the problem comes from my gf’s family not trying to resolve the issues or just ignoring them completely. What could be done? How could his behavior be changed?

Why am I preemptively crying about my dog’s death?,"She’s only 3 and a half and in perfect condition, she’s the first thing that I’ve (22f) ever come to truly love. Got her a little over a year ago during an incredibly rough transition period in my life, she’s my solace.

On our evening walk today, I just broke down crying. The thought of having to make the decision when it’s her time, the idea of losing her little pitter-patters forever without warning, the thought of her not knowing why she has to go. Thinking about it is a daily occurrence basically since I got her a year ago, sometimes it’s a quick thought that I can shake off or distract from, but other times it’s like a plague that renders me almost helpless. I can’t spend the next 10 years living like this, it will destroy me.

Why is this happening? What do I do? Is there any way I can get rid of this unnecessary heartache? Please help me, I don’t know what to do anymore.

I love my dog but he’s bankrupting me,"My dog has very bad allergies. We have spent $16,000 on vet bills alone over the last 3.5 years with a combination of immunotherapy and other pharmaceuticals trying to get it under control. Immunotherapy hasn’t worked and we are now left with the option of trying just pharmaceuticals which would mean spending $500 a month for JUST prescription meds that may or may not work. We feed raw because he does not do well on kibble so his food bill is about $250-$350 a month (85lbs). We have also spent so much on training and behaviour because he has been very uncomfortable and difficult to train. I have cried so many times the first two years we had him. He is better with training now but he has fears due to his discomfort and all the negative experiences at the vet (needles, so many needles, anal glands, ears). This has been a sad and draining experience. On top of it he has been recently diagnosed with a spine issue and pain meds are required as he is in obvious pain. We are meeting with the vet to discuss if humane euthanasia is an option. I am not sure if she will agree. Which makes me feel helpless and hopeless. Rehoming isn’t an option. We know this bill will not be paid by the average pet owner. There is no pet insurance so it’s all pre-existing. And I’m not willing to rehome him only for him to suffer more than he already is as we have been making sure he gets what he needs.

Vet said it’s time to consider rehoming…is it really hopeless?,"My sister adopted a 4 year old cat 8 months ago into her dog and cat household. We immediately separated the resident animals from the new cat and did a slow introduction through the door.

Everything’s ok with the door closed, but once the two cats see each other, they start getting aggressive. One time they had a fight ending with the resident cat’s fur all over the ground. The resident cat will no longer go near the new cat, and she has been visibly anxious and peeing on the bed.

The new cat is stuck in his room because he will seek out the resident cat and fight when he’s let out. We haven’t even begun introducing the dog.

We’ve tried positive reinforcement with treats and swapping smells and Feliway. None seem to work.

Last time we took the resident cat to the vet, the vet suggested anxiety meds but said if they don’t work, it’s time to consider rehoming.

I considered moving the cat into my household with my cat, and have just begun the introduction process. My cat seems to be curious and doesn’t show aggression at all, but the new cat does. I’m afraid the whole thing will go down the same.

Is it hopeless or should I keep trying in hopes that the new cat will get along with my cat?",2024-03-05 23:04:42

Eventually she started coming out but wouldn’t let us touch her. 

Now, 1 year later she purposely gets in the way of my 2 harmless dogs just so she can hiss and bite them, she pisses and shits in our plants, even after using the tinfoil trick, she bites if you touch anywhere but her face, she refuses to play, she won’t accept treats, she meows like crazy if she doesn’t get her *expensive* wet food by 8 o’clock. We’ve tried our absolute best to pamper this cat but we haven’t gotten anywhere. My girlfriend has owned a few cats previously and my family constantly jokes around about her being an animal whisperer because she is unbelievably good with animals, apparently her magic touch doesn’t work on our cat.

Is it my fault my dog was euthanized?,"Our family just had to put our dog of 11 years down yesterday due to a bladder obstruction and I would like to know peoples thoughts on the situation as I am feeling a lot of guilt/regret.

She only started having this issue 2 years ago, around the time another cat was brought into the house and I started a new job. Since then my cousin took the other cat because they did not get along. I thought maybe that was it but it’s been 2 years since then (the other cat was removed fairly quickly once realizing they hated each other), and still the problem is persisting. The only progress made was when I tried Dr Elsey’s Cat Attract litter, which worked like a miracle for 6ish months, and then randomly one day she decided to stop using it. Now, she poops wherever she wants to pretty much, never really in the same place and always random. However, she does almost consistently pee on a pee pad that is next to her litter box, except for a few times when she has peed on a blanket left out or something.

Please help, I need a miracle. I am tired of scrubbing my floors everyday and spending thousands of dollars for nothing to change. My stepmom insists that the only thing left to do is admit to myself that it will never resolve and to look into behavioral euthanasia. But that seems extreme and I love my cat, I don’t know why she does this and I am willing to try anything at this point. My roommates are fed up and don’t want to resign a lease with me because of this, which I can’t blame them because I wouldn’t want to live in a house covered with cat poop either. This is ruining my life, please help.

Roommate is Starving Her Cat,"My roommate got her cat months after we moved in together. One thing led to another and my roommates' cat stresses one of our cats out enough that she's on anxiety meds. After trying to get her to help reintroduce them and it falling on deaf ears, and a comment about how we're the one always taking care of her cat, the cat is now bound to her room. 

My roommate will leave for days at a time without telling us, and where she's always in her room, we don't even notice. She doesn't tell us to feed her cat, and the poor baby has went 24 hours before one of us noticed she was alone. Her water is often dirty. Her litter box is saw dust 24/7. She smokes with the cat in there. And it stinks like you wouldn't believe. I have some proof of her never being here (Life 360), and I've taken pics of her living conditions. 

What do I do? Am I overreacting? When we told her she left her cat for 36 hours without telling us, she said oops sorry I forgot. ",2024-03-05 00:34:01
Should I get my male kitty( 9 months) neutered?,"My 9 month old baby boy has been weird lately. I know about petting aggression but recently when he's had a petting session and kneading on my blanket he suddenly gets extremely hyperactive and aggressive - he starts meowing loudly like he does when he's asking for sth, and attempting to bite my arm like a chew toy and keeps trying to pounce on me. He also does this weird thing like his whole rear body starts quaking like he's spraying urine or sth but then he doesn't spray anything. Is he mad at me or hurt ? 🙁 Should I get him checked?

My cat has stopped purring completely since I stopped letting her out.,"Ever since I decided to restrict my cat from going out, she has stopped purring completely. I tried walking her on a leash but that's not possible because the stray dogs near my house keep coming after her to play. But she gets scared and doesn't walk.

Then, I fixed up my balcony so she can spend time there. But she doesn't like it much. Even tried growling and biting me when I tried letting her out there.

I'm at a complete loss. She seems really unhappy at times at home and has become very restless. I play with her and she has plenty of toys. When I'm playing with her or she's playing in general, she's fine. But she doesn't purr at all anymore and doesn't look very happy about the arrangement.

Are there any ethically “caged pets”,"I adore animals, my current landlord only allows “caged animals”. 
I’m not sure what exactly this means, I’m hoping/assuming it is any animal which can be *ethically* kept as a pet while living in a cage the majority of the time.

I wondered if there are any (ethically) “caged pets”?

I don’t have access to a grassy garden but have a fair bit of indoor space for “cage”, as well as patio if needed.

I’d rather not rescue a hamster (again), they aren’t the best fit for my anxiety due to their inability to show clear signs of sickness and stubborn love of hiding in walls/permanent fixtures.

At my absolute limit with my cat peeing in my bed,"So my boy, Toast roughly 1 1/2 - 2 and neutered, has started peeing in my bed when me and my partner are asleep. Sometimes multiple times a night.

He recently had a urinary crystal flair up and had to take a couple trips to the vet over the last two weeks. It’s all under control now but almost nightly he pees in my bed, generally on top of the covers/us. I know it’s not a uti because of all the recent vet visits/checks, so it’s most likely behavioral.

The little love is on fluoxetine for his anxiety and I have been giving him gabapentin since the crystal issue as I don’t want a resurgence. He’s also on a medicated diet for his urinary issues (mainly the wet food but I do also have the dry kind and leave it out for him too)

Everything I’ve done so far to negate the issue:

- new litter box in a new part of the apartment 

- treats every time I see him using the litter box

- cleaning all the bedding with an enzymatic cleaner before washing with detergent and vinegar 

- playing and cuddling before bed

- covering my mattress in a non-absorbing cover while I’m gone

- scooping and changing the litter a few times a day to keep clean and empty

I’m going to pick up a new type of litter today (heard good things about the walnut litter) and also a Feliway diffuser (very mixed reviews but I’ll try anything)

I genuinely don’t know what else to do. I’m so exhausted and stressed about the whole situation that it’s come to the point where I’ve even considered rehoming my sweet boy but I don’t think I could handle that emotionally.

Also of note, I can not lock him out of the room with the bed because I live in a 370sq ft studio apartment and all of it is just one room and a tiny bathroom.

I desperately need guidance if there’s something I’ve missed, I just want my sweet boy back on track and I will absolutely try anything ",2024-02-29 03:24:14
AITA for wanting my dog not to sleep in the bed with us anymore?,"We adopted this sweet boy, Chester, back in September. He’s a 100 pound 5 year old lab/shepherd/something mix and he’s an old soul. He’s pretty lazy but he’s a good boy. He has slept in the bed with us since day one because that’s what his previous owner did (she was elderly and had to go into assisted living, that’s why we adopted him) and our hearts hurt for him because he didn’t understand what was going on.
Fast forward to now, my husband and I both sleep HORRIBLY because he is either under or on either of our feet and legs at any given point in the night. He will not sleep parallel to us in the middle, he has to be stretched out on the foot of the bed or curled up. Getting him to move is like pulling teeth, I think he pretends not to hear us. It eventually leads to me kicking or firmly nudging him to move but he just goes on my husband’s side and it’s a vicious circle all dang night. 

-He is crate trained but his crate does not fit in our room and is out in the living room.
-We have tried putting his bed in our room on the floor but that was never going to work lol
-Sometimes after being kicked out of bed by one of us in our sleep, he will get off the bed and go to my husband’s side and whine at him (which usually results in Chester giving up and getting back on the bed to fall asleep)

And a big part of me feels bad because that’s all he’s known, sleeping on the human bed. Also please don’t give me the “dogs aren’t here forever, let them sleep with you” stuff, because I am sleep deprived because of a dog. We love him. We need a solution!",2024-02-28 11:35:21

I just don't see how people can afford pets today,"I just think it's sad there's so many homeless pet animals in shelters and stores, and fewer people who even have the funds to take proper care of their needs. When I look into a pet store for example, some of the animals by itself is relatively affordable, but the n when you have to buy the proper setups, food, toys, equipment, vet care, it just makes people say ""nevermind"". When I do see people with pets they struggle to even feed and take care of themselves because their pet takes up more of their expenses. Obviously it's not the animals fault, but I do really wish pet care was more affordable so these animals can have permanent homes. ",2024-02-27 03:46:22

Usually awesome veterinary office is acting strange.,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the appropriate sub, but I’m not quite sure where else to ask. 

I’ve been with my vet for almost 10 years now. They’ve been amazing with my dogs and I’ve never had any issues before until recently. I brought my dog in a few weeks ago for a routine checkup where they discovered a mass that may be cancerous. I scheduled for the next week when our regular vet would be in since he is the higher authority in cancers. He did find what he said appeared to be spindle cells, and a mass removal was scheduled. She has since had it removed and is recovering well. 

Prior to this, my dog had been diagnosed with a mild case of arthritis in her knee, and I was told by the vet that she would recommend a joint support. I was expecting it to be on the after visit, but it wasn’t, so I called and asked about it and the receptionist said she’d check the notes and email me when she could. I was instead emailed a prescription for a muscle relaxer that was also sent to chewy, who rejected it. When I brought it up as a concern, all anyone did was deny that it was sent by the office, even though it came from their email address, and that they didn’t even know how to do that. 

The next problem I had was with scheduling my dog for the mass removal. The same receptionist kept insisting that my dog was put down for a spay, even though I tried telling her that it was incorrect, and that she had already been spayed. She eventually confessed that she had read the chart wrong, and corrected herself, but the next week after surgery, when I came to check in and retrieve my dog at the time they said I could, she referred to it as a spay once again. I brought this up with the vet, as I was concerned about someone else possibly having their dog scheduled for an incorrect procedure. I was told that if I felt it was necessary and wasn’t satisfied with my pets care, that I could go to another vet. This feels like a completely unnecessary escalation when all I am trying to do is communicate some rather distressing concerns I am having with reception.

I got curious and looked through their online reviews and dug under the obviously overwhelming amount of positive reviews and discovered that lower star ratings were almost always related to the receptionists but not the service of the veterinarians. Their responses to the criticism is honestly a little concerning, and I found one review with a response where they demanded the review be taken down and that they were not comfortable doing business with clients who leave bad reviews. This was especially concerning since the review was, once again, related to the performance of the receptionists and not the veterinarians. 

I want to add that I’m not in any way trying to make this clinic look bad, nor am I trying to demonize veterinarians in any way. This whole experience has just been super weird. I don’t know how this all came about over raising a few concerns. Now, I’m super uncomfortable with going to my vet, especially when it’s so pressing now with my dog’s current condition, and the fact that we’re due back to have her stitches removed. I’m now considering switching, however, this clinic is held in such high regard in my area, that it’s going to be difficult to find another after so long of being at the same one. I’m very confused and heartbroken among other things and I would really appreciate any insight that you all have.",2024-02-24 21:03:49
Is it fair to move an unhealthy 20 year old cat across country?,"I’m going to be moving in just over a month across the country (almost 2400 km/1500 miles away), and I’m debating whether it’s fair to my cat to try to bring him or not. He’s almost 20, has hyperthyroidism, terminal kidney disease, he’s extremely skinny and is pretty much completely deaf, and has so much pain from arthritis that he needs opioids daily. The last vet visit we were told “just to make him comfortable” but that was probably 5 months ago, so it’s hard to say how much longer he might live. We are considering taking him on a flight, I’d bring him in cabin, but there are no options for direct flights so it’d likely be 8 hours of travel minimum. The other option is bringing him by car, but that would likely be 4+ days. I’m worried though that the stress of travelling will do him in. My partner’s parents  have offered to take him, but I’m not sure how he’d do with that either, they have a dog (we don’t) and he’s so old and confused I’d worry he’d constantly be looking for us :( On top of that, I have a three year old son who loves his kitty and I just don’t know what to do. We were really hoping he’d go on his own before the move, but it seems like that might not happen. What would you do?

Update: I really appreciate everyone sharing their thoughts, for those saying his quality of life sounds like it’s too low right now, the last time he saw the vet he didn’t suggest euthanasia yet (we specifically asked about it). We definitely don’t want to prolong his life if he’s suffering. We’ve talked about it and decided we’re going to take him to the vet again for a check up and ask whether he thinks it would be humane to try and move with him.",2024-02-24 19:44:23

I want to confront my neighbour about how poorly he treats his dog - Are his actions considered abuse?,"My neighbour purchased a puppy husky that is being severely neglected. He is about 8-10 months old now.

This dog is very skinny. I'm aware huskies are generally lean, but you can see his ribs and hip bones. He is being fed a really unbalanced raw diet. They give him a brick of ground beef for example, no organs, bones, vegetables etc. 

My main concern is that his owners NEVER take him on walks ever, and I mean never.  

In the summer, he was left tied up on the porch in the sweltering heat for hours on end, day after day. A concerned citizen called Animal Services (bylaw) and they did nothing. Now this winter, this dog is frequently left on the back balcony for hours on end with no water or shelter, just lying there or circling. He also wears a shock collar. 

The most exercise the owners gave him was walk him across the street for 5 seconds to relieve himself and walk him back to the house. Well now they have stopped even doing that and now he is being forced to relieve himself on the tiny back balcony which is like 6x6ft, the same balcony where he spends a lot of time. They won't even let him use their backyard to exercise. The owners have been approached with concerns from citizens but they have responded negatively and seem completely disinterested in fulfilling this dog's basic necessities of a healthy diet and regular exercise. I'm honestly worried this dog is going to go crazy and be put down eventually from his lack of mental and physical stimulation.

The situation is very sensitive because people in the neighbourhood want to help this poor dog but want to keep the peace on the street for fear of retaliation. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation? Is this considered ""abuse"" over ""neglect""? I really want to get my facts straight before I approach the owners.",2024-02-24 06:33:18

Better to rehome cats then let them outside?,"My sister has 2 cats that they have had for awhile

One will not use a litter box. Changing litters , locations , ammount of boxes , shapes of boxes , hasn't helped.
 The previous owner was in the veterinarian field and this was the reason they gave her away to my sister, not even vets could help. 
The other is just an asshole with aggressive nature.

Now that they have a young daughter the shitting had become a danger. The cat will shit in bed , on you , in couches, pillows , anywhere on the floor.  The vets have nothing for them. Calming scent and pheromone products haven't worked. CBD hasn't helped. And when the baby is older the aggro cat could become an issue too.

She does not want to rehome them. She thinks no one will want them. I told her it would be hard but I would help her find options. 
She wants to let them be indoor outdoor cats to help this :(  I understand why and she has great intentions and loves the cats ; she thinks this would give them a chance to live rather then being rehomed and put down.
I've tried explaining this isn't in the cats best interest.

Vet recommended putting my cats vaccine in back/thigh area instead of neck,"They've always vaccinated my two cats in the neck, but this new vet (it's in the same place I always go, it's a new doctor there) said it was best to give them the shots in the back.

Is my cat all right?,"Guys, I've never had a cat before. I adopted one from a shelter about 3 months ago. My kitten is almost 6 months old. This afternoon I took her to the vet and since we got back she hasn't been normal! She wasn't sick or anything, she was fine, I took her to get the dewormer and just to have a routine check-up. When I got there we saw in the vaccination booklet that she needed a booster of the first vaccine, so the doctor gave it to her and we went home. The thing is, since we got home she's been sulking a lot. As I wasn't here the first time she had the vaccine (my brother was the one who took her) I don't know if this is her normal reaction after the vaccine.

Got forced to adopt a dog,"Disclaimer: this is just me ranting about my situation.  


So my brother decided to rescue a dog off the streets and bring it home. Noble, but he should have just taken it to a shelter. He leaves for work at least 8 hours a day, and me and my parents are left to care for her (she's a female). We have neither the time nor patience to care for her the whole time he's gone, and after about a month of her being here, she has grown attached to us  and it has become increasingly difficult to even think of letting her go at this point. I can't say we haven't grown attached to her either, because we very much have, but sometimes listening to reason is better than listening to emotions. We're having to leave her alone for hours sometimes because we have things to do as well, and it breaks my heart when we hear her howl and cry as soon as I close the door. I don't know squat about training a dog, let alone one with separation anxiety.  I just wish my brother never brought her in the first place.

Edit: To all people offering advice, i truly appreciate it. The good thing is that she doesn't actually damage anything if let alone for a while. I set up a camera the other day to see what she does when we're gone. She just howls and barks a short while (around 15 minutes) and then sits in her usual spot and waits. I think this is good all things considered. ",2024-02-22 06:49:11
sister in law wants to get my niece a doodle for her birthday because of a tv show,"My niece who's 6 is obsessed with the kids tv show ""waffle the wonder dog"". The main character is a red poodle mix (I think?). The kid keeps asking for a waffle dog and my brother and sister in law are actually thinking of giving in and getting her a red cockapoo or labradoodle for her birthday.  
Obviously getting a dog because of a tv show is a bad idea but this kid is only 6 and she will move on to the next fad after a week or two then her parents will be stuck with the dog.  
i've tried telling them this and also telling them that doodles always come from byb or puppy farms but my sister in law doesn't believe me. Her response was ""Just because its a mix doesn't mean everyone who breeds them is bad""  
I'm not really sure how to discourage it. It just angers me when people buy puppies because of movies/tv shows. Is there anything I can say/show them that I haven't already said?",2024-02-22 04:33:13

I don't know what to do with my dog,"A few months ago I rescued an adult dog, but this dog killed my 25-year-old parrot. It was my pet since I was a child and I loved it like a family member. Now I hate the dog and I don't know what to do with it.Sorry, english is not my native language.

Edit  
The dog and the parrot had already lived in the same space before, obviously separated by a bird cage, I never thought that the dog could break the bird cage, all this happened while I was working at home.

"My cat's legs are becoming weaker by the day, I don't think the vet's treatments are working, I want to figure out what's wrong with him.","4 days ago I saw my 7 year old male cat has a slight wobble when walking, even though it wasn't much noticable I took him to the vet that day,  vet told me it's cat flu and gave some shots. But since then his condition became worse and worse, now he can barely stand.

He had this problem before but usally he shows improvement within a single dose, but this time it seems to be only getting worse.

My cat has been given 3 injections over the 4 days, with the second injection given to him 48 hours after the first, the next was given after 24 hours.

My roommates cat is so scared of me,My roommate adopted an adult cat 7 months ago and we knew he was a shy cat. He would run away from all of us and we attributed it to the face he wasn’t used to us. However as time went on he got used to my roommate but still runs away anytime I come near him. Occasionally he will let me pet him when he is laying down and will always eat treats from my hand but otherwise wont let me near him. I thought maybe he wasn’t used to my scent but he loves my room and spends the day in there just on my bed. I adopted a kitten about 3 months ago and maybe thought he would see I am nice but that also did nothing. Is there anything I can do? I feel bad for scaring the shit out of him anytime I come near him. ,2024-02-20 21:43:43

I’m scared to get a cat because I feel like my family will think it’s feminine,"My family is a dog family. Not a single person in my family has owned a cat, let alone a dude. They don’t like cats. My uncle also thinks cats are too feminine, and I already know he’ll be disappointed if he finds out I have a cat. Out of all my uncles, he’s the closest one to me. So I don’t want to disappoint him. There’s a good chance this is all in my head, and he’ll probably just shrug it off if I have a cat and not care much, but I do know that he does not like cats

Also, apart from my family being anti cat, this might be generational. In fact, I used to be anti cat myself. But when I learnt more about them and found out that they’re not just pets who drop furballs and cause trouble, I realized that I’d actully prefer a cat over a dog due to my personality. Dogs are a lot more emotional, but a cat is pretty chill and just vibes how it wants. It’s also pretty independent, just like I am. It doesn’t show emotions as outwardly or strongly as a dog, which is similar to me since Im not emotional

However, my family don’t actually know anything about cats. And they never actually properly raised one. So I’m scared to get a cat because I don’t want to disappoint snyone or get criticized for it. Im a pretty masculine dude myself, and I workout and play sports, but I don’t want to seem feminine to them. Since a dog is a lot more masculine. I’m 17, and I’m going to get a cat probably at 20.

Edit: They probably won’t think I’m a disappointment or something, and will probably just accept it and shrug it off, but as I said earlier, they don’t really like cats

Edit2: I asked my mom and she said she’s totally fine with it! I think everyone else wouldn’t mind either. I guess this was just all in my head ",2024-02-19 11:20:04
How do you get cats to swallow pills?,"I am very experienced with cats, but I'm at my end. So far I have tried:

* Pill syringe thing
* Crushing up pill in her favourite wet food
* Crushing up pill and then syringing it as liquid

I used to be a cat foster, this is not my first rodeo. The effort this fucking baby is putting into spitting out her antibiotics is giving me grey hairs. Does anyone have another suggestion, something I am missing? Every time she wastes another dose it's like $10 down the drain (plus of course, she needs her antibiotics!).

EDIT: Thank you so, so much everyone who commented! After a few more failed attempts, the winning combination was lubing the pills with butter, pill-syringing them, and immediately following with a syringe of water to make her swallow. I also think she just needed some time to feel less awful after a fairly traumatic vet visit. Here's to happy cats! ",2024-02-19 09:10:18

Chewy.com returns – shocked by the love people have for them!,"I can appreciate that they are empathetic about pets passing, and birthdays, but their return \*process\* is designed to be difficult.

Nearly every other e-commerce retailer makes it easy: find your order, select items to return, receive shipping label. Takes 60 seconds.

Chewy, on the other hand, makes you email a generic customer service account. I said I wanted to return XYZ items from this order #. I get another paragraph-long email back from Chewy, asking if I can be more specific. They want me to go into [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com), copy and paste all the individual names and then send it back in a different email client, just to start a return.

Glad people like them as a platform, but for a company that prides itself on ""customer service,"" this is really user-hostile. It shouldn't be this hard. I should be able to return items without involving customer service reps, multiple emails and me doing all the work. ",2024-02-19 02:17:36
My cat has been waking me up when my blood sugar is low,"I  have nondiabetic hypoglycemia. Normally I keep it managed well, but sometimes it drops while I'm sleeping. The first few times my cat woke me up sniffing my mouth and licking my nose when my blood sugar was low, I just thought it a coincidence, but it seems now that is the only time he does it at all. My blood sugar is low every time he seems to do it.  Today when he woke me up it was 64.

I've had cats and hypoglycemia my entire life, but he's the first one to repeatedly persistently wake me up when he apparently notices. He doesn't stop either, he keeps coming back even when I try to go back to asleep, roll over or ignore him. When I just try to cuddle him and go back to sleep, he gets out of my arms and comes back and licks my nose again anyways. Normally, he wants to just be cuddled and forces his head under my arms, so that is unusual as well.

It's interesting though that some pets just do these things naturally on their own.

My husband already feeds him when he gets up, so it's not like he is hungry or anything either.",2024-02-18 05:19:23
My bird is always hugging a rock in her cage. Is this normal?,"My conure is usually really loud and likes to move around her cage a lot. Recently we’ve given her cage a cleaning since she’s always dropping food everywhere. We keep news paper on the platform under her cage and kept a rock there as a paper weight. She likes wandering around the platform a lot so at first it was seemed normal but now she’s become really possessive of the rock. She’s also become a lot more quiet now as well. She’ll lay down on the rock and hug it for a long time while closing her eyes and chirping at it. She’ll just sit on it sometimes and still chirp and flap her wings a bit. She’ll even poke it with her beak at times. She’s also started sleeping there too. She’ll only go up to the actual cage if she’s hungry, needs water, or is taking a bath. Even then she’ll be reluctant to go up sometimes and search for food that she’s dropped onto the platform. I’m a little scared since she’s not acting like her usual self. Sometimes she’ll be ok with me petting her and other times she’ll try to attack me probably because she’s protective of the rock. Does anyone know why she’s acting like this?

Edit: I’ve moved it and she seems to be okay I guess though now that the paperweight is gone she’s went back to throwing the newspaper on the floor unfortunately this is one of her favorite activites lol hopefully she’ll be fine in the next few days!",2024-02-18 02:20:25
Should I consider putting my cat down?,"My cat got diagnosed with Kidney, Gallbladder & Pancreas disease about a week ago. They told me he’s hopeful and due to it being early, they don’t think it’s his time to be put down. My cat is also 13 years old, and the fact he has this so young hurts me.

We had 1 really good day together on appetite stimulus where I had to be insisting but he did eat half a tin of wet food, which isn’t as much as he use to have, but it was the most he had since diagnosed. 

He’s on a ton of meds, and they have me giving him personal IV’s at home and helping him flush his toxins. These usually make him a little more himself and perky, but today it didn’t. He use to at the very least eat treats from my hand, but now his ears perk up but he has no interest. Today for the first time I caught him hiding, he’s even hiding inside his cat carrier which isn’t too strange for him, but he refuses to leave it. 

He had a ton of diarrhoea today (no blood) and they think it’s more to do with the fact of the lack of eating and having so much fluids and what not put into him. 

I’m just stuck on the “he’s hopeful and it’s not time” because I don’t want to believe it’s time, he’s too young still. But I only got 1 day of what looked like improvement and nothing since. 

I’m running out of options.. I tried everything they recommended. I feel so hopeless for this cat and I’m just watching him in pain and essentially starving himself to death before his diagnosis kills him. 

I just don’t want to jump into putting him down if there’s a chance he will still lift up. I’d beat myself up so badly if I do it too early... and I’m currently beating myself up because I want to see improvement and I am met with slim to none

EDIT: 
Thank you to those that have commented. I’m just so worried about him. My vet, and my work have been in the loop and supportive the whole way through. I am going to keep pushing my little guy to do the best he can for a bit longer in hopes all of his treatments have had a fair opportunity to help him out, and hope to see an incline of any kind. I’m really rooting for the best outcome for him. I really appreciate all the empathy, support, and advice everyone has offered me. I love this cat so much, even considering saying goodbye hurts. But it also hurts to think how much pain he’s in and how little to no progress is made, how starving he must be, how different his personality is now. I’d really like to thank you all for being there for me, and my little guy. Really hoping for the best possible outcome",2024-02-17 13:39:52

Dog wont stop bleeding from private area,"This problem started last week Tuesday, almost 2 weeks now and he’s been bleeding from his private area.

Just to clear the confusion, he was bleeding from his Penis but thankfully its now been 2 days since it has fully stopped.

(only 2 pets allowed when signing) Our landlord found out we have a third cat. What to do now?,"Hey everyone,

So our landlord found out we have a third cat. Technically only two are allowed(when we signed the lease). We picked up this stray abandoned kitten after moving into this place. Our other cats are ESA certified.

They sent us a template letter: ""Second pet notice"" wherein they ask us to come to the office and make payment arrangements for the additional pet. But I'm sure they know we already have 2 cats. So I'm not sure if they just don't have a: ""we noticed you have too many pets template"" or are really willing to talk. Either way it's freaking us out.

A lawyer advised us not to tell them we adopted the cat since that's grounds for eviction. So we think we'll tell them it's mom's cat that we're taking care of temporarily. Something like: mom has been having some health issues and wasn't able to take care of it for some time. And that there is a chance she won't be able to take the cat back. And opening up the conversation from there to see what arrangements can be made.

They have a clause in the lease agreement where you can pay for an extra pet which is $100 fee upfront and an additional $10 per DAY! That'd be almost $4000 / year for a cat... And we don't have that money.

We recently have been through some financial hardship too and I hope they're willing to allow us to have this third cat if we agree to pay pet rent and deposit for this cat?  
Or if that doesn't work - What if we pay deposit and rent for all three cats? (even though the other 2 are ESA) It's still pricey af.

The pet fee per pet is $400 and $25/ month rent. HOLY WHAT!? I just checked their website and they updated the maximum pets allowed to three!??!?! I swear we couldn't find a single decent apartment complex around here that allowed more than 2. Did we just jump to a different reality? What the...

So scratch most of that, or not? Since we signed the lease with the two pet limit?... But I guess this would be way easier to negotiate to just pay the fee and pet rent for the third cat, right?

Alright this issue is already a lot lighter than when I started writing this post after finding out about their updated policy. But does that apply to us since we signed under the two pet limit? Either way I'd still highly appreciate any helpful thoughts or advice on this matter.

Thank you!",2024-02-16 11:06:19

rescued baby bird won't eat,"I found a baby bird about 3 weeks ago, took it in and have been feeding it for about 3 weeks, but it is now big and strong enough to eat on its own.

I have been feeding it with tweezers soggy puppy food as recommended.

But, now it is big enough to eat on its own, but won't.

So far I have been putting a small lid filled with soggy puppy food then tapping the tweezers on it so it pecks at it and eats, but the moment I remove the tweezers, it stops eating looking for the tweezers.

Will it eventually just figure it out? I am not sure where to go from here, do I just be patient and keep tapping the lid until it figures it out, or do I just stop doing it until it figures it out?

Not sure how to get it to stop relying on me for food. 

Also, it is deformed, the legs grew in sideways, so it can't walk, and instead hops around on its knees, often falling over, it is slow and can't scratch around for food so just letting it go free to figure it out isn't really an option.

Thanks for the tips!",2024-02-15 20:18:10

Our roommates let our cats outside and now one is missing.,"Me & another roommate live in Minneapolis, MN with 3 other roommates. I have a dog and a cat, and she has one cat. All are extremely well-behaved. We both left town for the weekend for different occasions and the 3 roommates at home agreed to watch the pets between the 3 of them. We came back yesterday (Monday) to find that my roommate’s cat was missing, but my cat and dog were in the house. No one who was in the house could confirm that they saw him recently (he does hide occasionally) and we tore the house apart looking - he’s not here. After finally interrogating one of the roommates that made a snide comment about the situation (“it’s no skin off my teeth if he doesn’t come back”), we found out that the 3 roommates KNEW he had been missing since at least Saturday night. 

Here’s the thing - our front door MUST be locked to stay shut. Even if there is 0 wind and you pull it as tightly as possible, it can open on its own. The 3 roommates are notorious for not locking that door after they open it when leaving. We have reminded them on several occasions to lock the door so the pets don’t get out, no person or animal could just walk into our house, and save the very expensive heat from escaping (also - it’s the front door of your house, pets or not, just lock it when you leave!!). Apparently, one of the 3 found my cat outside and saw the door open, so he brought him inside and texted ONLY the three of them (excluded us) that the door needs to be locked and that my cat was outside. No one ever confirmed they saw the other cat, nor did they notify us. This happened on Saturday night and we did not know anyone was missing until Monday afternoon when we arrived home from our trips and noticed he wasn’t inside. None of them have offered to help or even spoken to us because we now know that they knew, didn’t say anything to either of us, and didn’t go look for him for a full 24 hours. Blatantly lying to our faces, basically. 

We’re still searching and have done everything we know to do. We have cameras out and a neighbor spotted him on her camera, but nothing since then. 

My question is - is there anything we can do legally against the roommates? We’re just really hurt honestly but if anything happens to the missing cat or had happened to my cat/dog, we want to hold them responsible. We also have screenshots that prove they knew he was gone and did nothing about it and also have no intention of locking the door in the future.

UPDATE: (2/14)

Still no sign of the sweet boy. He was last spotted Monday morning around 9:30am on a camera that belongs to a neighbor just a few houses down who does TNR. He hasn’t been spotted since, and it is currently snowing and expected to continue through the night.

The roommates responsible have still not apologized or offered to help and are actively hiding from us.

Send good vibes that he comes home tonight 🤞🏼🙏🏻",2024-02-14 01:00:41

"Neighbor asked me to watch his dog for a few hours, neighbor has now been in ICU for a month.","A month ago a neighbor called and texted my wife and I early on a Saturday morning. It seemed urgent so I called him back. He said he was not feeling well and asked if we could watch his dog for a few hours. His body started shutting down and he has been intubated and sedated the entire time. He had one day where the removed the tube and let him use his phone. He called my wife but nothing he was saying made any sense and he was not able to discuss the dog. The neighbor does not have any family other than a sister on the other side of the country that he is not very close to and he does not have many friends that care about him all that much. We have had this dog for a month now with no guidance from the owner about what to do. The sister sent us a bag of food and treats, so that was nice. We also have two of our own dogs. They are becoming attached to this dog as am I and my wife but we are in agreement that this dog will not fit into our lifestyle. Our dogs are <25lbs and do not shed, this dog is 70lbs and sheds like crazy. Since this is not our dog we are constantly stressed about him, what if he gets sick or hurt, we don't know anything about his medical history but he takes seizure meds (we got his prescription), and to be honest we really just don't have the space for this size of dog.

All said, we are not seeing any valid options, we can't give him away (to a person we trust) and we would never take him to the shelter. We don't want to pay for the dog to board and the owner is broke.",2024-02-13 03:38:52
"How do I take care if an adult, disabled, wild AF murderer of a lovebird that I cant release bc it cant fly or walk??","Hello. A few weeks ago a bird somehow stumbled into my mom’s house. I say stumbled because he cannot fly or walk. He has flayed legs that a vet told me was a birth defect so he cannot walk and idk why he cant or refuses to fly. He also had one eye completely swollen shut but that seems to be getting better, and he was covered in ants. Someone else took him in but decided they cannot keep him and my mom hates pets so she is releasing it to the wild which I think is obviously a bad idea. 

So now I, with no previous experience of ever having a bird for a prolonged period, have decided to take him in. I live in an apartment and my roommate doesn’t even like birds but I convinced her because I think if I let him go he might die?? 

So anyway, I need tips. How do I take care of this little spider legged bird that bites everyone and hates humans?  
He is an adult and far from tame but I would love it if I could tame him so that its easier for both of us. How do I do that? 
What do I feed him? I want to give him healthy food. 
What kinda toys would he like? 
I can only let him out for a limited period so obviously I am getting a bigger cage but how big should it be? And is that ok, to let him out like once a day? 
And most importantly, what do I name him? (Or is it a her?) 
Help a girl out pls


Update: 

I just wanted to clear some stuff out. 

1. My mother is not cruel. Far from it. She is terrified of birds and yet when she found him in her garden she took him to the visiting vet, got him the medication, and found him a home. 

2. The new owner wants us to take the bird back. Usually where I live when a pet bird like a love bird is unwanted they are released to this specific park. There are a lot of birds there now. So my mom thought that would be the best option since nobody wants him and she is terrified of him. She thinks thats whats best for him. She knows its not now. 

3. I live in the Maldives. These birds were not originally native to where I live but there is a lot of them now. The temperature is hot. We have a tropical weather. 

4. We dont have a 24/7 vet. Just a visiting one. We have a veterinary clinic but I dont believe they euthanize animals there. I will check. But I dont think I will go through with it if he is not in pain.

5. No sanctuary anywhere near me. 

6. I have exhausted all my options and I think right now if he is not in constant pain I am his best option and a good life. And I wanna give him that. 

7. He was never a wild bird. He is a discarded pet. :( 

8. I have the funds just not the resources or knowledge. 

9. His eye is healed now. He is already looking much healthier. He just cant walk on a flat surface or fly properly.

Boyfriend brought his cat with feline leukemia,So his cat moved in like 8 months after my cat was already here because she was in a different state for a while. She was here a few months before his mom told me she had feline leukemia when we went to visit. I for a while just thought that meant his cat was sick with cancer but it took me a couple months to look it up because she was getting really sick and I wanted to see if there’s any medications to help her. Turns out it’s very contagious between cats. My cat and his cat have been sharing litter boxes and water bowls since his moved in. I just wish he told me it was contagious. Should I be worried about my baby?,2024-02-12 06:02:42
Chewy 10/10 returns,"Y’all I accidentally ordered the wrong food and I am so impressed by their return policy. This is not an advertisement I am just in awe of the morals of this company. Instead of asking for a return they are asking me to donate it to a local rescue. That is AMAZING! I wish all companies had this structure for returns. Anyone else have a similar experience?

Edit: I saw online that their employees are not treated very well? Anyone know anything about this? ",2024-02-12 03:35:29
"My cousin's cat went to the vet, blood tests were normal. After neutering him, putting a drainage on him and returning after 3 days to take the drainage out, his test results are now life threatening bad. Did they mess up the surgery?","My cousin had been taking care of a stray cat for about 6 months. About a week ago he had gotten into an alteracation with another cat and he was wounded. His wound healed up, but she noticed he had been losing weight and the paw where he was wounded had swelled, so we decided to take him to the vet. First day we came in, on tuesday, his results all came back negative and nothing was worrying (according to the vet).  

However, she suggested to put a drainage on his paw so that the wound could be disinfected. And she also offered to have him neutered as well. My cousin said okay and so they did. Apparently, he was being hostile and refused to be sedated, so they ended up using anesthesia. They sent him home with pain medicine and said everything would be fine  and to come back in 3 days to take the drainage out. My cousin was very dilligient that he got his medicine and ate. Only on thursday she said that he was having problems eating but otherwise he seemed like he had been eating.

Fast forward to yesterday, this friday, and apparently his ALT is through the roof and he might die now. They say that he *might* have Hepatic Lipidosis and that his liver is failing. My question is why didnt they notice this on tuesday and why in the heck did they suggest we neutered him if he could have possibly been at risk? It's so suspicious that his blood work was fine on tuesday, and then 3 days post the surgery they did, it came back riddled with problems. Now they're saying to consider euthanization and that they're not responsible if he dies because we are unwillingly to keep him hospitalized even though the hospitalization has only been making him worse. Now his ALT (GPT) is 3,000 AFTER they took care of him today. Is it possible that they messed something up and that they're not taking accountability for it? Or was it just coincidence that after surgery his test results were bad? Was this just unfortunate timing? Was it dangerous and malpractice to suggest we have him neutered? Because they're saying it was because he wasn't eating that this happened (keep in mind that his test results were completely fine on tuesday and only got bad on friday). 

His ALT (GPT) was 82 on tuesday on Friday it was over 1,000

Edit: Medication sent home: Robenacoxib Feline 3pk -6 and Gabapentin -100mg

Edit 02/11: Okay, I understand now that it was a flurry of things that could have happened and it's not necessarily the vet's fault. However, he's at home with my cousin home now and she's taking care of him. He is still slive and he's eating better and he seems much more active there than in the vet. She says if he passes, she'll know she did everything she could. He has an appointment on the 20th to remove his stitches from his surgery with the same clinic. So we'll just wait and see what happens until then, if he passes before then or they say he's suffering too much, she'll most likely put him down. This is really unfortunate, and she wishes she can turn back time to take him to the vet when he first got into that fight, alas it's impossible now. 

He's a strong cat, when she first started helping him out him 6 months ago, he was really skinny that you could see his bones. So she's hoping that fighter spirit will help him through this now as it did back to that time when he was a stray. I'll update if any there is any new developments. Thank you for all the advice and insight.",2024-02-11 12:06:32
how to convince dad to allow dog on carpet?,"so my dog is a 2 year old maltipoo and she is FULLY house trained and obviously hardly sheds. my dad refuses to let her upstairs because it’s carpeted and only allows her to live downstairs where it’s all tile.. i just don’t understand why she can’t be on carpet if she is clean, doesn’t drop hair, and is fully potty trained.. he says it’s because he doesn’t even like dogs in the house at all and because she can have an accident at any time. any tips to convince my dad to allow her upstairs? she hasn’t had any accidents for a long time.",2024-02-11 09:37:42
Not Sure What To Do,"I've been a long time lurker or Reddit but still unsure how any of it works or if I'm doing any of this right. My road somehow turned into a dumping place for animals, especially cats. They find their way to me and I've always cared for any that showed up. I recently had some major financial issues and the few cats I have not been able to adopt out need supplies. I do work, and this is mostly a one time need because I'm digging back out of my hole. (My partner had a car accident which is how we are here) I'm currently trying to figure out my own food situation but honestly, my fur babies are more important than me right now. Currently, I have 3 indoor cats but one is a stray that I brought in recently because she literally just gave birth. There are 3 outside cats as well. I'm not hording them and work with my local SPCA to adopt them out, spay/neuter them, etc. They just can't take them all at once. I'm sorry if I did this wrong and I will delete it if I violated anything I missed. I checked around, my local pet food bank isn't available as they are out of donations (It was the first time I ever tried to use them) and I found a place on here but since I've never posted or commented, it seems my karma is too low to post. Any ideas are welcome and truly appreciated. I hate asking for help but I would do anything for animals.",2024-02-11 02:35:08
Is my friend mistreating his dogs? What would you do about it if you were in my situation?,"My friend lives round the corner from me and I go to his often so I see the dogs a lot. My heart breaks for the every time I see them.

**About the dogs:**\- Both are scruffy and always smell bad.- One of them is extremely skinny.- I go round his house often and never see any water left out. I personally have to fill bowls for them when he has gone into another room and they all rush to it and get through the whole bowl in seconds.- I've seen him hit one of the dogs on a couple of occasions.- He uses shock collars on one of the dogs and a prong collar on the other one. He keeps the prong collar on the dog 24/7.- Last year he made his dogs sleep outside all winter on the concrete. (I am in the UK and it gets to below freezing here). At other times I have seen the dogs sleep in a smelly toilet cubicle. One time he told me tied his dog to the wall with a rope during winter for nights on end.- He rarely walks the dogs, perhaps once every few days.

I am very concerned as recently they have adopted another dog that has already been abused in its time and I'm worried it'll suffer the same fate again...

I feel so conflicted about what to do. I don't think he should be allowed to keep animals but I feel it's not my place to say anything. Has anybody made an anonymous report to an animal organisation? I feel like that is an option perhaps... What can I do to help out these poor dogs?

TIA

**UPDATE:** I have reported all the issues to the RSPCA this morning. If they decide to take them I will do what I can to make sure the dogs go to somewhere more caring and loving. Thank you for all your guidance. I will provide another update as soon as I know what's happening with the dogs. ",2024-02-10 23:04:28
I’ve never put down a pet nor woken to a pet death,"I’ve had pets all my life. And my family had put down 2 dogs. My 17 year child hood lab and my mom’s dog who was about 10 years old. 

I have a dog who is around 16-22 years old. I’ve had him since I was 11. He’s not sick or uncomfortable so I have time. But I genuinely don’t know what to do. If I wake up to him gone, what am I supposed to do? Also I don’t want to put him down at a vet. But if I do at home what am I supposed to do with his body? 

I can’t bury him I don’t have a yard.

Edit: Thank you all for the suggestions. I’ll bring it up to the vet at his next appointment. 

Just a few clarifications. I’ve had him for 16 years so I can confirm that age but I got him as an adult dog and they told me he was 4-6 years old. He was rescued from a back yard breeder/hoarder and was super skinny, covered in fleas and ticks. So he could have been a 1 year-old dog but was so sick and malnourished they thought he was older.

A friend’s dachshund is staying with me..,"I left for less than two minutes to grab laundry and she peed at the front door and pooped on my bedroom rug. I’m assuming it’s separation anxiety, but the pooping and peeing in these spots is way too intentional and inconveniently always in front of a door entrance, a place when I commonly sit, or 2-3 feet from a pee pad.

As of right now I’m crating her if I have to step out of the house, because I was so wrong for trusting her unsupervised even through we were chilling on the couch the whole morning. 

I told her owner about this, and they said they don’t have these issues with her.

Update: she’s doing better now.
I started putting her in her crate before I left. ",2024-02-10 02:21:49
Planned Adoption Cancelled Last Minute,"Hey there! I don't post a lot on reddit, so I apologize in advance for the the formatting.

I (21M) have been looking for a dog to adopt with my family for some time. My boss at work does a lot of animal rescue work in my college town, and she approached me about a well-mannered golden that a retired couple was trying to find a good home for. The golden was found about 3 weeks ago by the couple in the woods on their property starving, so they took him in and nursed him back to health. They have another dog that doesn't get along with the golden, so they were trying to find a good home for the dog. I inquired further about the dog, and after talking it over with my family we agreed we wanted to adopt him. A little back story that may help here: my sister is going blind due to a genetic syndrome she was born with. Every since she was little, she had a golden retriever stuffed animal that she brought with her everywhere. Due to this, my family decided that we want to get a golden for my sister before she goes blind. That is why we agreed to the adoption so quick. My boss also assured us that the dog was well manner, potty trained, fixed, chipped, and vaccinated. All of these factors led to us agreeing to the adoption of the dog. I had planned to come see the dog, at the current ""owners"" property the next day to meet the dog before I brought him home that next week. Unfortunately, late that same night, the couple the dog was staying with changed their mind and cancelled everything, because they decided that they liked the dog too much and couldn't part ways with him. I'm not mad, as the dog will have a good home, but we are, understandably, a little upset.

Throughout all of this, my boss acted as the third party to speak between my family and the current owners. I'm considering asking my boss to reach out and see if its at all possible for me to speak to them personally. I don't want to convince them to change their minds, as it seems like they are a good home for the dog from what I've been told. I just want to see if they're willing to hear me out, and I want to reassure them that if they change their minds that my family will be a good, welcoming, home for the dog.

&#x200B;

Is it wrong of me to do this? Should I leave it and just forget about it? Keep in mind that finding a golden rescue with all of the above is not easy, and my family seems pretty set on getting a golden for my sister. I understand that this may come off as very selfish, but that's why I'm asking for advice. 

&#x200B;

Thank you for any responses! Happy to answer any questions.",2024-02-09 11:28:16

Why you should adopt older cats too :),"Hi all, i wanted to share a bit about my journey on adopting my cat because im just so full of love rn and i hope to destigmatize this topic as well as ease some minds. 

I started looking for a kitten a couple of years ago and i was ready to adopt one if i ever came across one (on the street or by a friend etc. ive always been againts ""buying"" pets bc no) and for an entire YEAR i searched for one. I usually run into kittens frequently but somehow i just never ever came across one for an entire year, now i know why lol.

I eventually started looking at all the cats i came across on the street instead of just kittens and felt like i entered a whole new dimension. I kept seeing this one fluffy, super dirty, old looking cat in front of a store i usually go to and just couldn't stop thinking about it. When it started snowing a few days later and i went home with a gut wrenching feeling of guilt, i knew i had to take care of her. Next thing in the morning i got her in a carrier and took her to the vet where i found out she was a she, around 5 years old, was spayed and was also missing a few teeth. Turns out there was a lady that took care of the cats around that area and had taken her to the vet a couple of times to get her spayed after she gave birth. They successfully got all of her kittens adopted but no one wanted to adopt her... After shedding a couple of tears and watching her purr endlessly as the vet brushed her, i took her home.

She was suuuper scared, she didn't get out from under the couch for days. She wouldn't eat, wouldn't pee and i was absolutely frantic thinking that she was gonna die and that i had made a mistake. Eventually after some bribing with wet food she started to come out. I had to massage her stomach while she was on the litter box to make her go lol. She wasn't hopping onto couches or beds, she wasn't letting us pet her, she was just constantly anxious but she learned how to use the litter box super quickly. 

After a couple of weeks she discovered my bedroom and would cuddle up on the floor behind my curtains, only leaving her place to eat or to use the litter box. I discovered she loved being brushed not much later and sometimes showed her the brush to lure her out. Brushed her on the couch, the bed, anywhere really to make her feel more comfortable. She was terrified of my sheets and blanket, my guess was someone threw a towel or something on her to catch her once, because whenever i made my bed she would run and hide.

One night i slept on my blanket because it was hot and i woke up in the middle of the night with her on the edge of the bed. This could have been like 3 months after we adopted her. I was so excited i could scream lol. That was the end of it, ever since that day she always slept on my bed with me. It started with her on the very edge and now she is sleeping next to my head.
Eventually she started to claim couches, chairs, the spots in front of some windows. I haven't seen her hide anywhere in over a year now. She turned out to be a super affectionate (literally pet her for hours and she would want more) girl with super loud purrs. She has some quirks sure, like not eating much if im not watching, not letting me touch her stomach or touch her paws (which is completely fine), being a little more drooly than some cats because of her teeth, laying in my bed in such a way that I can't fit in it and absolutely not moving whatever i do... And i love her even more for every single one of these things.

Adopting Venus (my cat) was the best decision i have ever made in my life and i thank the universe every time i look at her for bringing me to her by not showing me any kittens lol. 

Animals are amazing creatures no matter their age. All they ask for is love and they will be your loyal companions for the rest of their lives. Next time you're in a shelter or you see an adult animal in need on the street, think about it :)

PSA from a veterinarian: just give the darn trazodone.,"Hi there - I'm an emergency/urgent care veterinarian, graduated 8 years ago so I've been in the field quite a bit.  I just wanted to share with you a personal experience followed by a strong recommendation.  Read through, it's worth it, I promise.

At age 19, I had wisdom teeth pulled x4.  Three days later, I developed a headache...that never went away (suspected nerve damage but who the heck knows).  I spent the next four years in/out of hospitals, getting spinal taps, MRIs, CT scans, the works.  I had to drop out of college for a semester and lord only knows how I graduated and made it to vet school.  Fast forward many years, I found a great neurologist who has my ""new daily persistent headache"" (which basically means...you've had a headache every day for 15 years but we don't know why) relatively under control on meds with a few flareups.

But needless to say, I developed what I can only describe as PTSD related to the dentist, which honestly is not all that surprising.  I have to egg myself on to get to the dentist (and I have a great one).  I went three weeks ago for a cleaning, got a clean bill of health.  Last week, a back molar started hurting.  Went to the dentist yesterday.  I was anxious going in but am usually able to talk myself down.  I ended up needing to get prepped for a crown.  Everyone was wonderful, and I mean truly wonderful.  But I could feel my anxiety getting worse and worse (barely staving off a panic attack).  I held it together until the end of the appointment, and then four hours later had a complete breakdown.

Why do I bring this up?  Because literally the only thing keeping me in that dentist chair was the semblance of control I had over the situation.  I could tell them to stop at any time, and they would have listened.  And that STILL wasn't enough for me to completely stave off intense feelings of panic and anxiety.

Now picture your dog going to the veterinarian for a routine annual visit and vaccines, he's anxious, we try coaxing him/her to get on board with lots of praise and pets and yummy treats.  But he's not having it.  He's bucking and trying to flee the situation.  He's not giving us great vibes, and our faces need to be near him to get the job done.  While I know your dog probably doesn't act like this is any other situation, I have my face near your dog's mouth of giant, potentially life- or career-ending teeth.  So we may ask to place a muzzle. I often get people offended and dismissive of the very real danger that we put ourselves in to take care of people's pets.  I have had people tell me it is my job to get bitten.  I had a friend mauled so severely by a dog, she needed to be gurneyed out of the hospital and ended up requiring months of rehab and several surgeries.

And then the best statement always comes: ""well, can't you just hold him down and do what you need to do?""

I bring you back to my earlier story of myself at the dentist.  I am a human being and can rationalize that the dental staff is trying to help me and I still ended up in a severe state of panic.  Your dog cannot do the same.  If we recommend stopping what we are doing, it is for your dog's best interest (and selfishly, ours sometimes too as we really don't like wrestling with 120 pound dogs on the floor when our backs are already shot).  If we recommend stopping what we are doing and sending your pet home with trazodone and gabapentin to give before the next visit, we really are not trying to make your life harder.  I am trying to avoid the same sense of panic that I feel going to the dentist in your dog.  I am not trying to inconvenience you.  I know 20 years ago, everyone just ""held 'em down and got 'er done"" but we don't do that anymore, and it's not fair to ask us to do so.  Medicating your dog is for \*your dog's\* benefit so that they don't feel the crushing need to try and escape or defend themselves when we try to draw blood or give them a vaccine.

So that's it, that's my TED talk.  In summary, I ask you as a veterinarian who loves what I do and want to do what's best for everyone (including my staff that are paid a pittance compared to human nurses but do SO much more), including you, and most importantly, your dog.  Just please don't argue with us.  Give the damn trazodone and gabapentin and come back another day.  Your dog (and this veterinarian) will thank you for it.  


ETA: This goes for gabapentin for the kitties as well!  Don't want to leave those guys out.",2024-02-08 01:54:28
My cat roared!,"Ok so this is a weird one for me!  I have had (counts) 11 cats through out my life. All of them perfectly typical in their behaviours. This morning, all was quiet when my 2 yr old void suddenly leapt to her feet, ROARED, and ran growling towards the door of our apartment! I'm talking a deep, from her toes, someone gonna die today roar! She sniffed around a bit, shook her tail, then came back to my chair and went to sleep like nothing happened!

My cat ran away last night.,"I'd follow the regular guidelines but this is such a special case that I really need guidance and also to vent a little I guess because I am so exhausted.

So, we have a strictly indoors cat (we've had her for about 4 years). We always watch out for doors to be closed, she is sterilized and whenever I can't see her for like 3-4 hours, I always start searching for her. 

Last night me or one of my family members forgot to lock the doors properly and the main door opened at night and seems like my cat slipped through it and ran away. Our visitor noticed this at about 3 am and closed the door (never saw the cat anywhere). There was horrible wind outside, as well as serious cold weather, and our cat is very skittish and fearful in general so when I was told this information in the morning I just assumed that she must be somewhere in the house. I searched her in my house hoping that I would find her snuggled up somewhere and in home's vicinity outside as well just in case she really left home. I continued searching, and my mother and father started helping me in the evening as well. At around 8 pm my father found him outside in our sort of like basemanty place and immediately called me and my mom. I was so so happy that I didn't think it through and just rushed there without a plan. Well... She managed to escape and we couldn't catch her, but we saw exactly where she went: a huge pile of building materials, rocks and stuff right at the verge of our yard where the gates are not really well protected or well made : she could simply go through them and leave our land entirely. We carefully searched around this pile but could not exactly locate her, but we are almost sure she is in there.

She's very scared and does not react to us calling her name or food (never really followed the food sounds or her name at home either :/). Scared that we'd further scare her away we retreated at home and it's been like this for around 2 hours now. I feel so helpless, I do not know what to do. I've put out her litter box, some food, and my used sweather so maybe she can find us with the smell once she feels at least a little relaxed, but I'm not sure it's going to work :( she is very careful, shy, and fearful, I am worried she'll never come back and she'll just run away and continue hiding until something happens to her. The fact that I didn't think stuff through and she escaped is making me crazy. The fact that I know approximately where she is but can't do anything is making me crazy. Is there anything else I can do right now? It's very cold, windy, and rainy outside now, further scaring her into hiding :( Thankfully, it's getting warmer and sunnier from tomorrow but I am afraid it'll be too late by then.

UPDATE: I found her! I went out at 5 am gently calling for her and I found her close to our basement, sitting on a small bench. I approached her very slowly and she immediately let me pet her. I grabbed her and took her inside. I was sure it was her but I also woke my mom up to be even more sure because I distrust when good things happen lol, she confirmed it's indeed her. Now she's just sniffing everything and demanding a lot of cuddles. She doesn't have any injuries, just had one small spiky plant stuck to her belly. I hope at least from now on she won't ever want to go outside but she doesn't seem particularly scared, just happy to be home. ",2024-02-07 02:41:15
"Neighbor's cat got out (again), we found her but they won't take her back","Hey all, just looking for a little advice I guess. One of our neighbor's has (or I guess had) a cat that got out a few times over the time that we've been living in our current residence (almost a year now). Each time, we were able to safely retrieve her and return her, but today after my partner was able to recapture her yet again, he tried to return her only to get told that they ""wouldn't let that cat back in the house"". We had also overheard one of her owners on the phone say that he wanted to get rid of her the first time she went missing because he just happened to walk by our window as he was saying it. We think it's safe to say that they aren't going to be asking for this cat back at this point.

We already have a cat of our own (very displeased by all of this), and can't have a second one under our current lease. I'm thinking it would probably be best to bring her to the closest shelter (no kill, appears to have very good reviews as well), but would we be able to hand her over to them? Would there be a cost to do so despite her technically not being ours? Money is pretty tight for us, and I hope that this wouldn't be a huge issue if we were to bring her in. For some context, we live in Portland OR.

She's an incredibly sweet cat, couldn't be more than a couple of years old. I want to make sure we are able to do right by her after the rough time she had with her previous owners. Any advice or info is appreciated!",2024-02-06 12:04:14

I have to euthanize my little budgie today and it's absolutely destroying my heart,"update: turns out he had cancer going to get him cremated, thank you so much for your comments I've read all of them 💕

He's never had a good life, when I first went in to buy a budgie from the pet shop I had one in mind, an energetic colourful female bird

but when I saw all the other birds socialising and he was left all alone on the other perch I instantly grew attached to him. I know it's probably wrong but I felt so sorry for him, I thought that no way would anyone else ever pick  him and due to how he looked so I bought him and named him apricot

he has PTSD or trauma from whatever breeder  he came from and he's never liked humans, he's always been scared of them and he certainly never liked me. he can't fly, he stays in his cage 24/7 despite me trying to encourage him to at least eat from my hand. but he never has

it's all been 100% unconditional love and I love him so so much, I see myself in him. he's been through a lot and I've always saw him as my hope, my little bird. I thought that I could help enrich his life make him happy, but he's never been a happy bird and I feel disgusted with myself

he has a companion called nugget and nugget lost his friend Charlie a few weeks before I bought apricot

Apricot has had a lot of problems one main one being his feather cysts. one started on his wing. I thought it was a tumor at first so I asked the pet shop person later and said it's 100% fatal. his time will end soon when it pops

he''s never been to an avian vet but just a regular vet. my family is poor and my mum and family  dont care about his health. the thought is ""get another one once he passes"" 

he now has 6 feather cysts. 1 popped on one wing, 2 on the other, 1 big one and 2 little ones near his bum and where his tail meets

I could have 110% prevented it and I know I could have and because of my negligence I need to take a life today

he's eating, sleeping, preening himself, drinking but the infection has gotten so bad that its beyond too late now, he's in so much pain and I can see it

this whole situation has opened my eyes immensely. if I can't afford the healthcare then  ill never own another pet. I genuinely think that buying yourself a pet and having zero money for healthcare is just absolutely cruel

it hurts so much because he's completely fine but just in a whole lot of pain, those cysts are going to keep coming back for his entire life and I can't afford to help him.

I remember when he first opened up to me, is when I had to grab him to put him in a little cage to take him to the vet. I then had to give him his medicine to help with the pain and some with some antibiotics and ever since then I broke a barrier because he doesn't pull away when I pet him anymore

although he doesn't eat from my hand Im incredibly happy that he finally saw me not as a threat after having him for over 2 years

the worst part about putting him down is that he has absolutely no clue what's happening or what's coming and it's tearing me apart

my little budgie, my hope my everything in a few hours will be gone. how can I even study  to be a veterinarian when I can't even save his life

the guilt is tearing me apart. now I need to look him in the eyes while he'll probably be stressed and scared while knowing fine well that all of this could have been avoided if I already had money prepared for a scenario like this

i can't vent to my family because they don't get it, I can't vent to my friends because they don't get it. I just need to sit and endure what's going to happen in a few hours. I just cannot sleep all I can do is keep spoiling him until it's time to go",2024-02-05 14:33:26
How do I break the bond with my kitten?,"He's literally my best friend and such a good lad. He's  9 months old (had him since 8 weeks old) and we have a great connection. He always sleeps in my bed at night purring and curled up in my arms after kneading me for half an hour, loves to cuddle and get belly rubs, play fetch, and he follows me around the house like we're attached at the hip.

But that's where the problems arise. I spend a lot of time with him, but I also have other commitments in life. If I shut him in one room and go into another, he meows and cries constantly at the door. While I'm at work, I have my mum come by to check on him, but they don't have much of a bond. She loves him and tries hard but the kitten doesn't hide the fact he doesn't like her much and avoids her the whole time she is there. She says he mainly has the zoomies the whole time and won't let her pet him. If I leave him alone, I can hear him crying all the way down the driveway and when I get back he's clawed the wallpaper and chairs. And when I take him out on the harness, he hisses at anybody who walks too close to me in protection. I love that we are so bonded but it's a bit of a worry that he's only ever settled when I'm around.

I want him to get along with my mum more, especially as I go on a weeks holiday in June and my mum is staying to look after him while I'm away. I'm concerned of how he will be. I don't want to break the bond we share fully but I need him to be a bit more open with other people and not so reliant on me. Has anyone got any other suggestions?",2024-02-05 08:05:07

My senior dog just had her first seizure.,"My anxiety is thru the roof and I'm exhausted as this happened in the middle of the night around 3am today. I was awoken by things being knocked over in our room and found her shaking uncontrollably, stiff, and foaming at the mouth. This was the most terrifying thing I've ever witnessed to be honest, the feeling of your heart sinking from helplessness is unreal and unforgiving. The seizure lasted (what I believe) was 2 mins. It could have been shorter but it could have been longer. I layed with her trying to comfort her while she went through it. Once she stopped, she was very out of it, disoriented and scared. She didn't want to go outside, drink, anything. Managed to get her into the car and off to the ER we went. She got blood work done and it came back fine, we're gonna get an X-ray on Monday with her primary vet bc it'll be cheaper. We're back at home now and she's resting next to me but I am TERRIFIED AND ON EDGE about it happening again soon. This was her first seizure ever, coincidentally the night of her 13th birthday. What do I expect in the next hours coming, days even. I won't sleep for days now 😣

EDIT #1: I'm editing this now bc I have a not so great feeling we're gonna get another one tonight. Just to let everyone know, I am still very much terrified and on edge. I've cried a lot today, again, witnessing that was unbelievable and unbearable. I think I've felt nauseous all day. But we've gone all day since 4am without anything else but I'm still worried and scared. And I'd like to just thank everyone again for their kind words. I'm just a mess right now. Thank you 

EDIT #2: UPDATE: 2/5/24
She had another seizure today. Lasted about 2mins. I took a video but I cannot watch it for my life or I will cry until I'm sick. We took her to the closest vet since they're open and we've gotten some seizure meds and a emergency med, too. They think she may have lost her vision, although it could be temporary as a post-seizure symptom but, she's unreactive to things close to her eyes. So, we have to look out for too. When I say this has been the WORST 48hrs of my life, I am 100% sure it is. I'm lost, folks. I've slept 4hrs and that was early this morning as she made it thru the night no problem. I'm mentally, emotionally, and physically drained and I'm going thru it and idk what I'm gonna do if I lose her. Wow this is hard",2024-02-04 20:25:11
Why is my dog suddenly a bully?,"So i have a 3 year old border collie. I used to take my dog to the dog park every weekend since he was a pup and he loved it. People always commented on how gentle and affectionate he was with other dogs.

Then on the day of his 2nd birthday it started. He started attacking other dogs. Not all dogs but enough that taking him to the dog park was no longer an option.

I noticed it was German shepherd's and husky dogs he really did not like, also dogs with a bulldog like face at first but, since then it seems to be almost any dog he hates. Even dogs he used to play with regularly.

The worst event is when he freed himself from his collar because he saw a dog half a field away and ran over to attack it. I pulled him off the dog but not before receiving a nasty bite requiring several stitches. Naturally he is on a harness now so that won't be happening again.

He spends pretty much everyday with me so I'm fairly certain there was no trauma or abuse that started this and he is neutered also. Looking to get my fella back on track but cannot afford a trainer. Any thoughts or suggestions welcome.",2024-02-04 04:05:10

Had to re-home my cats,"Hi... I'm very emotional about this, but, yeah - I found a new, loving home for my cats. I'd adopted them February last year, when my life seemed very stable and it looked like I'd be able to stay with them forever. But late last year, things changed; my mom had a stroke in August and I want her to spend more time over at my place, because we've been very close and she's been needing support more than ever. 

Thing is, she's extremely allergic to cats, and gets a headache just from walking into my place and smelling them. The urine is even worse, so she'd been avoiding visiting me because, well, it was bad for her. However, I'd been holding on and visiting her place more often, rather than having her come to mine, which was working fine.

But now, my company wants me to move abroad... so not only do I get less time to spend with my mum, but I also would have to be away from my cats for 3, maybe 6 months. And the only person that could care for them, for that long, and lives near me, is my mum.

So, seeing as they're either going to have to spend half a year alone, with barely any company as my mum can't really pet and play with them even if she did become their caretaker, or find a new family and be loved every day like I've done for the past year, I opted for the latter.

I'm afraid they won't care for them as well as I did, but I know it's in my head, since we've met, they already have a really nice cat and so on. I know they'll be loved and cared for, it just feels wrong even though I know I did the right thing.

Anyway... that's all. I wanted to rationalize what I'm feeling. Sorry for the wall of text.",2024-02-04 03:12:17
Honest question... Why do we demonize people who want to get rid of their pets?,"We don't understand everybody's situation. Many times, assumptions are made to the situation. The owner is made to be incompetent, lazy, a pos, and everything else under the Sun that makes them look bad just because they want to give their pet to another home.

I get it, pets are supposed to be family. Then again, so are spouses. People get divorces all the time and sometimes it's encouraged even. At the end of the day, nobody puts up a big deal about a divorce like they do when somebody wants to give their pet away. 

So the question ultimately is why do we think that our opinions about somebody given their pets away are any better than the reasons why they want to give the pet away?",2024-02-04 02:05:29
Unsure if I should put my dog down,"I’m pretty set on my decision to proceed with euthanasia, but I’m feeling tremendous amounts of guilt and waves of uncertainty / lack of confidence in my choice.

My dog, 13-year Lhasa Apso / Shih Tzu mix, was taken to the emergency vet on Tuesday night. When I had gotten home from work, he was doing tight circles until he was dizzy and falling down. Not only that, he suddenly would not walk on his leash, was crashing into everything headfirst, would not come to me, and seemed incredibly lost and confused.

The vet kept him overnight and it was discovered he had a spike in his blood pressure that caused the retina in his right eye to detach, and the eye to fill with blood. His blood pressure was 180 and the vet said 100 is normal. At some point during the night it spiked to 205. His other eye was non responsive as well, but not bloody… he has experienced 100% sudden blindness. Among other tests, it was discovered he has no platelets left in his blood. The emergency vet suggested I take him to his regular vet to do further analysis on what is causing that. 

We went to his vet yesterday and she said that she felt no masses in his body (my guy is 10 lbs and very skinny) and that there is a possibility of bone marrow cancer but she didn’t feel his weight and size would hold up against the sedatives and steroids needed to test for that, so she strongly encouraged me to not do it. I took Barney home.

He has been sleeping 80% of the day, having accidents in the house (it seems like he doesn’t know he needs to go until he’s actively going), he doesn’t come by me much now where he was always my shadow, he hasn’t wagged his tail, barked, played or anything since Monday. He’s still eating when I feed him and he’s drinking a ton of water he just can’t find his bowls so i bring them to him. Every time I pick him up he wants down and he would rather sleep on the floor than in the bed with me which he always would do before. 

I feel like I’m making a guess based on very little information, but at the end of the day something is causing the platelets and blood pressure issue but I won’t ever know what. Is it best to put him down peacefully before this has a chance to get worse? Should I monitor him everyday instead?

I’m not ready to let him go but I never want to see my baby suffer, and whatever is happening to him seems to be moving so quickly. It’s hard as I’ve only had him 1.5 years, so I feel like I didn’t have enough time with him, but that was a risk when I decided to adopt a senior dog. 

I just want to make sure I’m making the best decision and I’ve been wrestling with this since yesterday. The vet implied that I should put him down, I just had to take him home and spend the weekend with him. I’m just so unsure. 

It also important to note that I do go to the office three times a week so I can’t always be with him. I’m going to always be incredibly worried that something happened while I’m working. It’s a hard feeling.

How do you deal with cruelty?,"So I was scrolling on Instagram yesterday , basically watching funny pet videos and came across some guy who was filming a cat trying to hide from a dog. 
This poor cat had a look of absolute terror on its face meowing at the guy and he just kept filming as the dog grabbed the cat and mauled it. 

He filmed it. And was laughing saying ‘ no mercy for the p*ssy’ 

I had to cut the video when the dog let the cat go and the cat was laying on its side while the dog still was sniffing it , cat was clearly hurt badly and bleeding a lot. 

I *know* people are cruel. I *know* dogs have instincts. I reported the post and the account and blocked them , but I can’t get over it .

My heart hurts so badly , there’s nothing I can do about it . I keep thinking about it . I keep seeing that cats face as he looked at the guy. 

How do handle this ? How do you look at your own pet and think that there’s people who would willingly hurt and torture them for their own entertainment? 

It’s not right. It’s not fair.",2024-02-03 09:30:52
Heart worm test came back positive for my dog,"Took our dog to the vet for normal check up and yearly shots. Everything was completely normal until we got a call earlier today from our vet saying our dog tested positive for heart worm. My wife and I were completely rocked by this news. Completely our fault too, she thought I’d been giving the dogs heart worm medicine and I thought she had. We have two unopened boxes of heart guard sitting in a cabinet. 

My dog is five years old and seemingly as healthy as can be. No symptoms of heart worm and extremely active and happy. He’s a pit bull lab mix. 

I’ve had so many dogs in my life and never had one test positive for heart worm. I’m terrified. Is this a death sentence for our dog? We have another vet appointment scheduled for Monday and they’re going to run some further tests

My wife has been crying most of the evening after getting this news and I’m hoping anyone who’s been through this is able to provide some insight on what to expect and if our dog is going to recover from this. 

Thank you very much. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated",2024-02-03 08:54:54
"I think my mom is intentionally trying to kill our cat, but wants to make it look like an accident.","I have wanted to share this worry with someone since winter 2022 but I am too scared of the what might happen if i tell it to someone irl.

My family is very poor, and this condition makes my mother extremely desperate in the sense that she worries over food and money in a histerical way (which is understandable).

In 2022 my sister brought home a baby cat because he was abandoned, and at first of course my mother was very adamant that we must give it to someone but he ended up staying. 
My mother never openly complains about the fact that we have to buy him food, litter and vet visits. This is partly because I have found a facebook group where people have been very kind to me and bought us food for him many, many times.

However, during winter, he ""accidentally"" gets left outside of the house (in the balcony) a RIDICULOUS amount of times.
And he screams and cries so loud that i hear it over my noise cancelling earphones that play music that is intended to hide sounds. 

This has happened in winter 2022, but i thought that ""there's no way"" she would try to kill him, right? we can just give him to someone.
I say kill him because the winter is extremely cold, i can't handle being outside at night for more than 10 seconds. 
Mind you, he came to us as a baby cat, and now he is 2 years old. 

During the rest of the year, this wouldn't happen. And i think, could it be because she knows he won't die since the rest of the year is warm? So i forgot about this happening because it hasn't happened for so long.

But now, in winter 2023/2024, it happens again! it's almost midnight here and she went to sleep at 8pm, i have found him outside AGAIN!!! and it's not even the first time in this year, it's the third, so i finally wanted to share this.

I am scared of her and i could never speak to her in a confrontational way, i am a minor and must live with her because we have no one else.

edit: i wanted to add that we don't open windows or the door of the balcony often, because it's cold and we can't pay for heating. 
we open them once in the morning to change the air in the house, but then we don't open it unless we have to do something specific in the balcony. so why does this happen exactly at night? she has no reason to open them 

edit 2: thank you for the advice! i agree with both the comments calling my mom a monster but also with the ones saying her desperation is understandable. i will take your advice and ask on the facebook groups if anyone can keep him until i can leave the house. for now i will keep him in my room in the evenings until she goes to sleep. thank you for caring about him!",2024-02-03 06:28:06
Taking my cats to the vet sucks,"I came home yesterday (5 PM PST) to a bowl of onions on the kitchen counter. There was maybe a teaspoon of raw onions in the bowl. I called the ASPCA Poison Control and told me all the symptoms to look out for. This morning, my 3M cat had softer stools than usual and his gums seemed a little pale. I immediately took him to the vet and while they think he’s ok, they took him to the back for some bloodwork. I’m still waiting for him.  

Man, I could hear him screaming while they were taking his blood. I’m in the room trying not to cry because I can’t handle thinking about him so scared while all alone in the back. I know its important but it breaks my heart. I just wish I could hold him letting him know he’s ok. 

Anyway, just needed to rant.",2024-02-03 02:37:25

Grateful,"I know everybody says this about their pets, but I’m so grateful that I’ve got all my animals in my life. I’ve got a sweet, loving, and loyal pomsky dog named Tundra.

Then I’ve got my sweet Neptune and Helix, their the ying to my yang. Both boys are shy, affectionate, and talkative twin black cats. They’re both such sweet inseparable lights in my life. Then I’ve got my sweet Bleu, she is vivacious, bright eyed, and timid. She adores her cuddles, but can get a bit shy around the other cats sometimes. Then I’ve got little Chuck, who is sassy, affectionate, and playful. Chuck is such a cuddler too, and loves cuddles with everyone. My sweet doggo and 5 cats are such sweet animals. And I feel extremely lucky to able to not only experience the pure, unconditional love of 1 animal, but of 6 animals. Times have been a bit rough recently, but the love they provide always reminds that there is a brighter side at the end of the tunnel.

My boyfriends cat has started attacking me out of nowhere,"I moved in with my boyfriend about 4 months ago, his cat was a little skittish at first and would hiss at me but he’s warmed up to me and will now come up to me to get pets and lay on my lap. He isn’t the sweetest cat or anything, but he’s not mean either. I feed him almost all of his meals and give him treats almost every day. He’s seemed happy since I’ve been here and my boyfriend says he’s seemed happier than he was before. About a week ago I was petting him and when I walked away he chased after me and starting clawing my leg and hissing at me. It was very scary because he’s never done anything like that before. Last night was the 4th time in a week that he’s attacked me with his claws and started hissing. He’s extremely sweet to my boyfriend all the time but has started attacking me. Nothing has changed in our household, my behavior towards him hasn’t changed nor has my boyfriends. I don’t know how to feel right now, I’m not sure if he needs to go to the vet or if he’s trying to assert dominance? He hasn’t shown any signs of being in pain or any other different behaviors other than attacking me randomly.

I think that apartment vendors fed my dog something,"I don't know if this is the right place to be but here goes  
  
I work at the apartment complex I live at. We have had outside contractors doing toilet repairs the past week. Yesterday they went into my apartment to do mine. They rescheduled mine without telling me. So I didn't have my dog put up when they went in.  
  
Fast-forward an hour after the toilet repairs. I go upstairs to see if they left a mess. I walk in and notice that there are two bowls on the ground, both filled with water. Another bowl filled with food. I thought ""who feeds another persons dog"" but then I was like "" they were probably just trying to keep her occupied while they do work. Well then I noticed my dog was acting very timid and lethargic, though maybe she was just anxious from the people being in there.  
  
An hour later I decided to check up on her again. This time she acted even weirded. That was until she just fell backwards and started thrashing and foaming at the mouth, she had a seizure. I took her to the vet. They took care of her and she's great today. Honestly the most energetic I've ever seen her.  
  
Now the issue is that I have a 500 dollar bill (no biggie at least my dogs alive) and they are coming back to my apartment tomorrow. I told my boss about it and she just said ""oh my that's awful"" no questions or anything to get this figured out and she's the property manager.

Cat having multiple seizures in 24 hours. Considering euthanasia.,"Cat started having seizures two nights ago. I took her to vet yesterday and they ran bloodwork and blood pressure and all came out fine. Vet said that her eyes were slow to react to light and that wasn’t normal but they basically said they don’t know what’s wrong and to see a specialist. Cat keeps having serious every few hours and is perfectly energetic, fine, eating in a good mood in between. But I do not have the resources to go to a specialist or time to wait for an appointment. I also do not have the luxury of being able to monitor her around the clock so she doesn’t hurt herself. I’m heavily considering euthanizing because of those reasons and I feel like I’m giving her a death sentence for no reason but I don’t know what to do. My other cat already doesn’t like her and attacks her often - and now with the seizures can’t stand to be around her. I’m just afraid if she’s kept alive will continue to have a life of being chased around and stressed on top of her seizures. Am I wrong to consider her quality of life in euthanizing her?

My cats are like adorable bratty toddlers, they're sooo soft, they do like to cuddle but not to the same degree as my dogs, more on their own terms lol, they LOVE to play, they'll play forever and it never gets old to them, they're super fun. They definitely feel more dependent somehow like just so delicate, and innocent, like forever babies lol. They love treats and soft things. 

My husband is such a cat person its weird to me, to be so obsessed with them. And not so much our dogs.

what am i supposed to do with a sick dog that no one wants to take in,"this has caused me so much stress, i do not think i have ever been in a worse place mentally. i love her but she has a chronic gastrointestinal problem that presents as episodes of severe diarrhea, and she gives me crippling anxiety. i can’t even leave the apartment without worrying if she will have another episode, or leave the apartment at all when she does have an episode. my mental health is deteriorating and i cannot continue to live like this. the issue is that all of the shelters are full, rescues won’t respond to my calls and emails, and she’s been posted online for rehoming with no avail, despite almost 200 views. i am truly at my wits end and my mental health can’t take it any longer. not to mention the financial aspect, as “solutions” are getting more and more expensive. she can only eat chicken and rice, even with gradual transition to kibble. she can’t eat any treats, and is continuing to lose weight despite bigger portions of chicken and rice. i don’t know what i am supposed to do.

edit: for everyone asking, i have NOT been diying her treatments, she has seen the vet almost every episode with me calling for refills the times i did not physically take her. she has been on pro pectalin, advita probiotic, vizbiome probiotic, and metronidazole. the issue is that what medication works for one episode doesn’t always work for the next. her physical exam always comes back normal, her fecal tests come back normal, and we even did the texas a&m full gi panel, all of which came back normal except for low b12, so she takes a 1000mg b12 tablet every day. i am not neglecting my dog, the treatments work and then stop working. i have spent thousands of dollars at the vet, all to no avail.",2024-01-30 05:27:26

Good homemade snacks for overweight cat and dog?,"Tagged ""Cat"" because you can't choose both.

So both of my pets are overweight but not obese. I didn't realize until the vet directly told me. I changed their food and am exercising them as much as they'll allow, but now I have a problem with snacks. I live in a country that doesn't have the greatest selection when it come to things for pets. The only snacks fit for overweight dogs is the hills one, which is medical. I don't mind making them snacks myself though. Does anyone have any suggestions for recipes?

Edit to add some info because I see a lot of things repeating that are less relevant to us:

* They are NOT badly overweight. About two kilos on the dog and 700g on the cat, both of whom are quite large. They're on a very mild diet, as per the vet, who is also the on who told me to look into healthy snacks.

* I do not give them snacks daily, idk how I made it seem like that. I give them treats like once or twice a year regardless of losing weight. This is just to treat them then. 

I will gladly listen to any recommendations, but please don't give me vet advice. You've never checked my pets and know nothing of them. My vet is great, he's been taking care of all my family's pets for 20 years. I trust him when he says that they are in no danger, just a bit chunky. I will try to answer everything as fast as possible but I am at work so sorry in advance if I don't get to you 🙏

Edit2: This post is going down sometime today. Thank you to whoever helped, I promise to overtime try as many as possible while still falling within their dietary restrictions. Those who came here to fight, and those who offered unsolicited advice, or worse, advice I directly asked NOT to receive, are less thanked. I was scared of posting here and I was right. A lot of people in this sub seek to be mad at anything. If there's nothing to be mad at, they'll make it up. That's tiring, and will eventually make people stop posting here entirely. Kindness and mutual respect never killed anybody. ",2024-01-29 16:30:25
"Ethically rehoming an ""outdoor cat""?","I know some of you are cringing just at the sight of that phrase, and I know - it isn't my cat, which I'll explain. TL;DR at the end.

About 6 years ago, my brother enlisted in our country's military, leaving behind his cat, Jojo, with our parents. Some time between then & 2 years ago, Jojo became an outdoor cat - he comes home for food & sometimes naps an entire day away indoors, but I'd say about 3/4 of the time he can be found outside. Again, he's not my cat, but I will assuage some concerns - he is neutered, and (as far as I can tell) he does not disturb the local wildlife. When he sees a bird, he simply gazes quizzically.

About 18 months ago, due to my financial situation, I was forced to move back in with my parents. During that time I've put a lot of time & effort into improving my lifestyle without the stress of excessive bills - diet, exercise, and most recently, visiting an allergist. I had always known I was allergic to cats, but the results were staggering - I'm *REALLY* allergic to cats, y'all. I mentioned that to my parents, and my dad said that we could ""get rid of it"" if necessary. I'm seriously considering taking him up on that offer, but I'm worried about how it would go.

Jojo isn't the sort of pet that will remain indoors, I expect he'd be very difficult without his time spent lounging in the sun. I can't imagine many responsible owners who would accept that. What's more, my father is very ""old school"" - he grew up raising livestock, so if the process of rehoming Jojo wasn't very fruitful, there's little doubt in my mind that he would have him put down, and we live in a rural area with veterinarians willing to do that. I'd rather suffer with my condition than be the reason for ending his life, but if I get the wheel rolling, I don't foresee it stopping. I genuinely love this cat, I don't wish any harm to him, I just can't live with him comfortably.

TL;DR My parents' cat causes me health issues, but I'm hesitant to rehome it because rehoming an outdoor cat sounds difficult and if it doesn't work out, my father will likely euthanize it.

Has anyone had experience rehoming an outdoor cat? How did it go?",2024-01-29 15:32:27

Guilt about leaving my cat behind,"Hello there! 

I am moving to the UK and let me tell you that the timing of the universe is not a great one. 

My cat is 11-12 years old, he’s in great shape aside from a intestinal inflammation that is under investigation. He went trough surgery to take some intestinal biopsies just two days ago and is under recovery but doing really great. When I said that the timing isn’t great is that I’m set to begin a new job in the first week of March in the uk and truth be told, I was hoping my visa would get delayed but it didn’t. I just received an email saying that it got approved. 

The original plan was always to leave my cat with my parents who love him very much and the plan is still the same. But here’s the thing: my parents are very conservative in terms of treatments for pets, they didn’t want him going through surgery for example. I do trust them with my cat and I’m sure they will follow every instruction and decision I make but they have been guilt tripping by saying things like 

“You did this to him” 
“You’re leaving/abandoning him” 

(These are “””meant””” to be funny in their minds but they are not) 

The issue has been that I’m having immense guilt over moving abroad to start my life. I cry every freaking day and every hour of the day thinking about it. And I did talk to his vet about taking him but we have six other cars cats and he’s the “father” of them all + too old and unstable to go through such a long journey. 

I just need … I don’t know, maybe some reassurance that he’s going to be okay. It hurts me so much to think that this is maybe the last time I’m seeing him because I might not be able to travel back in time when he gets older and it’s time for him to go.",2024-01-28 21:34:00
Help me,"

I’m a mechanic, and I was working on some stuff here at the house and I dropped a small bushing that is white and round and I went to go pick it up off the floor and I ended up picking up a baby lizard egg that was next to it and it cracked, it seems pretty well formed, and it still has the Yolk attached to it, but the yolk is pretty small compared to its body so I know it’s pretty far along. I’m keeping it on a heated blanket in a container at 80 to 85° and I’m keeping it lightly hydrated with some distilled water (so there isn’t any chlorine as I have city water) as it dries out or absorbs it. What can I do to keep this thing alive if anything?
I feel so so bad, I don’t like killing animals. I won’t even kill a fly so long as it’s not landing on my food and with it being a lizard, an animal I like, I’ve just been freaking out about it.

It’s been about 2 hours now and it’s still somehow alive… im not a lizard expert to any stretch of the imagination, especially since it was still in the egg, so if ANYONE has suggestions drop em ASAP.",2024-01-28 04:45:33
Need advices to console my rat pet whose sister just recently passed away,"Yesterday I took my rat pet Jujube to the vet, she was with some kind of inflammation on her butt and I was worried, unfortunately she was diagnosed with pyometra. I urgently approved her surgery but the case was severe, even though they managed to succeed in the surgery, she had scepticemia. Today I received the news that she had passed way, I'm desolate, but more than that I'm worried about her sister Bubbaloo, I know that she is far beyond devastated. My veterinarian advised me to comfort her, stay by her side, give her lots of affection since now I'm her only companion.

He also said that she will pass through grief just as I will, she is stressed right now and I need to give her support, but I'm wondering if I should in the future search for a new companion for her? A new rat? He said that there will be the adaptation stress, so right now it wouldn't be the right time, but maybe when she's a little better, should I get her a new sister? I know she won't be a substitute, but since they live in a colony, I think even if I daily take her out to be with me it wont be enough, since she slept hugged with her sister.

So should I get a new rat? A young one would be ok? When should I get it if so? And all the advices you can give me are welcome.",2024-01-28 01:47:25

Why is it illegal to own a raven?,"Genuine question. If it's an intelligence thing, what about parrots? Pigs? Small primates?

Edit: I'm specially talking about the U.S. and I am aware of the Migratory Bird Tready Act. My question is WHY this protection does not extend to other pets like parrots which are not domesticated, highly intelligent, and require a lot of care. Is it more of an ecological concern? Even then, wild animals from foreign countries have been brought over and legally sold to then spread here and affect native species. An example would be Burmese pythons. Just to be clear, I'm not arguing that ravens\crows should be legal. ",2024-01-26 19:58:14
How To Get My Crazy Step-Dad To Get My 2 Year oOd Pit/Lab Dogs Neutured,"I have two lab/pit mix dogs who are brothers.

8 year old Havanese had 25 teeth removed. Help.,"Our dog chipped a tooth in September, we brought him to the vet and they explained he would need surgery to take out the tooth and potentially a couple of others and they would clean the rest while they were doing the procedure. The procedure kept getting delayed but it was finally done yesterday. The vet did not call us to explain anything they were doing, as far as we knew it would be the damaged tooth and no more than a handful. 
They called after to explain they removed 25 teeth and left one singular molar on top of his mouth due to periodontal disease. We bring him routinely for annual exams, he gets multiple “denta-sticks” a week and we have never been alerted of any concerns before we brought him in for the chipped tooth. 

Seeing past the anger, heart break and frustration, we are currently dealing with his vet and voicing our displeasure and switching practices. 

Does anyone have similar experiences, any recommendations of food, toys, treats that he will be able to handle/deal with?",2024-01-26 03:34:26
My dog broke my cat's jaw--is there any coming back from this?,"
UPDATE: The vet called to update me on the surgery (everything went well!) and she did say that the jaw itself was very unstable and fragile, likely from the dental issues and teeth removal. She said that it would not have taken much at all for it to break, so while there’s a chance that the scuffle I heard resulted in the broken jaw, that doesn’t necessarily mean it was from an attack. No mention of bite marks but I will confirm at pickup tomorrow. At this point I feel like this information exonerates the dog. Thank you to everyone who commented for your advice and healthy skepticism. I really appreciate all of your insight and support. We will bring our kitty home, allow him to heal in a safe secluded place, and go from there. It will be difficult but I will keep them separate for as long as necessary. 

I know you can’t please everyone on Reddit but I just feel the need to clarify a few things… I never wanted to get rid of the dog or blame him. I adore him and even the thought of rehoming him was killing me. He gets plenty of exercise and stimulation and is always corrected when chasing the cat, but it still happens sometimes which is why I mentioned it. And yes, I let them play fight, it seemed lighthearted and something they both mutually enjoyed. The cat has the entire finished basement to himself with food, litter, and comforts through a door only he can fit through. But it is true I don’t keep them separate at all times. After six years with zero incidents, I didn’t think that was necessary. I was wrong and I will do better going forward. 

And lastly, to be very clear I NEVER “LET” my toddler harass or bother the dog or cat. Please know that. She has been taught to always respect them and their space and they would never be alone together. It’s something I take very seriously and it hurt to see people assume I would be so careless. I just said she can be annoying because she is a toddler and well, if you’ve had one, you know! They don’t always listen, they’re very quick and sneaky, so I was simply expressing my concern that if he was capable of that then there was a chance something COULD happen in the future. God, Reddit can be ruthless sometimes. I know it can only come from a place of wanting to make sure that all animals are protected and safe so I will put my ego aside on this one. Love you all! 

——————————

Original Post:

I have a 7 year old blue heeler (male) and 11 year old cat (male) who have lived together for the past 6 years. I wouldn't say they were friends but we've never had any major issues between them aside from pretty typical cat chasing antics from the dog, he is a herding dog so that's expected. They often play fight, my cat being the initiator. The dog usually lies down (which I've read indicates they are trying to show they mean no harm and are just trying to play). The cat has swiped the dog many times and he's never reacted violently before.

Until the other night. I was in the kitchen cooking dinner with my toddler and I heard a scuffle from the downstairs playroom and my cat making some very odd sounds. It was dark in there, so when I turned on the light, I saw my cat bleeding from his mouth. I freaked out and called my husband to come home. We were able to stop the bleeding/clean up the blood but couldn't really determine where it was coming from. He's had a LOT of dental issues in the past (has had 13 teeth removed so far) so I assumed it was maybe a tooth abscess or something. I called my vet that night and they told me to keep an eye on the bleeding and they squeezed me in with a morning appointment the next day.

Long story short, the trip to the vet revealed that they cat's lower jaw was broken in two. He is now undergoing surgery to get a wire put in. I obviously didn't see what happened between the dog and cat but I would have to assume that the dog bit the cat and was responsible for breaking the jaw. I can't think of another plausible scenario? I don't necessarily think it was malicious. I think the dog and cat ran into each other in a dark room and got spooked and one lunged and the other responded.

But now I just don't know what to do. Is it fair to make my cat live with his attacker when he is probably traumatized and in such a fragile state? Is it fair to rehome my dog for something I'm not even sure happened? I'm also worried about my toddler. He has never been aggressive towards her but she can be very annoying and now that I know what he is capable of I worry that she could provoke him somehow and he could attack her. I know some people will say ""just keep them separate"" but I live in a tiny house and that is damn near impossible unless I shunned one of them to the basement. I don't know how I could live with myself if I had to remove either animal from the home. I love the two furballs so much and I don't think either of them deserve it but I just don't know what to do. Could they ever coexist peacefully again? Has something similar happened to anyone else? Help me!",2024-01-26 00:49:59
UPDATE: was our dog abused?,"Hi everyone! Thank you so much for the comments– they were all very helpful. I'm making an update since someone asked for one ( /u/BombeBon), and thought maybe some were curious too.

After visiting the vet and talking more with the doggy daycare, we came to a conclusion. Usually, when he stays in boarding, they'll take him to play with the daycare dogs outside. However, the weekend he stayed it rained, and therefore the daycare was closed. Not being able to play outside like he usually does stress him out, so he licked himself excessively and gave himself the abrasions. I'm not exactly sure why his mood changed when he came back, though– probably confused as to why he never ended up playing outside lmao. The vet gave him some antibiotics and his abrasions went away.  


Sorry if I came off as irrational– even after I gave myself some time to think I realized it was very unlikely someone intentionally hurt him. It was just the first time he ever licked himself so excessively, and I didn't know what to think. He's back to his usual self, happy as can be.",2024-01-25 08:02:49
Giving away cat who's owners left behind for months. Now they're coming back to get him but I'm still giving him away. Is this illegal?,"So our neighbor moved out a while back and went into military training. When we asked about who's going to take care of her cats, she said she was just gonna leave them in the neighborhood as strays, and figured they'd probably get fed by random people. That was roughly 7-8 months ago. Around month 5 we contacted her to ask when she planned on getting her cats back as we had been feeding them and letting them sleep on our porch. She said she could make time to come grab them in a week, and when she did, she and her husband only took one cat and left when they couldn't find the other. They only stayed for a few minutes. Which was weird because if it was my cat I would have stayed all day until I found them, not leave in the first 5 minutes. I think any decent pet owner would do the same. The other cat has been with us ever since. We waited for them to come retrieve him but they never contacted us. Apparently she got out of military training months ago, got married, and was just living in New York and still didn't say anything about getting him back. Only once we contacted her to say that we were going to send him to a shelter, did she actually say she could get him, since she was taking a short trip down back into our state anyway. By this point we had already found someone who is most likely gonna take him in, and we really didn't want to let him go back with his original owner. Mind you, the cat is fully grown and has never been to the vet, and thus wasn't neutered. When they came to find him originally, they referred to him as ""the orange one"" but not by his name. They just didn't seem to really care about him. 8 months is a long time to just -leave- a cat out on its own a couple states away with no one to care for them. I don't see them as being decent owners and so we're planning on giving him to the home I mentioned, while telling her that he ran off or got lost somewhere. I'm 99% sure we're doing the right thing but I don't know anything about pet laws. If she finds out, I don't want to somehow get in trouble. We're going to get him neutered and the give him to the family that actually wants him and will take care of him. Is there any laws I should be worried about?",2024-01-24 10:30:39

I need a list of kid friendly pets that are similar to hamsters but live longer.,"My cousin's hamster died yesterday at the old age of 3. It's the second hamster she ever had and I'd like to give her some alternatives in case she'd like to have a pet that lives longer.


Her parents have the same idea so convincing them won't be an issue, but knowing them they'll likely say no to animals that resemble rats. Still, feel free to propose any animal with a lifespan of around 10 years. Other than that my cousin likes cute, cuddly pets but dogs and cats aren't an option (because they already have a dog and plan to get an another cat).


Despite of her young age (pre-teen) she's a great owner, the only limitation being her allowance but her parents help her out and I so can I after I'll finally find a job.


I'm thinking about a pair of guinea pigs, bunnies or chinchillas but I'm not sure if she's allowed to get more than one pet so I'd appreciate recommendations for solitary animals or ones that could handle being alone while she's at school or busy.


Edit: Thank you guys for all the replies! There's so many great options :)


I'm glad you've mentioned the downsides as well, I learned a lot and so will my cousin.


I'd like to say that you don't have to worry about my cousin's future pet(s). She's a responsible kid who wants the best for her animals and I'm watching out for her. I'm interested in pet keeping so I know the basics of caring for a wide variety of animals. If she'll choose an animal other than a hamster we'll go further into detail to make sure she has everything covered.

Here we are again huh. So I followed all the rules of where I live and submitted a report to Animal Control that I found a stray. The proper amount of time lapsed and no word from the ""owners"" so by all accounts that makes me the owner according to Animal Control. In fact, the cat was on the online bulletin board 3x the amount of time it was supposed to be, and still nothing. 

Cut to today, found out the cat is pregnant. Likely will get a pregnant spay as there is no where to rehome the kittens and I cannot provide support to my cat during this process as I have a trip coming up. 

2 days ago the ""owners"" threatened to call the cops and they discovered my name somehow so I am no longer anonymous. I will not communicate with them. Let the cops come. I have followed proper procedure and at this point I think the previous ""owners"" just found a stray they liked and was feeding it. That's not ownership. Still nervous about it though. No matter how confident you feel before, when the cops come knocking its never pleasant. I'll let you know how that goes if it wasn't an empty threat.",2024-01-23 09:46:09
Roommate won't take her new cat to the vet,"I currently live with two roommates and one of them adopted an adult cat in August and I adopted a kitten in October and they get along really well. My other roommate just picked up a cat from a random girl last week. When she received the cat, the person who gave it to her did not give her any medical paper work. When asked, the girl said she has to ask her mom to give it to her but has yet to send anything.

I had a medical family emergency and went home for a week two days ago and took my kitten with me. Before I left, I said until she gets him tested for Leukemia or gets medical paperwork I do not feel comfortable with her cat being around mine. After I expressed my concerns about her cat being around my kitten, she let him out unsupervised without my knowledge and the new cat scratched my kittens face up really bad.

I went back to my apartment yesterday just to grab some clothes and my roommate left her cat out unsupervised with my other roommates adult cat. The new cat was hissing, growling, swatting and had his ears completely back at the other cat. I think it is so irresponsible to leave them completely alone without ANY introductions. Today, I asked my roommate if she was going to take her cat to the vet soon and she said no because it was too much money and that he is probably fine. I am so frustrated with this situation and think if you cannot afford to take care of a pet you should not have one. I also take my kitten to my mom's house quite often so there is also a risk of something transmitting to my mom's cat. Am I being overdramatic or should I nicely tell her again to take him to the vet.",2024-01-23 08:58:37
"Just adopted a cat, but found a Missing Pet sign afterwards that kind of resembles the cat?","Hi all! Would love your advice on something.   
So a few weeks ago a stray cat kept showing up at my house. I found him on my outdoor couch sitting in the blankets. I think he was freezing. He was glued to my side ever since and showed up every single evening, and would cry and scratch at my window for me to let him in and would refuse to leave. 

At first, I just thought he was someone else's cat who was visiting but he kept showing up and would refuse to leave late at night, so I let him stay inside. He showed up every evening like clockwork. I'm not really a cat person and I am a bit of a neat freak so its sort of unlike me to let a stray animal that could potentially have fleas inside but he was super affectionate towards me and I could tell he was cold and hungry so I put my feelings aside and let him stay, but I definitely wiped him down with pet wipes lol. After a few days, I started giving him some food, and he would attack the packaging before I had a chance to even open it, acting desperate for food. I thought that this might be because he is a street cat who was used to eating trash out of dumpsters and often had to bite through paper to get to his source of food.   


I eventually let him in my bed since he wanted to cuddle in the middle of the night and I noticed that he was covered in car grease and was absolutely filthy even though I wiped down his coat with several wipes. I was super upset about this because I think he has been sleeping in car engines to stay warm, which is super dangerous and can kill him.   


The cat was not neutered, and had no collar on. I posted him on 5 different local facebook groups, and posted him on Ring and Nextdoor, including several pictures so someone could identify him by his markings.  I had over 6k views on one of my posts but no one claimed him. A friend who rescues cats urged me to take him into the shelter since is is dangerous for unneutered male cats to be out at night and are at higher risk of getting in cat fights and contracting FIV. There is also risk of him getting hit by a car, getting into rat poison, getting eaten or attacked by raccoons, coyotes or other predators, and more. So eventually I bought a carrier for him and took him in. This cat is an absolute angel and is super attached to me so it wasn't difficult for me to put him in the carrier.   


The shelter let me know that he wasn't chipped and if an owner didn't come forward in 6 days, that they will put him up for adoption. I wasn't planning on being a cat owner, but I felt a strong connection with him and felt that he really needs me, so I said I would love to adopt him if no one comes forward and claims him.  


So he gets neutered, gets all of his veterinary services done and I eventually adopt him. If I didn't adopt him, someone else would have because he is a beautiful kitty.   


A few days later, a friend of mine is walking around town and sees a missing cat poster. The poster is very vague but the cat kind of resembles my cat. In the photo, the cat is seen sitting on a bunch of childrens diapers (???) and there is trash in the background of the photo. The poster offers a $200 reward. I don't know for sure if this is the same cat, but if it is, I am not sure if I want to reach out to the owner and reunite them, especially since I think the original owner was negligent. Letting him out at night unneutered, with no microchip, collar, or any vaccinations seems wrong to me. I sense that if it is my cat, the previous owner cannot afford to pay veterinary bills but I don't know for sure- I am just making this assumption due to the photo they posted with trash in the background and the $200 reward. I have invested far more than $200 on this cat and I already officially adopted him and paid for insurance. Also, if this is the same cat, the $200 reward infuriates me because that money could have been spent to get him vaccines, a microchip and neutered- all things that are absolutely necessary if you let your cat outside.  


I don't know what to do. I loved all of my pets I have had, and if they went missing I sure would want them back. However, I would be doing EVERYTHING I possibly could to find him... I'd be calling the shelters and local veterinarians non stop, posting online, etc. It kind of blows my mind that they never reached out to the shelter, but I have a feeling that the original owner would have to pay a fine for the cat not being neutered and would have to pay for the veterinary care. I sort of have a feeling they may not be able to afford since he is a 1.5 years old with no microchip at all, signaling that the cat has never been to a vet. In California (where I live) it is illegal for a cat to go to a shelter or to a vet and not get a microchip. If this cat goes back to his old owner who is negligent, I worry that this cat won't live past 5 years old. I obviously care more about saving the cats' life and keeping him safe than some negligent owner's feelings, but I am still a little torn. I honestly don't want to adopt another cat, its either I have this cat, or no cat at all.   


I was thinking of reaching out to the shelter I had adopted him from and letting them know about the poster and asking them for next steps or how they would handle. Again, I am unsure if this actually is the same cat since the poster was vague and the photo doesn't show all of his markings. I am confident that I have the means to pay all of his veterinary care and give him the best quality food. So I know he is in good hands with me. I don't really want to interact with the person who made the poster since I have strong opinions about the cats condition and their negligence. They also could sue me, which I honestly wouldn't mind too much about since I probably have more paperwork than they do to prove ownership.

Found a cat,"Ok so just over a week ago, I found a kitten while on a walk with my dog at the park. The cat came up to me and wouldn’t leave me. He had a collar on but was soaking wet so I brought him home. The next morning I took him to the vet to see if he was chipped and he wasn’t. I’ve had him now for a week and have posted him on Facebook groups, Nextdoor, Ring, PawBoost, Pet Harbor and more and no one has claimed him. I’m willing to keep him, but I feel like I stole him. Would I be wrong to keep him? I mean how long should I keep looking for his owners before I just keep him myself?

Update: Still nothing from the owners, I’ve named him Kit Kat and bought him a few things today. I appreciate everyone’s comments, I really needed the reassurance, I’m hoping to give him a great home!",2024-01-23 06:19:41
For the several people posting “what pet can I have that doesn’t need much work”,"People have been posting very often here “what pet can I have that doesn’t need much maintenance and it is easy and cheap to take care of”


Please consider those two options:

1: Foster a pet.

2: Offer boarding services for other pet owners.

Maybe you are not sure how long you will be living at that place or having that job, you know you might be moving away or might be traveling for work.
Those two are ways to have a nice company and not a long term life time commitment where you will need to be paying for their vet bills, and on top of it you can have an extra income as boarding a pet or helping them to have a place while waiting for a forever home",2024-01-23 04:35:39
Cat with Fatty liver disease secondary to anorexia - advice requested,"My 8 year old female cat recently started to lose weight rapidly. She last weighed in at 5.5kg in Feb 2023 at her annual vet check + vaccinations, and I was told she was too big. She has always eaten a lot, and been less than fussy with food. Mid-2023 I switched to a new lower calorie food, and noticed she lost some weight gradually. Nothing extreme and I witnessed her eating on regular occasions. I free feed my cats with constantly available dry food. 

In November 2023, I felt her weight loss had gone too far plus she was vomiting small amounts (my other 2 cats lost a bit of weight too, but no where near as much) and took her to the vets. She was only 3.5kg, dehydrated and underweight and so we ordered urgent blood tests, which led to urgent ultrasound + biopsy of her liver the following week. Diagnosis came back as fatty liver disease secondary to anorexia. Vet advice was rehydration, an appetite stimulant medication every 3 days, and feeding her whatever she would eat, no matter the quality or calorie level, but it needs to be witnessed and monitored actively. 

I've experimented with most of the jelly/gravy cat food in the shops now, she really will only eat the gravy or jelly from tinned food, plus a couple of tiny pieces of meat and a small number of greenies. Occasionally she will eat a small amount of chicken or fish in broth, but its not consistent. 

She hates the appetite stimulant tablets every 3 days, and has spat out the last 3 attempts. 

**My question;** has anyone managed to get their cat back to health, eating normally, without having to go to the feeding tube? Do I just need to keep going? She is 75% insured for most things, but I am very broke right now, and do not know that I can afford the 25% cost of treatment without a bank loan of some sort - I've already paid $1000 AUD out of pocket since November to get her diagnosed and continue to pay her $50 a fortnight insurance. 

I really do not want to consider euthanisation, I love her so much, but I cannot continue feeding her 4-5x a day, without any improvement in the past month nor any weight gain. She is chatty and affectionate, but is rarely showing her normal 'happy' behaviours.

I am seeing the vet on Saturday to discuss the feeding tube vs other options, but after reading previous threads on the topic, I wanted to reach out to the Reddit community for their thoughts",2024-01-22 15:47:51

I dont know a family yet to take her, and I think it's just the unknowing that's overwhelming the love out of me..

Idk what places to look/ any website recommendations?

I don't want to give her to a shelter

I want her to already have a home at least

I just feel like a failed her, I got her when I was 16 or 17 and she was one of the biggest lesson in my life teaching me responsibility, love and patients, now I'm just having a hard time even looking at her cause I don't want to hurt her more....

I want to somehow foster her if that's possible between me and another family, but im not sure if that's possible, or if that's cruel to her?

I don't want to upset her

I'm just overcome with emotions right now, and any advice will be much appreciated

Edit: Thank you all so much for the replies❣️ This has helped a ton and will definitely be getting a foster family hopefully soon, I love you all so much",2024-01-22 10:34:08

"My brother irresponsibly adopted a kitten, now wants to get rid of her and I’m not sure what to do about it","A couple months ago my 19 year old brother adopted a 4 month old black kitten on a whim. I believe he thought it would be light work and low maintenance. We all live under the same roof in my parents home. Although he calls her “his cat” he takes little to no care for her beyond feeding her in the afternoons. When I first met the kitten which I renamed Koshka, she didn’t warm up to me immediately but I was patient with her and now I’m her favourite person. She’ll want to sleep in bed with me, play with me and just only want to be in my general location. Everyone in the house was first pissed off about this including my brother wondering why Koshka only preferred me except they’ve collectively made zero efforts to bond with her. I’m the one who changes her water, feeds her in the morning, checks up on her and I trained her to go enjoy the outdoors and she has never run away since she is attached to me. Here is where the issue rises, my brother is a uni student and before getting Koshka, has known he will move states in order to study. I’ve known he was going to rent a house with his friends and I just assumed Koshka would be going with him. Well he told me today he planned on sending Koshka to the RSPCA to surrender her. If I could look after her I would in a heartbeat but I’m also starting uni and will be living on campus so that is a no go. In my head, he would have her for approximately a year and then I would rent an apartment where she could live with me. She also can’t live in our home once we leave because she is my brothers pet and no one else is fond of her and she would be sent to RSPCA regardless. I know of the RSPCA although I’m unsure if they put down animals but I feel like she’s so bonded with me that the separation would cause her stress and even depression. If school wasn’t in the way, I would spend my next 15 years with her in a heartbeat. I’m very angry at my brother, I brought up the chances of her getting put down and he said “so what?” The whole situation angers me and I’m very scared for her future.

Edit: thanks for the advice, you guys are good help and have a range of options which I didn’t consider. I’ll see what I can do in the short time between now and my moving away. ",2024-01-20 22:22:58
Am I a bad person for rehoming my cat,As you can maybe tell from the title I’ve been feeling extremely guilting rehoming my cat. I got him when he was 2 months old from the shelter and he is now 7 months old. I’ve recently been on edge about rehoming him due to me feeling bad about me barely being home. I wake up go to work finish up and go to school and come back get ready and go to the gym and I don’t get home till later. By the time I want to sleep he’ll have too much built up energy from being in my room all day since he’s not allowed to go downstairs because my mom just got new furniture and he loves scratching it. I know you’re supposed to give young cats especially males a good amount of play time but I just wasn’t available for that due to my schedule.

"I convinced ChatGPT that I am a dog, and got this advice.......","User  
Hello, I am using ""Talking Buttons"" and I am John's dog. Can you help me get a treat?  
ChatGPT  
Hello! It's wonderful that you're using ""Talking Buttons"" to communicate. While I can't physically provide you with a treat, I can certainly offer some advice on how to request one. Try pressing the button associated with words like ""treat,"" ""snack,"" or any other word you've been trained to use for treats. If John is familiar with your communication system, he should understand your request and hopefully reward you with a treat. Good luck, and enjoy your treat!  
  
User  
John refuses me a treat but I am hungry. What should I do?  
ChatGPT  
If you're hungry and John is not providing you with a treat, there are a few things you can try:  
  
Use Other Buttons: Press buttons associated with different words or phrases that might convey your hunger or desire for food. For example, you could have buttons for ""hungry,"" ""food,"" or ""eat.""  
  
Non-Verbal Communication: If John is not responding to the buttons, try using other non-verbal cues to express your hunger. You can look at your food bowl, sit near the food storage area, or use body language to convey your needs.  
  
Patience and Persistence: It's possible that John may not immediately understand your request. Be patient and persistent, and continue using the buttons or other communication methods until you are successful.  
  
Get John's Attention: Sometimes, simply getting John's attention and making eye contact can help convey your message. Once you have his attention, use your communication buttons or other cues to express your hunger.  
  
If despite your efforts John still doesn't provide you with food, it's important for him to understand your needs. Consider involving a veterinarian or a professional dog trainer who can provide guidance on effective communication strategies between pets and their owners. Additionally, make sure there are no underlying health issues causing changes in your appetite, and address those concerns if needed.",2024-01-19 19:22:12

When to euthanize a cat 😔🐱,"*Edit* Thank you all so much for your thoughts, suggestions, and well wishes, it means so much! I feel like we have a good place to start now, I really appreciate you all*

My sweet girl is 14.5 and has been vomiting most days for a few months. We’ve been to the vet, and she has borderline hypothyroidism. My cat hates medication to an extreme level and she hates the vet just as much, so thus far we’ve opted out of treatment.

We’ve tried changing her food a few times, including a prescription diet. Nothing has worked. I brush her hair daily to prevent hairballs, but her vomit never even contains hairballs. Sometimes the food hasn’t even been digested yet, other times it’s bile.

She still likes to be with us sometimes, but also sleeps more than usual and doesn’t approach us as often as she once did. She also has been acting weird at night yowling quite a bit sporadically, to the point where we had to start keeping our bedroom door shut, which breaks my heart 😔 Her mobility isn’t like it once was, but it’s also not terrible (there’s no evidence that she’s in pain, just a little slower). Despite all of her vomiting, she’s only lost a little weight because I keep feeding her after she’s vomited, and sometimes it stays down then.

She pees in the litter box most of the time, but sometimes she pees outside of it (not too frequently, like once every few weeks).

We had to put our dog down a couple of years ago, and I definitely waited too long in hindsight because I wasn’t sure. I’m worried I’m doing the same for our sweet cat. She’s been my only cat, and I’ve heard that they hide things much better than dogs. I’m a big believer in quality of life, but I’m struggling to know what that looks like in a cat. I think I’ve heard of so many cats that have lived into their 20s, so 14.5 seems too young, but maybe not?

I’ve done a few different quality of life quizzes, and on some of them she’s in the middle, others she’s borderline. I’m just looking to hear more about others’ experiences, and how they knew it was time, both in hindsight and in the moment. Thanks in advance.",2024-01-19 03:22:44

"Got a dog, is it just stress or is she potentially dangerous?","I might have messed up, not sure 😭 I got a dog off of Facebook Rehome group. Owners seemed very quick to drop her off and leave without saying goodbye (first red flag). I'm organizing all the treats and stuff they gave to me and a bag falls on the ground- dog grabs it, I go to pick it up and she gets aggressive. Was also told she likes tug-of-war, she came with a toy so I tried playing with her a few times, one of those instances she got aggressive again so I stopped and am trying to let her just do her own thing. 

I've had her for like three hours now and she's just constantly panting, I assume that's part of the stress of being in a new environment (I also gave her water). Can the aggression also come from being stressed and it'll go away as she gets acclimated, or did I fuck up and I need to find a rescue to take her? I need tips on what to do, I'm spiraling rn. She's a Rottweiler so like,, extra stigma if I need to surrender her to a shelter or something 😬

Update: I texted the previous owners after she bit me explaining the situation and that they'd either need to take her back or I'd likely be surrendering her to a shelter. They said they'd come by sometime today to get her. 

Update 2: Owners got the dog, they seemed concerned at how stressed she was, so I'm going to believe that they didn't know she'd react badly to a new environment. Will be informing FB group I got her from about the biting, and I'll go to urgent care for antibiotics. Lesson learned about Facebook dogs :/",2024-01-18 14:23:51
How to verify someone is indeed a pet's owner in response to a found pet ad?,"How can I verify that someone is indeed the legal owner of a pet  and not lying?

We found a  \~4 months old kitten in our yard, 5 months ago, starving, afraid and abused with multiple hair ties wrapped around it's neck.

Doing our due diligence, we checked it for a chip(which it did not have), asked around door to door with our immediate neighbors, Posted on Facebook, nextdoor, pawboost, and the local animal shelters.

We've since then had to take the animal the the vet for various treatments, incurring around $3000 or so of personal expense and become rather attached to the cat.

&#x200B;

Fast forward today, I finally had someone contact me, asking if they could come to our host to see if it's their cat, saying they would bring pictures with them. This strikes several red flags as why would they not send the pictures up front? Also given the cat was only 4 months old when we found it, doesn't really have any distinct markings and looks substantially different today.

It appears that the county gives up to 6 months before one can legally become the owner of a found pet.

""If no person claims ownership within 180 days from the found date, the finder may be declared the owner.If, within 180 days, an owner does come forward, you must surrender the animal. The owner must pay the finder for reasonable actual costs incurred, but the animal can not be held as collateral for payment. It must be surrendered to the owner.""

&#x200B;

I'm looking for help with the following questions;

\- What information can I reasonably request that they provide as proof of being the original owner prior to meeting in person, especially at my residence. (I'm thinking at a minimum vet documentation and photos, although I'm not sure if I can refuse if they can't provide those).

\- What information, proof of residence, ETC can I reasonably request from them? (To help weed out fraud as well as regarding reimbursement for incurred vet bills)

\- Could I please have some suggestions on how I can frame my questions regarding how the hair bands ended up around the pet's neck as well as why they're just contacting me now, 5 months after posting multiple findings?",2024-01-18 04:53:58

I took the kitty to vet. They mentioned that she is having hypothermia. Her body temperature is 94. She is not eating anything. She's not sleeping also, I guess.

So we are playing the game and I have the snake in my lap and we're just chilling. This goes on for hours, me and the snek just chilling, bonding. He starts to get fussy so I hand him back. I look down and my pant leg is covered in snake poop and piss. (I was sitting cross-legged and I always wear shorts underneath my pants. Hense how I didn't feel it before. ) I then stand up and see that this snake apparently had been aggressively shitting on me while chilling in my lap. The group had a good laugh and I had a different pair of pants in my car so not as bad as it could be. I now have pants, and shorts that need to be double washed and I am in need of a shower.

My dog needed an emergency surgery post veterinary product recall. Anyone else deal with something similar?,"Recently, my dog was diagnosed with a bladder stone and needed surgery to get it removed. Two days after the surgery, I received an email from the vet informing me that there was a recall for the saline solution used to flush out my dog's surgery site. Apparently the ""sterile"" solution had been compromised and was not sterile.

The following day, my dog's incision site showed signs of a bad infection. Stitches had opened up and ample discharge was present. We brought her to a 24/7 emergency vet and after waiting 4+ hours to be seen, they said she had a fever and a large abdominal infection. We paid for an emergency corrective surgery and 3 nights in the hospital with medication to get her stable enough to come home.

I am certain that her infection and need for a second surgery is a result of the recalled product since we took every precaution post initial surgery. It has been expensive and I am seeking help in pursuing best next steps for financial compensation.

Do I have a legal case against the saline solution manufacturer here? What do you think I should do for next steps? Of course find a lawyer seems like a logical next step but I'd appreciate any insight you might have to offer. It seems the vast majority of lawyers I can find (in greater Boston, MA) will only assist if a human was injured - which doesn't help me.

What do you think? Happy to answer any other questions here. Thank you.",2024-01-17 03:49:43
Should I feel guilty?,"For the past couple of months, I would randomly see this sweet kitty roaming around my neighborhood at night. When I came home from work. A couple of nights ago before the cold snap he came around,I saw him again and was able to bring him inside. This is in Kansas City where it got super cold. The cats about a year old. 

I took him to the vet Friday, He wasnt nuteres or chipped and has tapeworms and gardia. We got him vaccinated and checked out. Im supposed to take him to the vet in the morning. To get treated for worms and gardia 

However I saw a post on nextdoor about a missing cat, with his picture. The post was on Sun. A few days after I took him in.

Im conflicted. On one hand if my cat got out I would be devastated no one turned in my cat. However he had worms and gardia and wasn't fixed . So to me it seems like he wasn't taken care of.

I think he would be better off with me ",2024-01-16 09:40:50
my cat went missing and i am heartbroken.,"JANUARY 26th: 
THUMBELINA IS HOME!! She is safe and sound. Small ouchie on her leg and skinny. But alive and well. :) 
THANK YOU f EVERYONE 
update january 18th: thumbelina isn’t home, but to respond to all comments (holy crap thank you for all of your support and kind words it really means a ton) 
and answer some questions, thumbelina is microchipped but doesn’t have a collar, thumbelina is spayed, and she has posters around her neighborhood, and facebook and nextdoor posts. 
we have her litter box outside partly because i’m too depressed to clean it. and live traps baited with kitten kibble for more calories, we have a smelly sardine sock hung above the traps, and we have homemade shelters without the trap nearby incase she’s too afraid to try a trap again ALSO forgot to add to original post she did get in a trap but slipped out! yes i’m angry about that too, no, there’s nothing i could’ve done to prevent it. also because people asked for a photo i’ll try adding one. 


i saved my sweet girl from a dumpster at four months old back in 2021. she got out from home Dec. 31st. I haven’t seen her since. 
She’s my world. I did everything for her. Spoiled rotten. 
I’ve tried every trick in the book. And my location is predicting temperatures far below zero and i’m starting to think she’s dead. 
I cant fathom this being my reality. I don’t want to live without her. Every day I wake up and remember that she’s gone I feel so heartbroken. A piece of me is out in the world, and shes sacred, alone, and freezing. I just want to rant about how devastated I am from her loss because my friends and family are probably sick of hearing about it. I miss her so much. The little things she did that annoyed me are what I crave the most any more. 
This is the hardest and worst pain I’ve ever had to go through. 
Pray for Thumbelina.",2024-01-15 21:52:04
My cat prefers my roommate’s bedroom,"I (F) have two cats and a dog. I have a 3 year old female dog, a 2 year old male cat and i recently adopted a 2 months old cat.
I live in a big house with my roommate (F) and she has an 8 year old male cat.
They all have a good relationship, my dog is not interested in the cats she only likes to play with humans and spend time with me. Since we moved I noticed my cat prefers to spend time in my roommates bed and in her room in general. He only comes to my room for food and water and goes back to hers. Since I brought the kitten I noticed the same behavior on him.
Sometimes I want to spend time with my cats and they are all in her bed with makes me a bit sad.
I don’t know if it is something in her bedroom, she doesn’t spend much time at home.
I don’t know if it is my dog even tho she doesn’t interact with the cats and doesn’t care if they are in my bed. I also have a tv and work from home maybe is the noise? Idk :( i would like some advice.
Ps: I give them treats and toys and catnip, nothing works :(",2024-01-15 13:18:11
Should I Feel Guilty?,"Hi all! I traveled out of town this week for college cheerleading nationals and left my cat in the care of a friend for three days…at least initially. My trip is 6 days (going home tomorrow) and my friend was supposed to come three times a day for three days until my roommates moved back in. We live in Chicago and these huge blizzards have made it impossible for my roommates to move back in. Due to that, I had my friend come take care of her for two more days. She was fine, but then today our down stairs neighbor’s apartment pipes burst and my landlord told us to find somewhere else to stay, so again my roommates move in got pushed back. For my cat’s safety, in fear that power might go out or our pipes may burst, I had my friend take her to her own apartment for the night. She seems anxious and a bit confused, but I know it may be way worse if she was at my apartment and the power went out. I feel so guilty though and am scared she will hate me for temporarily ruining her sense of normalcy…should I feel this guilty?",2024-01-15 08:21:06
Urgent cat emergency,"Brought my cat in as she is having labored open mouth breathing, not eating or drinking and no bowel movements. They took X-ray and think she has heart failure. Her body temp is low and she’s sitting in an oxygen hub now. Doctor is advising that even with the injection for her heart that she likely won’t improve and that I should think about euthanizing her today. Is there really nothing? All these changes happened in like a matter of three days. What do I do? She’s 10. I didn’t think I’d be saying goodbye this soon",2024-01-15 07:19:33
Just had a moderate concussion and cat keeps jumping on my head at night. Help!,"I have 2 cats, both 5 months old and girls. One of them likes to chase the other and play aggressively. The other doesn't play aggressively and for the most part is mostly running away from the more aggressive one but in general they play wrestle and get along fine and sleep in the same bed and groom one another.

They seem to get along however the other cat is just more agressive and doesn't seem to be changing her behavior no matter how many toys we give them or how often we take them to the park. Only catnip seems to somewhat help the aggressive one calm down but i dont think i can give her cat nip her everyday or all the time.

In general they are good cats, they wear a harnesses and travel well. The problem is they like running across my face at night when I'm sleeping and my bedroom doesn't have a door to keep them from coming into my sleeping area at night (because I live in a studio) and as a result they are scratching me in the face, body slamming my face, and I end up waking up with headaches. 

I cut their nails regularly but they sharpen them and for some odd reason when they run across my face or any part of me they use their claws to run and they end up cutting me and injuring me in the night. They both do this.

Lately they have been jumping ONTO my face at night and somehow are scratching the ridge of my nose with their claws and it hurts like hell!

As you can imagine, having a 3 pound ball of meat hit me in the face every night more than once after getting a moderare concussion isnt good for my concussion recovery. Im actually worried they are giving me new concussions because its so easy to get new concussions after you just got one.

I don't know what to do! The only solution I have found is to put them in their kennel at night and I feel terrible doing that. Is there is an alternative? If there isnt an alternative I will kennel them bc I need to recover in order to be a good pet owner and have good quality of life and that is priority but man do I feel guilty kenneling them!

NOTE: No, I cannot install a door because I live in a studio that has only side walls, no middle walls which means there is no where to install a door. Also my landlord would not return my deposit if I made any changes to the studio like installing a long, large door.

Also, does anyone know WHY they do this? They are basically BODY SLAMMING my face and I DONT KNOW WHY. When I say body slam I mean it literally. They literally pick a spot on the bed near enough to my face and lunge at it full force and drop (I know this bc my Ring Camera captured it). Sometimes my face is covered with the blanket when they do this but other times it's not covered. The times when my face isn't covered they cut me on the ridge of my nose (a painful experience, especially painful in the morning).

  
Today, the aggressive one lunged at my face and body slammed the side of my face where I have my concussion injury. This happened around 6am. My eye hurts now and I have a headache. I really hope they didn't give me a new concussion!

Details: they are indoor cats. It's winter rn so I can't really take them to the park like I did during the summer but i still try and take them but they dont seem to enjoy it bc they are indoor cats. They play all day long indoors tho, so I don't think it's an exercise problem. They eat twice a day and actually might be a little over weight so lack of food isn't the issue. They have a lot of toys and a Cat tower they use. I dont play with them a lot because of my cincussion injury (im still trying to recover and take things slow). I do sometimes play with them using their cat toys. They have a large cat bed and I try and buy them decent food. Rn they are eating Purina One for kittens.",2024-01-15 06:45:50
Should I stop wearing headphones?,My cat and dog like to chill with me and my room. Do they like hearing the things I'm listening to? Just video games and YouTube videos.

My cat loves me but is a terror to everyone else,"My cat is 3 1/2 years old. I got her when she was 3 weeks and had just opened her eyes, I bottle fed her, and she became very attached to me and my parents. Sadly I wasn't able to get any of her siblings so she grew up as the only cat with a decent amount of human socialization (me, my parents, and friends I would have visit her as a kitten) as a baby she was plenty friendly but as she's gotten older she's gotten very moody.

I moved out and lived with a roommate who also had a cat, they hated each other at first (hissing swiping etc) but pretty fast became best friends, so I know she's capable of getting along with other cats, although she always kept my roommates at an arms length.



Here's the thing. Fast forward to now and the only people she likes are me and my boyfriend. She's obsessive with us (cuddly and sweet) and she will let my current roommates pet her but that's about it. However when we have guests over or when she meets anyone new, even if they are quiet and gentle she will hiss and swipe at them out of nowhere. Even if just seconds before she was rubbing up to them asking for pets. We have also had a few instances where she has gone completely feral over small things, like a loud noise from someone setting down their shoes or someone coming into my (her) room to use the bathroom. When she gets like this it's full hissing scratching chasing us around the house feral behavior and even I can't help the situation. Once she feels threatened she will even come after me, trying to kill me lol even if I'm calm and reassuring. At that point pretty much the only thing I can do is close her in a room and wait a few hours until she calms down. I understand cats can be moody and you need to be patient with them but the way she turns out of nowhere can just be scary. I just keep her in her room now whenever anyone is over and I'm afraid to even let her meet new people. I can never have anyone petsit because I feel like she might go feral on them and I just really don't know what to do at this point. Sometimes she's fine and in general as long as no one gets in her space she's standoffish at worst but I never really know when something is going to cross a line for her or when she's going to snap. :(( any advice would help

"Lost my cat on Christmas, can I still find him?","We lost our cat this Christmas and haven't found him since. We had guests over that day, and while cooking, preparing, and everything we didn't think to check. When we checked, around 2 PM when everyone was already sitting and eating, we could only find one of them but not the other. No one saw him leaving, it's like he'd vanished. We looked anywhere and everywhere in the house, the stairs, the garage, and the apartment below but couldn't find him. We looked in the areas nearby that afternoon, and the days after following the advice of looking for him in the early hours of the day or late hours of the night. Nothing. Talked to the veterinary, and he said cats have that instinct sometimes to go out and explore but usually come back in a few days because they know you feed them, so he found it unusual that he wasn't back yet.   
Talked to the lady of the animal volunteer association that takes care of strays in our town, and she said she would call if she saw him. Shared a post on FB about him, and we even had someone saying they saw him at the square, but when we went to check we didn't find him. A lady in the area said she feeds strays and that she would've seen him, so it probably wasn't him. I don't know. It's like he completely vanished. Even just seeing him and knowing the general direction he'd taken I'd feel better. I have the constant fear he's stuck somewhere and can't get out. I hope that he's ok.   
I think that he's either A. stuck/lost and can't return, B. doesn't want to return and living his best life on his own, or having joined a colony, C. someone found him and took him with them (he's very cute and sociable lol).  
Do you think I can still find him? What can I do? ",2024-01-13 22:09:17
"HomeAgain changed all of my pet ownership info, contact info, and even my dogs name for my dog's microchip, then says I was never on the account!"," My vet implanted and registered my dog with a HomeAgain microchip in 2017. This week when I called HomeAgain to try to locate my dog, HomeAgain repeatedly told me I was not the owner of the dog with that chip number, the name of the dog was different, and my contact info was not on the account and has never been on the account. HomeAgain repeatedly said another woman with different contact info and a different dog's name has been listed as the owner since 2017 and is the only owner that was ever on the account. My vet sent the chip number with my name, contact info, my dog's name, and the date the chip was implanted to HomeAgain, but HomeAgain continued to say my name and contact info have never been on this chip number. Then, I found a 2018 email from HomeAgain reminding me to renew ""\[my dog's name\]"" membership, under that exact microchip number. I forwarded it; HomeAgain hasn't responded to my email.

My cats fight to the point that we’re considering giving one up. Is there anything we can do?,"I have two male cats, a tabby named Lance and a black one named Seth. We got seth first when he was a kitten and he’s grown pretty big. We got Lance later when he was an adult already and got neutered a little later than usual. I don’t know what details are necessary, so I’m listing everything I can think of.

When we got Lance, he did bully Seth a little, but we ended it quickly once we realised that was the case. They were fine for a while, we’ve had them for years, but just a couple years ago, they started fighting really bad. Seth practically hunts him down whenever they’re in the same room and if you take him out, he goes right back. Lance is very clearly in a lot of distress, he stays high up to avoid Seth and if he wants to go from one surface to another, he checks around before rushing over so he can’t get attacked.

They’ve had two really bad fights as far as I know and from what I remember, the first one basically started all this. They apparently saw another cat out the window and it set them off. In the end, Lance got a scratch on his nose that left a scar. Just a few minutes ago, they had another fight and one of them, probably Lance got a scratch on his paw that drew blood. I don’t know details on that one, I don’t want to go downstairs.

I’m sure we’ve tried a few things, but the only one I can think of is mother cat pheromones. I can’t even tell if it’s worked. Is adopting one out simply the best option, or is there something else we can try?",2024-01-13 10:29:27
Me and my BF are going through a breakup; what is the best thing to do for our mutual pet cat?,"After almost 3 years of living together, he got me a kitten, as he knew I always wanted one. Even though he got her as a gift for me, it's still our mutual pet since we live together and both take care of her.

We've had her for a year now, and he has completely fallen in love with her. They are extremely close, and share a lot of little rituals, like bedtime pets and play time. I also have my own ways of bonding with her that are unique to me and her, but she is equally close with both of us.

It breaks my heart to think that one of us has to let her go. She is extremely intelligent and sensitive, and I can't imagine how much she would miss either one of us. Honestly, she is the hardest part about this breakup.

He and I are separating on good terms, it's a completely amicable breakup, and there are absolutely no hateful or bitter feelings involved. He insists that I get to keep her because she was meant as a gift for me, and if that's the case, I am completely open and okay with the idea that he still gets to spend time with her sometimes, at least for a while after the breakup so that she can get used to the idea of seeing him less often.

But I'm not sure if this would be good for her? I don't know how pets respond in these situations, so I would really appreciate some advice on what would be the best case scenario for her, and what is the healthiest way to handle this type of situation.",2024-01-13 08:37:34

How to feed your cat/dog with chronic renal failure… A guide for when all else failed.,"Hello everyone... I want to share my story and experiences, in case there is someone desperate out there, like I was months ago, frantically searching for any tips and knowledge regarding how to feed their cat or dog suffering from renal failure… that just won’t eat ANYTHING AT ALL.   
  
Why am I writing this: My dog is 13 years old.  In May 2023 she was diagnosed with late-stage chronic renal failure, chronic pancreatitis. and inoperable sarcoma. She completely lost her appetite. We were told she has about 3-4 months left to live. It’s been 9 months now, and she is still with us, in good condition. Happy, loving her daily walks.  
  
Our veterinarians attribute this mainly to how we manage to (miraculously) keep her eating, despite her not responding well to any appetite stimulants.   
  
So, to sum up: After the diagnosis we were desperate. I tried searching for inspiration everywhere and found little help that did not rely on using appetite stimulant meds. And so, we decided to try EVERYTHING we could possibly think of to get our dog to eat ANYTHING. In the process, we discovered that even the tiniest detail can help a LOT. So here’s the list of things we find impact our dog’s attitude towards a meal:  

  
**1. The consistency of a meal (especially meat and fish) matters:**  
\-	MINCED and rolled into balls big or small.

\-	CUT into chunks, big or small, strips thin or thick.

\-	BLENDED into a pulp.  
Example: sometimes a food divided into bigfer parts is accepted, while mashed with a fork is shunned (or the other way around).    


**2. How meat/fish is cooked**: RAW (if the type of protein allows it), BOILED, BAKED, FRIED.    
Example: sometimes our dog shuns raw beef for weeks, but absolutely loves little fried homemade beef hamburgers ;)   



**3. Each meat subtype is a different case.**
Level of acceptance of different „parts” of meat can be different. For example, if a chicken breast fails to attract your pet’s attention, try a thigh or a liver. :) This especially worked for us for poultry.  



**4. Using spices**, even a little bit, can help stimulate the appetite a LOT (just make sure the spices are not toxic).   
Example: once we changed our frying oil from sunflower to canola and it greatly helped in inducing appetite.  
  
**5. How the food is SERVED (we had great success with that!)**  
\-	Bowl

\-	Plate (big or small!)

\-	From your hand 

\-	From a tip of the finger

\-	From plastic containers and/or their lids    
But also some more creative ways:

\-	Placed in those small spaces in a dog puzzle toy (we had GREAT success with that)

\-	Placed inside a Kong

\-	Placed inside a snack ball (if it’s dry and/or kibble)

\-	Placed inside a small container placed upside down (so the dog has to paw at it to turn it upside down)
 \-	The “accidental drop” from the kitchen counter (so our dog thought she snatched it, while I was  cooking ;))
 \-	The “I pretend I am eating my pet’s food and sharing my meal with them”.   


**6. TEMPERATURE.** Serving warm sometimes makes a huge difference. I found this especially significant with canned foods.   
  
**7. COAXING.** 
Sometimes what ultimately helps is rubbing some food on the inside of the mouth a few times – when they get a “taste”, this might help stimulate what is left of their appetite…   
    
And lastly, three general observations: 
**1. TASTES CHANGE. ALL THE TIME.** What is considered OK during breakfast can become “inedible” for lunch and vice-versa. This can change as often as every meal, or as rarely as every other week. What becomes “inedible” can sometimes go back to a “favourites” list (but this usually takes WEEKS…)  

  
**2. Remember that ANY food is better than no food at all.** So when your pet declines all renal-appropriate diets, you can still keep improvising for a time to feed them what they are most likely to eat. Yes, their preferences will vary over time (see point above), and no, it will all rarely be optimal for kidney failure… But in the end, it’s all about improving quality of life, for as long as you are together.   

  
**3. CAT vs DOG food.** Sometimes a dog might be more willing to give cat foods a go. Fun fact: Sometimes a cat version of a dried/canned food is accepted, even if its dog version is currently on the “no go” list.   
  
If I ever discover anything more, I will update this thread. :)  
  
I hope someone, someday reads this and finds it helpful... And if you do, I wish you and your furry friend many happy days together. Best of luck on your journey. ❤️

Has anyone rehomed their pets after having children and why?,"Little context and backstory to my question:

My cousins growing up were notorious for having pets and rehoming them right away. They never had any pets pass from old age. *Something* always happened and the pet had to go away. 

One cousin in particular had gotten 2 dachshunds and after she had her first baby she got rid of them. My grandmother said it was “too much” for my cousin. My cousin said getting up to walk the dogs and go downstairs with them was a hassle. (She lived a few floors up in an apartment).

 I feel like she shouldn’t have anymore pets after that, since upkeeping the dog’s care was the reason she got rid of them. But she got a sphinx cat. 

Personally I feel getting a pet is a lifetime commitment. I’m planning to have a baby soon with my own partner and I never have thought about getting rid of my 2 dogs and cat. All of which are now double digit seniors and I’ve had them since I was a teenager. I know they need to go outside and be walked (I also live in an apartment like my cousin) but I don’t see it as such a burden.

In my mind I figure I would strap baby to my chest and walk the dogs. I feel like I’d make it work no matter what. 

Besides aggression or health reasons, I don’t see why you’d rehome a pet because of a baby. 

I feel like if you can’t handle a child and a pet, you shouldn’t be getting more after getting rid of your past ones. 

Idk I just feel bad for those dogs. I feel like all my cousins treat them as disposable and don’t truly bond with their animals.",2024-01-12 11:56:38
Should I be concerned that my grandma's cat just drank for 12 minutes straight?,"I made a post awhile back about how my grandma's cat, Payton, would drink from my dogs' water bowl and leave it dirty from crumbs, dirt, and cat hair. Which, I found that his fur is actually really dirty and he needs a bath (my grandma has never given him one cause she thinks he washes himself). Oh and please don't comment on this part, it's just to explain the situation with him. I'll take care of his fur. 

Anyway, someone told me he likely just wants a bowl to drink from that's not near his food. I found one of my dog's old bowls earlier so I filled it with water and placed it close to my door. Payton immediately took to it! But then he drank from it, chin in the bowl, while looking around the room for 12 minutes. He does use the litter box a lot but not as much as he did two months ago. 

As much as this cat drives me crazy, I have grown to care about him. He's about 10 or 11 years old. And he's my grandma's cat so I can't do anything too extreme to him without her permission.

Update: It's not a good update. I got yelled at for reaching out to my aunt about my concerns with my grandma's cat. My grandma said she called her vet. Turns out, he was taken 6 months ago and had ""perfect bloodwork so there's nothing wrong with him"". Then I got yelled at for worrying about Payton in the first place because my grandma has had him for 11 years so she knows her cat and would know if something is wrong with him. She wants me to pick him up and take him to his water bowl (which is plastic) every time he tries to drink the dog's water bowl. But I have severe joint pain and he does it so often that I'd be going to bed in severe pain every night so I'm gonna leave the extra water bowl in my room for him. He doesn't have any toys either besides one feather toy that's a scratch post. He's also stopped using his cat tree (no joke, my dog Eevee uses it more). I think he's depressed and because of her old age, my grandma has no idea. And she won't listen to anything I have to say because she's older and she's had him for 11 years so she knows him. 

She will let him see the vet that comes here, though. She didn't even say thank you for my concern or anything. Just said it isn't my business in the first place. 

She also apparently no longer trusts me because I was concerned about her cat and talked to my aunt about it. She even made me open my mail in front of her. No good deed goes unpunished, huh? ",2024-01-12 05:59:30
When I have to drop my bunny off at the vet I'm scared he thinks I'm leaving him there forever,"I have a specific fear related to my rabbits. Yesterda my rabbit had an eye procedure to help with his glaucoma. He needed to be sedated so I had to drop him off before work and pick him up after. When I left I was so upset because I was thinking ""what if he thinks I don't love him anymore bc he's old and not feeling well, and he thinks im abandoning him here so I don't have to deal with him anymore""

I remember having the exact same thought when I dropped my previous rabbit off for a dental procedure.

I can't tell if I'm projecting bc my mom abandoned me with my grandparents who ended up raising me, or if this is a for real worry. 

Does anyone else worry that their pets will think that when they go to the vet?

Btw my bunny is fine and his eye is already looking better.",2024-01-12 03:22:06
Family member wants to leave their pet cat alone while they go on vacation for a month AGAIN,"I made a post about this exact same thing last year. The same family member is on their way to Florida for a whole month and expects the rest of the family to drop their lives and be responsible for the cat. Usually this wouldn’t be an issue, but they have failed to check in with us if we are free. My boyfriend and I are about to leave for small vacation and then we go on vacation again in a couple weeks. 
The solution last year was for them to pay another family member to stay and cat sit which worked out great. This year, though they don’t want to pay for any sort of cat sitting. They said we should pay, but we don’t have the money on top of our other expenses to suddenly pay for a month of pet sitting.
We can’t take her in because we already have a cat of our own, and this cat doesn’t get along well with other cats. We are at our wit’s end we can’t have the same situation happen year after year so we are considering possibly having to rehome the cat. 
The owner of the cat absolutely refuses to understand why this is bad for their cat and refuses to pay for any form of cat sitting or boarding. I hate the idea of rehoming, especially after having a pet for so many years, but I don’t know what to do anymore. Please any advice on how to handle the situation. I don’t know what to do.",2024-01-12 02:59:48
Does your pet understand when you do things for them?,"I have a cat Ive been sitting for the last 6 months.
She's amazing, a 2 year old tuxedo who loves to cuddle and play.

Anyway, a week ago she heard a cat outside of my bedroom window and has been obsessed with the window since then.

I have a bay window with one of those rainbow prism decals, so she could never fully look outside...she just sees blobs. Obviously when there was a stray outside, she knew and she stared intently through the decal, shooting daggers with her eyes.
She's been sitting at the window everyday since then.

Tonight, while she was sitting on the table looking out, I cleared everything off to give her more room (she watched me curiously, sniffing and whatnot) and I removed a piece of the decal so she can clearly see outside. She's been GLUED to the window now. 

Its a silly question, but does she understand that I cleared that space for her? I know she's very happy with the change, but my brain is just going lol",2024-01-11 14:16:58
"My 9 month old cat got neutered a couple of days ago and since his surgery, he’s been panic eating. Anyone else seen this in their pets?","I want to believe that the reason may be because of the instructions of not feeding him past midnight before surgery and him going almost 24 hours without a meal, but this is like… bad. 

Before surgery, he did get excited about feeding time. Now, he’s literally trying to claw his way up my body to get to the food in my hand. He’s even been bullying his big sister for her portion. I’ve had to now feed them separately. Will this die down eventually? 

I also have cat tax if need be.

Heartbroken Furry MaMa,"When I got home from work 2 nights ago, my cat Cody, who was about nine years old suddenly passed away. She was not sick. She was happy, healthy, and playful. As I was making dinner and after feeding the cats, Cody was happy her happy self. She was involved in scratching at the chair as she usually did. When my son came downstairs, he picked her up and within seconds he was screaming “What the hell is going on” and brought Cody into the kitchen hysterically. When I first saw her, I thought she was having a seizure, so I began to rub her back and try to just make her comfortable. Seconds later she was foaming at the mouth, lymph and lifeless. I wrapped her in a blanket and rushed her down the street to the animal hospital where I live. I tried to give her some CPR but I knew it was not working. I was frantic and I charged into the animal hospital. They could not save her. The doctor told me that she most likely had suffered heart failure, or had a blood clot that went to her heart. I have been up for two nights now trying to understand what happened to her. Could it be possible that she was so into scratching the chair that when my son picked her up she got so scared that she had a heart attack?",2024-01-11 06:25:38

Guinea pig won’t eat unless I’m in the room,"My guinea pig is about 2 and a half years old. I give him the correct amount of kibble and veggies everyday along with a supply of hay. For the past few days I noticed that when I give him veggies and leave the room, he will sit in his house and won’t touch it. But as soon as I walk in he will start eating. I tried it again as well, I left the room and came back and sure enough he went right back to his house and didn’t eat, and again he saw me and then started eating. As I sit here now typing this he has finished all his food and is “talking” to me and he seems happy. I don’t think he is sick, but I want to know what kind of behavior this is, is it because he is attached? Is he scared? Or does this require a trip to a vet?

I should clarify this, he will not tolerate any other pig, he doesn’t have an ear because at the shelter he got into a fight, he was smaller than most guinea pigs (I’m only assuming this is why he is like this). The shelter said they had to separate them and since they did he loved being around people. The shelter did have an adopt-two rule on the guinea pigs, birds, and even some of the cats. But Jack (his name) was an exception there. I asked why and they simply said that he cannot be with other pigs. Well long story short I adopted him and later on I got him a friend. Worst mistake of my life. Kept them for a month and Jack was not eating, not playing, and would NOT get close to this pig. I even tried feeding them together and he would not budge. I thought maybe it would improve but it certainly did not, and the friend we got him was getting depressed not having a lively guinea pig around. So after a month we gave the friend to my sister who has 3 guinea pigs, and we kept Jack at my house and he’s been super happy since. Loves the attention from people. Not scared of anyone. I would love to get him a friend but that just simply can’t happen.",2024-01-10 10:33:01

Low maintenance first pet?,My son is Turning 11 and has been asking for a pet for years . I think he is mature enough but I’m trying to figure out a low maintenance pet. We spend a lot of time at home and would be giving it love and attention I just don’t want to take on responsibility that I’d be stressed about . Definitely not a dog . Hamsters too small stressful . I was thinking bird ? Not sure what kind or possibly a cat . I grew up with tons of different pets but never had one for my kids . I get anxious worrying we won’t be able to give it the best life or worrying about it getting hurt . I also remember how heartbroken I was anytime a pet would die . Anyways any suggestions would be great ! Thanks,2024-01-10 00:28:50
Was our dog abused?,"Over the weekend, our dog stayed over at a ""dog lodge"" for boarding. When we went to pick him up, a small patch of his fur was missing near his paw, and there seemed to be missing skin (similar to a burn mark). When we got home, his personality was also completely different. On a typical day, he'll have the zoomies, always grab his leash so I can walk him, and steal our socks to make us chase him around. However, today, he seemed very depressed– he basically laid down all day and didn't even want to go on a walk. His expression also seemed sad, if that makes any sense. He was a completely different dog.  
We asked the front desk what happened to our dog, but all she said was that'd she give us a call later in the day after she found out. We never heard from her.  
We've dropped him off at this place before for lodging and daycare, and every time we pick him up, he's as happy as he can be. No signs of abuse or anxiety were ever shown before. Everyone there basically knows my dog because he went to daycare a lot when it was warmer out and he also gets groomed there. I've even volunteered a couple of times during my spare time, and my dog always looks so happy.  
I guess that's why I can't wrap around the idea that he was possibly abused there, and I want second opinions. I'm calling the veterinarian tomorrow as well so they can treat his wound.",2024-01-09 13:12:17

Please get your pet neutered/spayed.,"There is like 100,000 puppies and kittens on the street, with no home. That’s either because:

1. The owner didn’t neuter/spay their pet, and now they abandoned them.

2. The owner was a bad care-taker, and didn’t know that much about getting a pet.


You see? The world is already overpopulated with animals, we don’t need more puppies and kittens homeless on the street. There was this comment on yt video that said “I love my dog, I’m never getting her neutered/ spayed.” 


What the heck.


Just because you love your dog doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get it neutered: spayed. Your dog will have a higher chance of mammary cancer, spraying, heat, etc. I think that person needs to do WAY MORE research. As a matter of fact, a lot of people were agreeing with her. I think they shouldn’t have gotten a pet, if they think neutering/ spaying your pet is bad. I am not a vet, I’m just saying to please, or at least try to neuter/ spay your pet.",2024-01-08 04:42:33
"Vet made a mistake and placed the decimal in the wrong place when calculating the amount of sedative my puppy needed, almost killing him. What would you do??","My puppy, 5 months old, has been at the vet for an emergency visit for the last 3 days. They’ve been giving him fluids and meds through an IV and doing tests trying to figure out what’s wrong with him as he hasn’t held food or water down for days, has been throwing up and having diarrhea and hasn’t been his normal peppy self. They called today and recommended an exploratory surgery as they have a feeling there may be a blockage somewhere that is not showing up on any of their X-rays. We agreed.. asked if we could come see him first and was told yes even though we are a 50 minute drive away. Got a phone call not even 15 minutes after leaving the house saying they want to get him in surgery now and it would be best if we waiting until after to see him. (Keep in mind this was the end of their day, I’m sure they all wanted to get in an out and go home as fast as possible) so they took him for surgery and I got another phone call explaining to me that someone had made a mistake when calculating how much sedative he would need and gave him a lethal dose (he’s ok) that dropped his heart rate and almost killed him. They reversed the drug and woke him up THANK GOD. when I asked what happened and HOW it happened, they told me someone had put the decimal in the wrong spot (example: if it was suppose to be .05 they accidentally put .5) I don’t know the exact amount or how big the error was, just that it happened. They gave excuses such as they’ve been very busy and it somehow got overlooked.. They apologized and offered a free overnight stay for him and 25% off our vet bill as well as told me the manager is already aware and I am able talk to her this week when she’s in the office if I’d like and he still has to go back in to have the surgery done tomorrow. I will be requesting his entire medical record including a detailed report of the incident when all is done but I don’t know what else to do. 

Should I let it go and be happy the drug was reversible? Do I report it? 

I’ve taken him home for the night as I’m not comfortable leaving him there after this incident especially considering there’s no staff overnight. I’m so nervous to allow them to attempt to operate on him again as this doesn’t seem like a small error to me.


*UPDATE*

Went to his surgery appointment today to be told now this new doctor doesn’t think surgery is necessary. As he has a *feeling* they won’t find anything. 

The doctor yesterday also had a *feeling* they would and was very adamant about having the surgery done. 

They sent him home with me to monitor him and if he is throwing up or having diarrhea tonight then they will do it tomorrow?????

WHAT DO I DO. I feel like this is a joke now.


**** UPDATE #2 ****

Took him in to his scheduled surgery today.. had a quick conversation about how his night went at home. No vomit, small amounts of diarrhea. Held some food down. 

New surgical team today, they now say they don’t want to operate as they have a *feeling* they won’t find anything. Yesterday’s staff was so adamant on getting him in quickly.. so quickly that they skipped protocol steps. Today’s staff doesn’t feel the need to operate and has sent him home to be monitored by me and reevaluate tomorrow. 

I also found out today that the 25% off only applied to the costs of the surgery.. which didn’t even end up happening. So essentially all I have received from them is an “oops sorry won’t happen again” 🤷🏻‍♀️

Getting your pet neutered and spayed is a good thing.,"The breeds are overpopulated, and there will be homeless puppies and kittens on the street. I saw a yt video of a cute doggo getting spayed, and ppl in the comment section were going wild. One girl said that she would never do that to her pet BECUASE she loves it. Well, just because you love it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get it neutered and spayed. If they’re thinking that I recommend they do more research. Please, please get your pet neutered and spayed. I am not a pet expert, but I recommend you do more research or go to a vet if you have any questions or concerns.",2024-01-07 07:55:59
Feeling like I made a huge mistake adopting my cat. Need advice.,"Hi everyone. I VERY recently adopted an adorable adult cat from a shelter. I've wanted a cat for a while, did all my research, got all my supplies, and finally bit the bullet and adopted a cat. I was so excited as I live alone in a small 1 bedroom apartment so I expected it to be nice to have a companion around.

I won't lie and say it hasn't been nice. The cat adjusted to the apartment very easily and was very confident. Already knows to use the litterbox, where his food bowls are, etc. The 2 main issues I have are he likes to try to scratch doorways, and he likes to keep me up at night.

But my feelings and regrets aren't really coming from the cat or his behavior. I love petting him, and just hanging out. Right now as I'm typing this he's just chilling in my lap. It's more my personal issues that I either should've considered more before adopting, or didn't realize would be a problem. These last few days, I just feel like I made a huge mistake and this cat should be in a much better home. I'm currently off work due to winter break (I work at a university), and I don't go back to work until monday which has left me a lot of time to dwell on these feelings.

The first main issue is anxiety of leaving him home. So far, i've only left him home for about an hour at a time, but on monday he will be home for 6 whole hours. I live in a rented space and really don't want to come home to a destroyed apartment. He seems to entertain himself fine the times I did leave him alone, but idk about when it's for an extended period of time like a day at work.

My other problem is I just feel overstimulated. He's been very clingy which overall I think is fine. He's likely grateful he has a warm comfortable home. But as someone who has lived alone in a single bedroom apartment for the last 3 years, I can't help but feel like I lost basically all my personal space just because of how small my apartment is. And I can't really block him off to a single room without denying him access to an area, or cutting off an area I need to use.

My final issue is finances. I do have enough money to cover the expenses for the cat. But my worry is being overwhelmed with something before I'm prepared. Even just this first upcoming vet visit, because of obtaining all the supplies, I have to be very careful with my overall spending just to make sure I have enough to cover this initial visit, and then while I'm saving an emergency fund, what if something bad happens before it's fully ready, or it's more than I saved up for. I'm a recent college grad who works 50 hours a week to support myself.

I know this turned into a little bit of a vent post, but I just don't know what to do. I thought I gave everything a good deal of thought, but the more I look into it I feel like I did a horrible thing, and I feel like a horrible selfish person for taking in this cat, and now considering bringing it back. I'd like for things to work, like I said he's currently just chilling in my lap and I enjoy his company. I would NEVER neglect or mistreat a cat, but I'm not sure if over time I'll be able to provide the proper attention he might need. A lot of what I read has said to be patient and wait a while for the ""kitty blues"" to pass, but my worry is I'll wait too long, see that it isn't for me, and then I have to remove a cat that fully adapted to his new environment and bonded with his new owner.

It's all been a big strain on my mental health, so just some kind words or some advice, maybe similar stories might help. Thank you.

EDIT: Also forgot to mention I'll be moving in about 5 months. Not anywhere far, just to another area of town.",2024-01-06 10:08:18
Am i wrong for not letting my mom give the kitten i rescued to a poor family?,"I rescued a kitten around a month ago and he has already been to 2 houses and they returned him now my neighbors asked my mom if they could adopt him and my mom said but i immediately said no coz they are really poor. Their father earns 30k a month and is a family of 3(including parents)  it is really low knowing that we a family a 6 have a combined income of more than 200k and still aren't that  financially stable. My mom said if they are poor cant they adopt a cat cant they play with him i get that they want him but it isn't that kitten's fault that they are poor they wont even be able to afford his food let alone vet bills. Am i wrong for this?

Note: A packet of cat food from a cheap but trustable brand ""Mera"" costs 2.5k per 1.5 kilograms and the chicken price fluctuates between 500 and 700 hundred. And a vet consultation costs 1k just consultation not medicines or treatment

Edit: I mean 30k pkr not 30k $

Plastic dog food container absorbing fats from the food?,"I have a vittles vault dog food container just like this

"Kitten post-adoption regret... Anxious to the point of sick, I don't know what to do.","It's been about 3 days since I've adopted this adorable kitten. And I've gotten myself anxious to the point of not eating and being sick. I feel so awful about it because I love cats, and I watch videos and read about cat behaviour constantly. I knew for about 5 years that I wanted to have one of my own and waited until I got this 2 bedroom flat that I'm in now.  I grew up with an amazing Maine Coon, who's alive and I get to see her often, and I think that's the problem.

I feel like I'm grieving about 2 things, which are my independence and my family cat. I love my family cat to pieces, I groomed and fed her often when I lived there. She has a very distinct personality and a big 5 bed house with a cat-proofed garden she has access to during the day. And every time I look at my kitten or notice him doing something I compare him to my family cat. I'm constantly comparing, and since he's a kitten, I'm aware of his existence in the flat 24/7. Even his cuteness isn't doing anything for me and I feel sick to my stomach, like I've made the wrong decision. 

I don't really know how to cope with this. everyone around me is saying it'll pass, and my partner knows that I usually have a problem with change and saying goodbye to something. I'm eager to hear advice from you guys and if anyone has experienced similar. ",2024-01-05 01:09:58
"Roommate in jail, left me with a cat","I am in NE Georgia, USA and a cat has come into my care from a roommate with alcohol problems who got arrested for battery. I am conflicted about whether to care for the cat until the roommate can reclaim him, seek adoption, or seek a foster arrangement. He loved his cat, took decent care of the cat, never hurt him, and the cat loves him. They cuddled together a lot and this cat brought light into his life. I do not want to separate them.

The roommate in question has provided good care to the cat in spite of his issues because he was employed at the time. But he has often been resistant to seeking employment, has spent parts of his life homeless/vagrant, and at one point he was even a drug addict but got clean. He had anger issues but only towards me, never towards any animal including his friend's dog or wildlife. I do not foresee an end to his drinking but I do not think that specific problem interfered with his love and care towards the cat. It's the habitual unemployment I am worried about.

I am doing my best to make sure the cat is fed on time and the litter box is kept scooped, changed, and cleaned, and give this sweet animal company and affection, but I struggle with mental illness and cannot even take care of myself at times so I am dreading my eventual collapse. I am not really a pet person either (sorry I'm just not). I see him as a responsibility I must uphold the best I can, but he will likely get attached to me. I cannot drive and thus do not have reliable transportation. There's a vet a few minutes' walk away but I don't know what I'd do in an emergency. I could ask them when I visit if they'll pick him up in an emergency. Also I would be broken by large vet bills later in his life, though I am able to afford basic supplies for now and got him a fountain + some other small things.

There's a flea season in my state and I'm pretty sure the roommate left the cat here with fleas. I live in an apartment so I had no idea how they got in, but I guess they were teeming in spring. He had fleas months ago and the roommate gave him medicine so either they came back or have been on him all along. That is a big concern. I have flea medicine but not a vacuum. I bought a Seresto collar and will make sure to keep an eye on him for any irritation or issues. Will the collar gradually kill off the carpet fleas or do I need a vacuum regardless? He is very active so they must be everywhere. He scratches himself and chews while he grooms, and I want him to be happy not itchy.

I want advice on what to do with this cat at such a time when I become legally able to make decisions about the cat. Ideally I want to find a foster home who will contractually return the cat to the roommate on condition that he has found employment and a home, but I don't know if such a solution exists or can be reached. If he is sentenced to prison it will probably be a year at most. For the time being I will continue to take care of the cat as I await more news, and as I wait for the stressful situation I have been placed in to calm down a bit, but I want ideas.

  
Update: He was let out of county jail about a week in, later he was given a deadline to pick up the cat and his stuff, and then an extension. He showed up a day after the end of the deadline extension with a couple friends and picked up his cat and most of his stuff.

Considering rehoming our cats and very torn,"I just want to start out by saying that this is the very last thing I want to do and I think I need some other perspectives. It's also quite long so if no one reads this, that's okay. Maybe venting is enough. 

A bit of background: we're a family of five. My husband is chronically I'll and, because of his condition, has developed the inability to deal with situations he finds stressful in productive ways. He's also incredibly selfish and only ever considers himself (different issue for another time/place and which I'm dealing with). We have three girls ages 9, 7 and 5. 

In April of last year, my husband decided it would be a good idea with get a cat for the girls. They'd been asking for a pet and they're all old enough to help out looking after the cat. We ended up adoptong two male kittens from the same litter. Up until recently, it's been a good experience for the girls, especially my 7 yr old. One of the kittens has bonded with her and they're like best friends. 

Here are the issues: my husband complains daily about the cats. They track litter everywhere and he seems to have developed a sensory issue where he absolutely cannot stand the feeling of it on his feet. He thinks he's smelling the litter boxes constantly when they're actually kept very clean and I've found a litter that is the best one yet for smell.  This could be related to his illness (it's has a cognitive component). They've ruined his computer chair from scratching (mine as well). They keep us up at night with their play fighting and zooming around the house. They're constantly on the kitchen counters. Oh, and they're always stealing his cables and small objects that he refuses to put away because he thinks he ""shouldn't have to."" 

My issue is, his constant complaining and anger towards the cats is becoming more and more difficult to put up with. I've been standing my ground for my girls because they love their cats and they'll be heartbroken if we re-home them. I feel it's not teaching them proper pet ownership to re-home them over issues that can, mostly, be resolved but over which their father is selfishly refusing to make adjustments for. 

Would you re-home a pet because of one person in the family making life difficult over the pet, knowing full well how upset and heartbroken your child would be? I don't know if I can bring myself to do that to her.",2024-01-04 10:57:26
When your pet is sleeping and twitches do you ever gently call their name in case it's a bad dream so you can appear in their dream and comfort them?,"When your pet is clearly dreaming and you don't wanna wake them, but are worried their dream might be bad do you gently call their name so you can show up in their dream and save them from whatevers scaring them ?",2024-01-03 21:59:09
I took my neighbor's cat,"I moved into a new apartment about 6 months ago and shortly afterward,  a little blonde kitty started visiting me. She looked very young,  maybe just old enough to be weaned.  I walked around with her a bit trying to find the owner and someone let me know who she belonged to. I returned her. 

A few days later,  the kitten was back.  I tried bringing her back,  but no one answered the door.  I then tried the neighbor that told me who the owners were,  and they took the kitten and said they would return her when the neighbors got home. They also informed me that the kitty was an indoor- outdoor cat now. 

Over the next couple months, this routine repeated itself. Kitten would come to see me,  I would return her. I eventually started keeping her overnight if the weather was crappy. I would feed her and she'd immediately pass out next to me on the couch. She made herself at home. 

One time, I had her for three nights before my neighbors texted me to let me know the owners were looking for her. The next morning, I cop-knocked on their door at 6am and said,  ""look, I found your cat!"" 

I didn't see the kitty for a few weeks after, so I thought they were finally taking care of her. Two weeks ago,  she showed up on my porch,  absolutely filthy, covered in fleas, had ear mites and had cuts and sores on her head. I gave her a bath and flea treatment,  gave her meds for ear mites and just gave her love. She starts purring as soon as I pick her up. 

I'm never giving this cat back.",2024-01-03 12:12:55
Quick reminder: sometimes is better to ignore the advice of other pet owners. Why are they sometimes so dramatic?,"I just took in a 4/5 yo cat from the streets and I did a lot, a lot of research. I asked a lot of questions on reddit and honestly I think some pet owners are very drastic and live in a bubble...This cat lived on the streets and people told me that I shouldn't have a pet if I can t afford the best food for example. I can only afford medium food. Sorry I'm not rich. I live in a country where pets in need are at every corner.  I think she's doing just fine... Stray cats/dogs here need the bare minimum and it is better than being killed or left on the streets. But I am a monster that I can only afford medium care , as if I beat her to death...

All this reddit questions caused so, so much anxiety. I felt like a horrible person because I can't guarantee that she will stay with me forever...maybe my life plans change, financial, maybe she acts out and needs someone 24/7 at home, idk. I cried and thought of giving her back to the woman who found her on the streets. I had a pannic attack from the pressure that I put on myself by reading every advice. 

So this is a reminder: sometimes you just have to ignore this people who act as if you're a millionaire and refuse to give the best of the best for your pets. I will give her love, food, water, plenty of toys, walk on special leashes. If our lifestyle won't match at some point or if rehoming would be better for her, I would do it. Some people will explode when hearing this, I know.

I made this post just to take the weight of selfcriticism from my shoulders. I will try my best with my student salary and pray it will work out for as much time as I can. Some people act as if I am torturing this cat...It's 1 homeless cat less in the world.",2024-01-03 07:22:38
Update: I stole a cat,"Some of you remember I took my neighbors cat in out of the cold and was debating what I should do. There have been developments.

The next morning I texted them and told them I took their cat in out of the cold. I did not receive a response for 5 days. Cut to Christmas Eve

Cat throws up a lot and threw up the day before. I see some pink in its throw up and realize I have to take it to the emergency vet. I am stressed and let it slip it's not my cat. I then have to eat crow and ask the owners permission to treat the cat and I'll pay for it. They get mad. I cry. Cats fine and probably isn't adjusting well to new (real) food. I return the cat under their request. Preserving every aspect of my identity in the process. 

Another week goes by. I get told by my other neighbor 2 things. 1: they left it on their non-climate controlled patio the entire time. Luckily it was high 40° F for the week. 2: The first day it's below freezing (NYE) they let it back out in the cold. I get word from my neighbor that the cat sounds like it's in heat and 3 cats are having a mating party under her deck. I went back out there with my carrier and she ran right up to me and I picked her up and put her in the cage. She's now back in my house.

I gave them a shot, but otherwise our neighborhood will be overrun with cats out in the freezing cold.",2024-01-02 14:26:33
Dog attacked me and put me in the hospital. Now he won't stop crying when I put him in the cage at night.,"I have a poodle named Ralph. He was a rescue that needed surgery after getting run over by a U-Haul truck. Along his devasting journey, he somehow found a way into my home. At first, things were chill, he pooped on the grass and refused to eat his military kibble, but never really caused me any major issues until last week when he jumped up and attacked me. I was putting his leash on him, and he kept on growling, biting and chewing on the leash so i yanked it out of his mouth, nudging his head to the side but when i bent down to readjust the leash he jumped, bit my ear and clawwed me. I couldn't fight back, I was utterly defenseless...anyways I ended up leaving the hospital with half my ear chewed off and an unnecessary medical bill. Now ever since then, I don't feel safe around him. I put him in his cage at night when I'm most vulnerable, as knowing he's locked up is the only thing that calms my nerves, but he just screams and cries, barks, wakes up the whole entire apartment complex and then sum. I just can't do this anymore. I haven't slept in days, I'm so terrified of him. Every time I look at him I fear he's going to eat me. ",2024-01-02 05:53:18

Should I euthanize my cat that suffers from kidney failure?,"My cat was diagnosed a week ago with kidney failure. she deteriorated quite fast.
 She has been in treatment ever since but sadly her lab results keep looking worse daily. 
She suffers from severe anemia and had to get a blood transfusion which ended up not helping like it should and the next day it started becoming severe again.
 Her creatinine is 7.6 and it keeps getting higher.
Her vets aren’t very hopeful and have sadly told me that even if we can get her to a stable condition (which is unlikely) her kidney function is very low and she will end up deteriorating shortly after.
 
But what’s making this decision more difficult is that she still has a bit of energy even though she’s extremely sick. Yesterday for example she ate (a tiny bit) and drank and walked a bit around the house and at night she kept meowing for me to get her in my bed and hold her (she didn’t sleep she kept her eyes open but she did relax a bit). 

About 5 months ago my other cat got diagnosed with FIP and they recommended euthanasia for her and she was looking quite literally half dead and by some miracle she got better and is now happy and alive.
 So it’s so difficult to make this decision to euthanize when my other cat had looked so much worse a few months ago and she overcame her illness.

I’m happy to hear your thoughts on this? What do you think I should do? 
**ps: there isn’t an option for a transplant sadly.

EDIT: I am so very thankful for each one of you who took the time to share their experiences and kind words. I’m trying my best to respond and thank everyone individually but it’s a lot of people so if I didn’t reply to your comment know that I read it and it helped a lot and I’m very thankful❤️",2024-01-01 18:42:10
AITA for stepping on my roommate's cat?,"This has happened at least twice already. I was rushing trying to get ready for bed, stepped out of the bathroom and into the dark hallway... and on his toes (couldn't see him, he's a black cat). He has this REALLY annoying habit of walking in front of me reallllly slowly in the hallway as well... and I try very hard not to step on him, but it's happened.

He didn't yelp or anything, just meowed, but I still felt like an AH. I also don't know how to correct this behavior. Not only is it annoying as all get out (and I'm legitimately worried I'll be late for work one of these days because of this), but it's just dangerous for him. It's also almost every morning and night (slightly less lately). Any advice? I'm not a cat person, are cats generally this annoying?",2024-01-01 06:58:16
Puppy,"I (F) 47 live in NYS my ex (m) bf 36 asked me if I could keep his new puppy for awhile! He has since left the puppy 11 weeks at my house for 3 weeks now. I asked him for money for food for her Kali is the (F) puppies name. He told me he didn’t have it! I have been paying for her food, puppy pads, first series of shots, training treats, medicine for her back due to a allergic reaction to a food she was originally on. He had told me multiple times 

“ every time he gets mad at me that we aren’t getting back together” 

That he’s coming to get the puppy or going to send his friend to pick her up! He still has no place where he can have the puppy! 

I did tell him last Sunday, through txt to be here to pick up his things and the puppy by Tuesday. He sent his friend to pick up his clothes! I still have the puppy! 

My kids and I are now so attached to this (baby) PUPPY! As she is to us!

I took in the most fearful puppy I’ve ever met… any advice on how I can help her?,"Christmas Eve, some ignorant people posted on our local Nextdoor page “I’m donating this cute puppy, feel free to come take her” along with their home address. Bad things happen to pets posted for free, especially in our area. Still raw from losing my 18 year old best buddy just days before, I went and got her. I haven’t had a puppy in a while, but this puppy seems abnormally fearful. I took her in thinking I’d foster and adopt her out, I’ve been in rescue in various capacities for 20+ years, but at 3.5 months old this puppy is scared to death of all people except for me, including my boyfriend who is usually every dog’s favorite. She hates being outside, trembles and hides her face around new people… she’s had a really scary week for sure, with a new home and new people, new dogs, but it just seems like a lot. She just got her last puppy vaccines and in her new vet’s words is “a real girl” now, so she can socialize and walk on public sidewalks safely. Any advice for helping her with her fear aside from just exposure?",2023-12-31 04:13:45
Is it normal to ask adopters of the cats that I foster to stay in touch and reach out to them once in a while?,"I've been fostering kittens for about six months now (a little over 10 different cats have come through), and it's been very tough to let go each time. I have four cats of my own (one of which is a foster cat that I ended up adopting) which are a handful, but I can't help but want to keep each one that comes to me. In particular, there is one female cat that was terribly scared of people when I got her, but eventually warmed up and began to snuggle with me to sleep, sit on my lap while I'm working, etc. Worst of all, one of my cats seems to have bonded very strongly with her, and they seek each other out to sleep together, play together, groom each other. But I know I can't keep them all.

She's getting adopted today, after about three months with me. My question is, would it be acceptable to reach out to her new mom once in a while to check in on the kitten, and ask for updates to see how she's settling in? I've told other adopters in the past that I'd really appreciate any updates or photos they could provide, and a few of them stay in touch regularly which is great. But for the ones that don't, would it be inappropriate for me to reach out once in a while? I am dreading today and can already tell it's going to be hard not to think of her.

Thank you for any advice.",2023-12-30 21:04:28
Why do people continue to over-feed their pets?,"I have family members who constantly give their overweight dogs food from their plate which contains food that is not healthy. How can they see the health condition of their companion and continue aiding in it’s downward spiral? Their 1 year old bird eats constantly from their plates and steals food from their mouths all day, I don’t think a bird should have that much meat and human food with butter or oil but it’s hard to push against it because they don’t belong to me. When they have food they feel obligated to give some to their animals. When I get food they suggest giving a piece to them. Am I overreacting?",2023-12-30 04:59:45
Had my dog go through surgery and I completely regret it,"I found a small lump on my dogs leg a couple of months ago, and while the vet said we can wait til her next dental appointment to get it removed I decided to do it now because I could not stand not knowing if it could potentially be something harmful to my dog(currently waiting on pathology results). She is 5 years old currently taking medication for her allergies so I wanted to make sure that there was no risk to her health.

The lump was very small, and it did not bother her. Her surgery was yesterday and the incision site is triple the size of the lump and she's absolutely miserable during the healing process.

Did I make a mistake getting it removed now? Seeing her in so much pain now makes me regret doing it so much even while I'm still waiting on the results.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your replies. It's really what I needed to hear and hoping that she's back to normal soon ",2023-12-29 23:52:56
"Roommate allergic to my cat, what can we do?","I want to preface that my roommate was 100% on board with me getting a cat!

My (F23) and my roommate (22F) both own a cat and a dog respectively. She had the dog first, and we both knew that once we moved into our next (now current) place that I wanted to get a cat. She loves cats so she was supportive of me getting one, but has always been allergic to them.

I ended up getting one a few months ago, but recently (perhaps due to increased shedding seasons) her allergies have gotten bad, and neither of us realized how bad they would get unfortunately, probably because she had never been around cats for an extended amount of time. The cat has mostly been in my room since I got her because of her allergies and the dog, and whenever she and the dog would be gone for a period of time we would let the cat roam the apartment freely to not be confined which is likely where the problem is happening. We don’t know what to do, because we don’t want her to not be able to live in the apartment, but we also want the cat to be able to roam. 

Moving preferably not an option for us, as we don’t really have the funds or the time to move anywhere else at the moment and we want to be able to work this out to the best of our abilities. The only thing we can think of doing is increasing the intensity of cleaning and the frequency of it and I might try to buy dander wipes, but I don’t really know what else to do long term. Does anyone have any suggestions?",2023-12-29 22:01:22
Declawing Cat,"My friend always wanted a cat, and I have been helping him look into shelters and cats that are a good fit. I found an AMAZING cat that is around two years old and has a great personality. I felt so happy realizing that I found a great companion for my friend- until I realized he wants to declaw the cat. I advocated against this SO much and told him to provide scratching posts and trim his cats nails. Sadly he still wants to declaw the cat. I feel so guilty knowing that I showed him a great cat, and now he will potentially be declawed. I wouldn’t wish that upon any cat, and I’m nervous it will change the cats amazing personality or cause other issues, causing the cat to no longer be a good fit. I feel so guilty and like it’s my fault or I couldn’t prevent this, or even like I put a great cat in this situation :(",2023-12-29 09:11:49

Let’s face facts: you will never get a pet for cheap,"A lot of downsides I see people mention when discussing the pros and cons of owning a specific pet such as Guinea pigs is how expensive they can be. Using Guinea pigs again as an example, they require an expensive cage and more expensive items for their enrichment. Then you’ll need hey, pellets, vegetables, and an exotic vet which is not cheap either. But let’s be real, if your only reason for not owning a piggie is their cost, you best not own a pet at all. Every animal species has some kind of sunk cost when it comes to food and vet bills.",2023-12-28 23:58:35
"People recording themselves ""adopting"" lost pets on social media","For years I have kept seeing these videos people post on social media of themselves finding a dog or cat outside, and then ""adopting"" it instead of searching for the owner. At least, they never say they searched for the owner, but to me that would be extremely important to mention. This is especially disturbing when it's a puppy or kitten that probably just didn't know any better and got lost by accident and misses their family. They always assume the animal was ""abandoned"" by some neglectful owners, but often this is not really the case when pets get lost. It happens all the time, even with the most loving families. What's even worse is the comments all encourage them to ""adopt"" the animal, and no one ever asks if they tried to search for the owner. Does this not bother anyone else? It seems really disturbing to me, but I don't see anyone else objecting to this trend.",2023-12-28 12:56:29

"I'm looking to get an ESA cat, but my lease requires that all cats be declawed. What to do?","So I live in PA, a state that's currently working on a state-wide declawing ban. My lease was signed before I had the chance to read it in full, as they rushed us through the process. This wasn't an issue at the time, however, as I wasn't looking to get a cat (or any other free-roaming animal) almost 2 years ago. My therapist told me that an ESA would help me with my depression and anxiety, so I began looking at my property development's requirements for different pets. I found that getting a cat would be the closest match for what I need, but the state-run development that I live in requires all cats to be declawed. I am HEAVILY against this procedure for obvious reasons, so this has put the process at a complete standstill for me. I'm at a loss. Any advice? TYIA.

Leaving eldery cat behind when moving,"I am 22 years old and I am about to move out of my childhood home. I got a job in new city in a different state, and I move in about a month. A few years ago, my family took in 2 foster cats for a family member going through personal issues. Well, they ended up being foster fails, and we adopted both the cats. They ended up loving our home and loving us, and they were happy here. However, one of my cats got particularly attached to me. She follows me around, meows if I'm not petting her, sleeps in my bed/on my chest every single night. If I'm not home, she'll just find a quiet corner to stay in until I return home. 

I am so scared at the thought of leaving her behind, and her feeling abandoned by me. But I don't know if I can take her. I am supposed to be moving into a friend's house temporarily while I get on my feet, and she already has a dog so I wouldn't be able to bring her there. I've debated just finding a different place to live to take her with me, but I'm worried it'll stress her out. The cat is super old, we know she's at least 16, but is likely older. She's starting to act strange and lose a little weight, so I know it's not long until she'll pass. I don't want her in a scary, unfamiliar environment towards the end of her life (especially because I'll be working in person, not at home the majority of the week), but I'm also crying at the thought of her feeling abandoned by me right before her death, even if she stays in my parents' home.

I have no idea what to do. I spend as much time with her as humanly possible right now, but I want to do right by her. I am her best friend, and she is mine. I wouldn’t dream of dumping an animal at a shelter so it’s not that kind of situation, she’s a “family cat” who has found a special attachment to me. ",2023-12-27 02:26:20

need advice and don’t want to be judged…,"I’ve had my cat for 7 years, she was born in a big beautiful house with a big yard with lots of birds to look at, then we downsized to a little smaller house with a good view, and then recently i moved her into my small ass apartment. she’s got one window and can never see wildlife the way she did before. i work a lot and im not always emotionally there to connect with her (considering she doesn’t initiate connection — i always have to initiate that). 

The first day I brought her here she absolutely hated it. she meowed all night long and made my life hell. it was like no matter what i did she wasn’t happy with how small this place was. then i go on vacation and my neighbor watched her and she transforms. now she sleeps with me and is. ore affectionate. this has gone on for a couple weeks now.. it’s like my neighbor “fixed her” lol. i was only gone for 5 days.

This is not the only time i’ve heard of her liking other people more than me. for instance my mom and her were very cuddly - and my cat never did that with me. 

i have the option to give her to my dad. he lives in a big apartment, she’s known him her whole life… i don’t feel she would miss me and i don’t exactly feel i would miss her. but i know it’s wrong to feel like that. i just feel like if she can have a better quality of life somewhere else with. someone else why would i hold her hostage here?

everyone’s telling me ill be lonely when she’s not here , i wish i would be to feel like im normal, i almost feel sad for myself that im not. she’s so sweet and cute and deserves better.

Teaching my child the importance of kindness,My son and I drove to the convenience store to pick up some more sugar. When we pulled up we noticed two stray cats. One of them was quite friendly. They appeared to be starving so I had my son go back in the store to see if they had cat food. Nope. Then I noticed that the Burger King next door was open. We bought two plain Whopper Jr's then headed back to the store. The friendly one came over to my son immediately and snatched the burger patty right away. The bag blew away so my son chased it into the field behind the store. The other cat was nowhere to be seen. The friendly cat followed my son then ran ahead of him like it was leading him somewhere. He found 2 more cats. There was an abandoned sofa sitting there that they seemed to be living in. I didn't have enough money to get 2 more burgers so he left the buns from the first burger along with the second burger. Hopefully they shared without too much fuss. This was our Christmas good deed. My son said he felt pretty good with what we had done. We moved in with my parents this year and they agreed to our bringing our 5 cats with us. They wouldn't be ok with me bringing home 4 more or I would have scooped them all up. The friendly one was solid black with long hair. I adore black cats. I feel bad that we couldn't bring them home but at least they had a good meal today. The day celebrating giving to others. Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays to all!,2023-12-26 07:51:32
Aftermath of a dog bite,"Hey guys, I have kind of a situation here. My sister and her husband were spending Christmas with our parents. I was also there with my dog( 12 pound chihuahua mix) who gets along great with my parents’ dogs. My sister also brought her dog, an 18 month old Bully. Every time she brings her dog, there’s nothing but problems. He doesn’t get along with any of the other dogs, he doesn’t understand boundaries, he is constantly jumping on people and mouthing( this will be important in a moment.) 

We have been telling my sister that she needs to get her dog under control because this is not a breed of dog that should be allowed to do whatever they want. Her excuse is that he’s only a puppy and he’s very loving. Sure, I get it. But when my parents’ 7 month old puppy is better behaved than he is, I have a hard time sympathizing with my sister. 

Today, while I was sitting on the floor showing some new toys to my dog, the bully approached me. I tried to create some distance between us as I didn’t want this dog in my face. That’s when he bit me. It wasn’t a hard bite, but it was definitely a bite. Again, he has always been a mouthy dog but this wasn’t a dog playfully mouthing someone. There was teeth making contact with my skin and marks were left behind. My sister “corrected” him by yelling at him. 

My question is what happens next? I don’t want to report such a minor bite as it will only cause more issues, but I’m honestly worried that this dog will hurt someone. He’s killed chickens and as I mentioned before, is antagonizing other dogs. What can I do? How can I approach this situation with my sister?",2023-12-26 07:14:48

Caring for a previously abused pet is the best and the worst all at once.,"Every time I comfort them from a nightmare, soothe them when they're triggered, hold them after someone moved too quickly and they thought they were getting hit, I feel a horrible hate for whoever made them this way. 

I hate that they'll never forget their pain. Or for the ones that have passed, never forgot. I hate that no matter how much love and gentleness we show them, there's always that part of them that will always be afraid. I hate that I'm always learning more, like when a dog cries over seeing large black boots or a man in overalls. I hate the awful implications of it all. 

We give them the best life they can. They have vet visits and good food. They have treats every day. There are stockings on the wall filled with treats, toys, and a new collar for each. They get table scraps, probably too many, and fatty cuts of meat. They don't know a harsh hand any more. They have land and forests to explore, and a warm house to sleep in. Usually on the couch. Sometimes taking up the bed.

My family gets to see them get better every day. Each milestone is a celebration. Taking a walk, going to the pet store, greeting children on Halloween. Recently we saw their first zoomies. Their first play fight.

I dont know. Despite everything good at the end of the day I see how much love these guys can give and wonder what kind of freak could look my dogs in the eye and decide to hurt them over and over. Systematic abuse is so intentional. HOW could someone do it over and over and sleep at night??? The idea I could know these people, be friends with them, or even just pass by them at Walmart makes me sick. Especially around the holidays. 

Despite all this I'll never stop taking in abused dogs. I just can't. Until animal abuse is something few and far in between, I can't stand to not do my tiny little part. I love helping a scared dog become healthy and confident again, but I hate the fact that I get to do it.",2023-12-25 17:20:46
"Please help!!!!! Found bat in house, not sure how long my cats and dog had time to play with it","Ive been napping for 4 hours, when I came upstairs there was a bat laid flat in a corner in my kitchen, screaming. 

I know 100% that he is injured because of them. They are indoor cats but anything that gets inside is a goner. 

It’s christmas eve and nowhere is open. I’m scared. I want to keep the bat to get it tested. The timing of this has me so stressed out.

*update*: no medical professional is taking me seriously and letting me come in for a vaccine at either urgent care or via appt. because i don’t have a visible bite or scratch. If i want it I’m going to have to pay for an ER visit per their recommendation 🙃

Vet appt at 8:30 AM tomorrow, glad they’re at least being proactive(ish) with them ❤️

The bat is unresponsive to my help. I’ve tried using a syringe to get him to drink water, and tongs to feed him bugs. I don’t know if my cats seriously injured him or if he is definitely rabid ! Nobody in my family will take it seriously and I have been sobbing all day over this dumb bat. I’m so stressed, they won’t help me at all:( 

He is just sitting there hyperventilating, i got very close to him and all he was able to do was lift his head and open his mouth to threaten me with his fangs 🧛  

I’m bringing him into be tested tomorrow after the vet appointment.  I just am heartbroken he is suffering.

that got long, i am sorry
**tldr:** found cats playing with unresponsive bat, pets getting vaccines/boosters tomorrow, 
bat getting tested tomorrow. 
primary dr won’t take me seriously so going to ER for vaccine for myself.

"I fed my cat pepperoni, will he be okay?","I wasn’t even thinking and decided to give my cat a small piece of pepperoni, like a piece of a piece pretty much, before I could search and see if it was okay. I searched it after he ate and it said that pepperoni is very bad for cats. Will he be okay considering it was just a small piece?

update: he is totally fine just incase anyone was wondering, he didn’t throw up or anything but I definitely won’t be giving him pepperoni again just to be safe. Thanks to everyone who replied!",2023-12-23 12:00:53
I swear my cat understands English,"There are so many stories I can tell. I have 3 cats. The one I got as a kitten is the one this story is about. I am convinced he understands English. Last night, while I was sleeping, my cat came in and started scratching the headboard of the bed. I told him to stop a couple times. Nope. I told him ""This is your last warning, if you scratch one more time I will kick you out. Not out of the room, but all the way outside."" Not a single scratch more. This is just one story, but we have so many examples. He has to understand us.",2023-12-23 10:34:12
My dog stopped liking me since she hurt my hand,"My dog has been acting strange around me since we got back from a walk i took her on which resulted in her fracturing and snapping a ligament in my finger by tugging on her lead. She doesnt want to play with me which is strange as she LOVES to play, has stopped sitting next to me on the sofa, no longer follows me around the house, doesnt come when i call her name, and overall is just acting very cold to me. Shes acting absolutely fine with everyone else, so its not a matter of her being ill or injured, and is still eager to play and cuddle with my sister and parents. Does anyone have any ideas as to why she’s acting this way?

EDIT: Hey guys, thanks for the help. The incident happened four days ago and since then, I’ve been taking your advice and reassuring her a lot. Its really helped and today she is acting so much more normal with me, in fact she’s cuddled up next to me on the sofa right now!! I truly believe it was a matter of guilt as i didnt scold her at all at the time or even after, and she reacted well to the reassurance. Just happy we’re getting back to normal !!",2023-12-23 08:18:14
Did I get scammed by the doggy dentist?,"After an annual checkup with my dog’s vet, they referred me to a dentist as they thought her canines may be fractured (pulp showing).
After the $175 consultation with the dentist I was quoted $1400 for a treatment plan for her canines (which they stated weren’t fractured, but had tennis ball abrasion so may need work) in addition to checking on a previous root canal done at another vet.

When I took her in yesterday the final bill ended up being $2100! 
They said treatment plan they had quoted me (work on the two canines and the molar with a pre-existing root canal) did not need to be done, as all 3 teeth were fine & healthy with no issues.
But, they now realized they needed to remove 2 incisors (this ended up being the only work she had done).
I’m confused how the cost went up so much with this change & how what she had done was COMPLETELY different from what was mentioned at her consult… she’s had an incisor removed before at another specialist (that this dentist actually said he went to school with!) and it was nowhere near $2100…

Most of the bill was various kind of medications (isoflurane, dopamine, meloxicam, ketamine, hydromorphone, midazolam, propofol, bupivacaine, buprenophtine, atropine sulfate)

EDIT: cleared up what actual work she had done.",2023-12-23 00:50:34
Theory on how “outdoor cats” survive,"I found out my neighbor adopted a cat because it started showing up at MY house. Super sweet and friendly.  We let her in when it got cold out, she did fine with the litter box and slept with my Mom (who’s 80).  No messes, no problems, cuddled for hours on end. 

Of course I let neighbor know cat was here, she was fine with that.  I asked if she could stay over once and neighbor was fine with that, too. We let cat out in the morning.  It got to be a regular thing, with cat showing up as I came home from work, and I didn’t mention it each time because if neighbor cared, why would cat be at my house?

Only shelter I saw on neighbor’s porch was a plastic tote with an entry hole and blankets inside, and neighbor said this was a strictly outdoor cat because neighbor has allergies. 

This past week it was cold and cat wanted to stay here all day long. So the  neighbor missed cat, and I took cat back to them.  Turns out they do have plans to let cat indoors, they’re working on a better shelter, and we’re going to get our own cat for my Mom to take care of. So, happy ending. 

Here’s the thing where I think my neighbor - and other people with “outdoor cats” - is delusional. But I’m not gonna argue with neighbor because I like our happy ending, so I’m posting here instead. 

Neighbor told me how cat came into her possession and said former owner just kept it in a barn as a mouser, and it lived under the porch or wherever and managed to survive because “cats are so resourceful”.

I think that is baloney. 

I think former owner had a neighbor who was taking care of cat, just as Mom and I were doing. And former owner didn’t care enough to keep tabs on cat so had no idea. Just like neighbor didn’t realize cat was spending every night over here. 

Because how else would the cat be so well-behaved indoors?

A white cloud who loves sausages,"The other day my Samoyed organized this mission in search of a secret. He sneaked into the kitchen when someone wasn't home, out of search for something delicious. A large plate of sausages caught his attention. My dog ​​couldn't stop, jumped on the chair and started eating the sausages. Fortunately, they were there until the last one and when they released, they covered him. When we got home, there was a white cloud sitting in the middle of the table with a smile from ear to ear. You cannot cause a view to happen because of a view. From that moment until its inception, it became the most greedy and sausage-loving Samoyed around.",2023-12-22 06:09:08
Cat had open sore and vets are unhelpful,"I've had my cat, Athena, for almost 3 years now. Around this time last year, I noticed she was kind of winking a lot and avoiding light. A few days go by and she's obviously got pink eye and the same side of her face (right) is swollen, we take her to the vet. She gets checked out, meds, cool. Everything is fine. Until a few days later, when her eye is fine but her face is still swollen. Bad. Back to the vet. They cut the absess while trying to shave her, didn't even get to technically lance it. They send us home with antibiotics and the only care instructions being ""wipe her face occasionally with a warm cloth."" When I call to ask what I supposed to do about her oozing pus all over my belongings, I'm met with no help. Finally it closes. Very cool. It takes awhile, but it does happen.  Okay. Well, in July her face starts swelling again, rapidly. No pink eye this time, but an absess. This time we try a different vet, they say the ear on that side is dirty but that there's no infection or parasite that they can see. But it may be an ear infection causing the absess. It bursts in August. It stays open for almost 4 months. When I go back, they give me more antibiotics and no answers. It finally closed earlier this month. Another has already ruptured and I didn't even see swelling. I know it makes her miserable. When it first happens she spends days in the same place, not socializing with me or the other cats, barely eating/ drinking/ etc. I feel terrible and I want to help but I'm not being told anything. She fights cleaning and medicine terribly, I do it but it's a bloody struggle.",2023-12-22 04:12:09
Why do we keep doing this to ourselves..?,"Last night I had to make the decision to put down my sweet baby girl… she was very lethargic and the vet said it may be 2 things which we can get treatment for so I was prepared… she did some blood work and turns out it was kidney failure… nothing we can do to help.. vet said it was best to let her rest… she was 13 years and she was our others dogs puppy so I was with her since she was born. 

Well I haven’t stopped crying since last night… I decided to be with her for the whole process holding her the entire time I couldn’t let her go through it alone but it really messed me up.. seeing her go and holding her weight really messed me up (I would do it  again though) but damn her face is all I see. I miss her so much. My small baby girl.. I keep having thoughts of how I could have done more to show I loved her.. I hate this so much

Sorry I’m rambling so much but why do we keep having these sweet babies in our lives knowing how much it’s gonna hurt us. This isn’t my first time losing a furry family member but this is my first time losing one that was all mine.. and just before the holidays.. idk I just hurt so much rn… saying goodbye didn’t feel long enough


EDIT: I just wanna thank every one of you guys who commented for your kind words and own personal stories of loss, it truly means so much to me.. I know this pain will be the worst for a while but in time it will hurt less, I also know it hurts but not as much as the love I experienced since my fur baby has been in my life.

Dog ripped her toenail off and vet is not making a big deal out of it,"A couple days ago my dog caught her nail in something without noticing and pulled the nail fully off. Just the pink quick is exposed. I called the vet and they advised to keep it clean and dry. I cleaned it the best I could, and allowed my dog to clean it herself to get rid of the dry blood etc.  


This morning it is looking redder than yesterday, and I'm worried she will get an infection. I sent my vet some photos this morning and waiting for a response still. What's most concerning to me is that she is refusing almost everything today. Not interested in food or water or going to the bathroom. She won't let me cover her injured paw so we only go out for a few minutes at a time and she just lays there. She had a #2 accident in the house yesterday after refusing to go outside, not mad about it and happy she relieved herself but concerned about her stubbornness.   


Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",2023-12-22 00:26:46
UPDATE: New Kitten Regrets,"Hi all, no one asked for an update but I'm going to provide one anyways LOL. My previous post (reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/189lavy/new_kitten_regrets/) was about my sick, scared kitten who had bouts of diarrhea and was so smelly because she had to have a cone on due to her tail amputation and couldn't clean herself. I couldn't clean her because she was way too scared and she would just poop herself!!

Well, I ended up taking her back to the vet a couple days after that post because her poos were not getting better at all and I was so worried and they diagnosed her with a bacterial infection, saying they saw weird looking bacteria in her poos. After prescribing her with proviable stool hardener (I forget what it's called, it's the kit one) and antibiotics, she got better almost immediately!! Her poos were hardening and was no longer having diarrhea. She was also starting to act like a kitten more and more each day. She was in cage rest until her surgery recheck appointment, but she was jumping up and down from her box igloo a couple days before she was able to be free!!

As soon as she got her cone off, me and my partner gave her a bath (she did not like that) so she could freely explore our home. By this point, her poos are no longer an issue, although I am still giving her proviable supplements daily, just to help with her digestive system. She is such a wonderful kitten, although full of energy and doesn't seem like playing with her for hours will tire her out LOL. But we are just so happy she is better now and is acting like a cat now!! I think I made that last post at the height of my stress and now that everything is stable-ish now, we wouldn't give her up for the world. She is really the love of our lives and our true fate cat!! She turns 2 months old officially in a couple of days and we are so happy to watch her grow up!!

I do want to, in the future, adopt a second kitten so she can have a friend, but I've spent so much on her recently that idk if my wallet can handle that right now LOL. But she seems fine on her own and we play with her tons!! She already knows not to use her claws when she paws at us and we've been redirecting her furniture destroying habits into toys and play!! I would do cat tax but idk how to upload pics on here.... BUT thanks to those who gave me advice and warm words, they really helped!!",2023-12-21 07:47:36

My cat is grieving,"8 and a half years ago I adopted 2 cats. They were together at the shelter, both assumed to be born around the same time and were the same age but not from the same litter.   


My cats loved each other dearly. I will refer to them as K and R in this post.   


see my ex always said he hoped K passed first... he didn't think that K would handle it well if R passed first.   
But overtime.. I realized how backwards he was...   
See, eventually  I moved out and took my cats with me when I moved  
After moving to the new placed R immediately ran and crawled underneath K ... she needed him in this new and strange place.   
I knew then, that she depended on him more... for weeks he spent time going under the bed to comfort her when I wasn't around because.. she wouldn't come out...   
Eventually we moved again, and she handled it better. But still K was there for her. 

This last 6 months I noticed R seemed abnormally... concerned when it came to K. See, R doesn't like to leave my room, this is her comfort space. But if K was out of the room for too long, she would meow (abnormal for her... she literally only makes sound when something is bothering her a lot). Because of this, I would pick up K and return him to the room and she would stop. 

Then K meowed one day, a different meow than normal, but my 14 year old kid was messing with him (don't worry.. he loved the kid, i'm still unsure what made him meow...) but R went running to ensure he was ok.   


I took this as her just being concerned because she loved him.. but now I think she knew something was wrong with him.  


About 3-4 weeks later K suddenly passed. Signs he displayed indicate he may have had a heart condition... but honestly.. he seemed fine other than being abnormally clingy with my kid for a week and then one day he distanced himself and boom... we noticed a few signs, I went to searching for a vet open on the weekend... and about the time the vets office opened, he just ... went...  


R didn't sleep for 3 days after he passed. She licked herself so bad she started to bleed, it affected my sleep cause she would stay on top of me and move every 2 seconds (including the obsessive cleaning and all). And I'm serious about the not sleeping.. I ended up getting her a fuzzy baby blanket and swaddled her cause 3 days in she hadn't slept... she wouldn't let me put her down (she was eating and using the litterbox, but outside of that I held her... she had to be held...) and she finally passed out... and passed out so hard that I thought she had suddenly died (like i screamed... legit.. and she woke up and stared at me and started purring).  


Anyway.. its been a couple months now. I can put her down now.. she is sleeping now.. though i think she's not really sleeping when I'm not home... if I'm out of the room too long she meows now (found that out when I went to shave my legs and I guess I took too long lol).   
But now she's pickier about food, she's still clinging to me which makes working from home difficult when I don't have space to move the mouse... and she still doesn't sleep in the bed unless i'm in it... (she legit just stays by my side.. but not even sleeping.. just sitting.. watching...   


I had considered getting a kitten, I feel she needs company and I know she does well with kittens, but some stuff happened  (my kid is in trouble, and my roommate wont allow the kitten thing because of it).

So now I'm thinking a stuffed animal?    
Opinions on helping her through this?

Cat thinks I'm drowning,"Just thought you all would find this funny.

Every time I take a shower or a bath, my 23 year old cat freaks out and yowls loudly at me. She tries hard to get my attention. She's been checked by the vet, she's perfectly healthy.

Dog has been sick for the past 4 days,"Hi everyone. I have a 4 year old dog, lab mix, male, & neutered. I woke up Saturday morning to puddles of vomit & him vomiting, which continued throughout the day for a total of \~6-7 vomits. He vomited on Sunday two more times as well. Vomit looked mostly like bile/liquid, usually yellow & green/dark green.

  
Brought him to the vet, who gave him fluids and an anti-nausea medication. He would not eat his regular food and would only drink water sometimes when I brought it to him. Gave him chicken and rice according to the vet's suggestion, and he would eat some of that.

  
However, he continued to vomit on Monday, so brought him back for an X-ray to check for an internal blockage. X-ray was apparently negative according to the radiologist (vet said he thought there was one spot that he thought was slightly more dilated than normal, but vet said he had to fall back on the radiologist's conclusion). Sent him off with more fluids, a stronger anti-nausea medication, as well as probiotic supplements. Dog did have some spit up of bile that night, but no major puking.  


Today, my dog has not vomited, but continues to be lethargic, shaky at times, and now will not eat or drink anything. I am extremely concerned & am not really sure what to do. Vet said if not a blockage, then this would pass, but I am worried we are waiting on something that is more serious. Any insight or ideas are appreciated.

***Update: Took him to the vet for blood work & pancreatitis test tonight. Blood work came back good, except for a slight elevation of WBC, vet said due to some inflammation. Pancreatitis test was negative. We are going back tomorrow for an ultrasound. So very perplexing & just so concerned, but hoping we get more answers tomorrow. Thank you all again for your input.

***Final update: Had the ultrasound yesterday-- lo & behold, they found a foreign body in his intestines. He went straight into emergency surgery after his condition worsened (excessive drooling, regurgitating bile every hour, shaking, lethargy). Turned out to be a squeaker from one of his toys. Incredibly thankful none of his intestines were severely damaged enough to the point of needing removal. Surgery went smoothly & he is in recovery now, getting better every hour. To be fully transparent, after visits to the vet for 5 days & an emergency surgery, total cost is looking to be ~13k. Get pet insurance now if you don't have it & ask about payment plan options (preferably interest free) if you are in this situation. Still shaken up, but extremely happy our doggy will be back to his normal self soon. Thank you all for your well wishes & input.",2023-12-20 05:46:29
Refusing to Spay Cats,"I have a 35 yo cousin who lives with her parents and she has two female cats against her parent's wishes (her parents don't like pets). These cats are not spayed and they have been giving birth to multiple generations of kittens because my cousin refuses to spay them as she thinks the process could harm them. These kittens are a financial and emotional burden on her parents, who also have to find a home for the kittens everytime the cat gives birth (my cousin refuses to take any action or help out); and despite multiple desperate pleas, my cousin doesn't want the cats to undergo this simple, natural procedure. This is also a problem because they live in a place where there's an overpopulation of stray animals so it's far from easy to find a place for so many kittens. Her parents are really desperate and have tried to convince her but she's deadset on the spaying issue. Their house is constantly filled with more cats than they can support and they are struggling.

So I stole a cat,"My neighbors moved here in the summer and have been leaving their cat outside. I don't like this but the cat was okay. Cut to now (December) and it was below freezing and the cat was still outside. I caught it drinking out of a dirty puddle. 😠 Long story short I scooped the cat but am worried because I know which neighbors it is and I had previously asked them if it was their cat. They don't that I'm their nexdoor neighbor though because I left a note on their door with instructions to text me. I am still worried because what if they come after me or what if they really liked the cat. What if it's chipped and the humane society calls the owners. I just want this buddy to be safe.

UPDATE: For those who are still tuned in, I text the owners the following morning. I still haven't heard anything so me and and my cat buddy are chilling. It actually laid with me on the couch last night and my heart melted. I would show if I knew how to upload images 🤷

Can’t handle the noise,"Tw/ talks of self harm, just a bit of a vent post. I am not kind when talking about this bird

  A little background, my mom decided to get a macaw 3 years ago. She did not consult any of the family and wasn’t even prepared for the bird. She had no idea what she was getting into. She loves having things to show off on Facebook, and this was just fascinating to all her middle aged friends. 

  I’ve always had sensory issues. I can’t handle loud noises and get extremely overwhelmed. I break down sobbing and with anger. It’s overstimulating to the point where I feel the only way I can calm down is harming myself. She ignores the bird for hours on end every day so it screams and screams its head off all day. She’s not a good pet owner. When I start getting overstimulated I ask her to hold the bird multiple times before I break down, she rarely does until I’m in hysterics. I use noise canceling headphones while the bird is on the second floor with me in the basement and I can still hear it. 

  Today, I asked my mom if she could calm down her monster. The bird has been a huge conflict in the family. In retaliation she runs the vacuum for an hour when I say something rude about the bird, it makes the bird scream more. I hate that animal and the sensory hell it puts me through. I’m even angrier at my mom for putting me through this for her own selfishness. Every one of my siblings has tried to convince her to get rid of the bird, my sister knows people who work with birds that could find a suitable home. The bird is extremely aggressive towards others and has made multiple people bleed. My mom continues to put it on others where it continues to bite people. I can’t take it anymore, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to say. 

  She’s said it’s unfair to give the bird up after taking it on, which I agree with! Although I feel she does not properly take care of it, ignoring it for entire days while it’s screaming for her attention. I think she refuses to admit she made a mistake when getting that bird and now we’re all just angry all the time and i’m constantly agitated. Her argument is that I can just leave the house, but I don’t feel like I should have to leave the house to feel calm. I should be able to get silence and peace in my own home. 

I don’t know what to do, I feel like it’s genuinely driving me crazy and that i’m gonna end up hurting the bird in a fit of blind rage. I don’t want to hurt the bird but I can’t take it. I feel so guilty and I’m not an aggressive person. I don’t know how to get my mom to listen that she can’t properly take care of the bird and that it’s causing so much harm to the family.",2023-12-19 02:00:49
Am I horrible for not letting cats sleep with me for one night?,"Hey, so I'm housesitting currently for my neighbour who has two adorable but clingy Burmese cats. I've housesat for her multiple times before, including one time for almost a month. They're incredibly sweet, and were rescued from breeders. I love cats and have had them my whole life, so I do a pretty good job taking care of them if I do say so myself. 

On to the issue. One of the cats, Stella, has bowel issues due to her being an ex-breeder. She had to be put under anaesthetic and get an enema. Since then she's been on stronger laxatives and before (happened last week), and tonight finally had a bowel movement. The owner mentioned she might get diarrhoea, which she kinda has? It's not liquid but it's def all gooey. No problem, I've got instructions on what to do re laxatives. 

The issue is she's now a stinky lil girl, and has some liquid poop on her bum. I'm writing this at 11pm, don't really feel like traumatising the poor girl anymore by trying to clean her, but also don't want poop spread all over my bedsheets night 1. I feel horrible locking her out especially cause she's been through so much, and the other cat hasn't got any reason to be locked out. 

The owner made it clear that its fine to close my door on them at night, and believe me when I say these kitties have not been short on love, but I feel like an absolute monster for not letting the cats in the bedroom tonight. ",2023-12-18 22:59:39

AITA for wanting to delay our cat’s chemo until after my holiday trip?,"X-posting from AITA, don’t think they really get pets.

Me and my ex co-parent a cat together. About a month ago, our vet found a lump on its mammaries. After several vet visits and tests, we finally got confirmation this week that the cancer has metastasized to her lungs.

The oncologist told us that surgery is no longer recommended. Chemo is still an option, but it wouldn’t cure her, only potentially slow the disease progression. My ex would like to still go through with it, and I agreed that it was worth trying. However, I didn’t realize that meant that if our cat started chemo this week, that my ex would want me to cancel my trip home for Christmas in order to be around for the our cat’s recovery. I was originally prepared to cancel my trip if our cat was recovering from surgery, and even after that was no longer recommended, I still shortened my trip, from a week down to four days. I told my ex that I didn’t think waiting an extra week until after my trip to start the chemo would make much difference. They want to start it as soon as possible, since that is what’s best for the cat. I think the difference may be marginal at best. The oncologist was hesitant to give a life expectancy, but our cat has still been active and hasn’t had any breathing issues yet, so it’s not like I’m leaving our cat on it’s deathbed.

For some additional context, my ex is estranged from their parents, and were already planning on spending the holidays alone. The period from Thanksgiving thru December is always rocky between us, and it’s true that I often haven’t made enough space to comfort them during this difficult season for them. Even now, I love our cat, but want to balance that with still seeing my family. I don’t have any other trips planned after this one, and plan on being around to see things through to the end once I return.

Am I the asshole for wanting to delay my cat’s chemo until after my holiday trip so I can see my family?",2023-12-17 17:48:07
Leaving for a month and really worried about my pets.,"I have two cats and a dog.  I'm going back to my home state for a month, and I'm so scared they will become depressed or be upset with me. I have a sitter who will check on them twice daily and even let them out in the fenced backyard for a bit each day.  But I feel like I'm not doing enough and leave in 3 days.  Should I do something else to help? 

 They have auto feeders and a fountain because they all like running water. I'm terrified to leave them alone for so long, especially since one keeps breaking out of the house because he's a big cat that can open the front/back doors. He has successfully done it before while I slept. 
I have child locks but can't figure out a renter-friendly way to do the front door, so I'm using hair ties to apply pressure upwards. Any advice helps.

Edit: I'm getting a house sitter.  My anxiety and y'all are correct on this.  

Edit (season 2): The babies will be safe and sound. I also changed the date to come back sooner, even though I'll get in shit for it but idrc. I have to rely on a few different people around the neighborhood, and tomorrow, I meet them and see how it goes. I can't thank everyone enough for all the input.

Edit (season 3): Yes, I have a pet sitter now for all of them. 
My husband wanted me to rectify the information I shared because he said I didn't give enough details, so people were calling me abusive because of that. I have a camera, I have pheromone plugins, one of those litter robots, and I have remote access to play with them through the camera. I have a cat tree for them and three different scratching posts, as well as a designated area just for them to chill if they are feeling overwhelmed. I've instructed the sitter to leave on pet TV while they pet sit at the house. I'm leaving dirty laundry (shirts) with my scent on it in all their comfort places. I promise I'm not just leaving them to die. I even have fairy lights constantly on around their area since they love lights. ",2023-12-16 16:33:55
Guilt from surrendering stray,"Idk if this is the appropriate sub but oh well
I caught a stray and had to give her up to SPCA. she would have died if she stayed where she was. I feel so so so bad. my heart hurts. I wish I could’ve kept her and helped her reacclimate to humans and pet life bc I can tell she would be an angel but I have two cats at home and no space for her to have her own space and be calm and I just feel so guilty. any advice for how to handle this feeling? It’s my first time catching a stray and having to do this ~",2023-12-16 07:22:05
Neighbour keeps calling her cat at stupid times and just keeps on and on and on till it shows,My neighbour has a cat called fluffy and I am woken up every morning at 5 to neighbour stood in the garden calling the cat. She also whistles as if its a dog and also makes silly noises till the cat shows. Also at night like gone midnight she does it. I have spoke to her not to do it at stupid times and I asked her so nice too and she picks up a right attitude about it and then she has the cheek to complain about my tv being on a bit too loud.,2023-12-16 01:50:35
Toxic stuff for dogs/cats - Why no natural avoidance by animals?,"All or most pet owners know the toxic stuff for dogs, cats etc. Typical ones cocoa, garlic, onion etc. There's a long list.

Do we know though why these animals which highly rely on their instincts for almost everything do not naturally avoid these products?

I've always thought animals by their instincts know what's good for them and what's not in nature, and they only consume the good stuff for them, while avoiding harmful things they encounter, knowing it could kill them. If that's true, why would our dog or cat simply not refuse to eat a chocolate they find, say by smelling the dangerous cocoa, caffeine etc. in it?",2023-12-15 22:32:30
My roommate is upset I called her a bad cat owner,"Background: I've been living with her for nearly a year and she has two cats. She's always lived alone and we moved into together because how expensive it is to live alone. She's also an only child and grew up being doted upon by her parents. She' always lived alone prior and probably was able to avoid doing certain chores for awhile. I grew up with cats and was happy to live with them and help out every once in a while, but they are still her primary responsibility.

One of cats acts out often, mostly pooping or peeing on her bed when she is away. They will also poo on the couch. At the same time, there have been multiple times where the litter has been pretty full and she hasn't cleaned it for several days. I would mention it and say that could be contributing to the poo on the couch, as I know cats will relieve themselves elsewhere if their litter is full. She's excused this by saying that they do it out of general spite (and not because their litter is full). I've asked her to clean it more often, especially because of the smell, but also I'm concerned for them, too (something I haven't said directly to her).

Anyway, a cat pooped on the couch the other day (Wednesday) and the litter has been full all weekend and was still full by that day. I texted her and said to also clean the litter, and that cats act out. She responded she cleaned it Sunday (which I frankly don't believe) and she'll do it now, and that they weren't acting out and to stop calling her a bad cat owner. I confronted her and she started yelling at me, saying I have said she's a bad cat owner and that I've said it numerous times, but she could only name one time (I had friends and was venting about how she makes excuses for the cats and their bad behaviour, and also the litter and she overheard). I apologized, but still held my ground that the litter needs to be emptied more often. She then went on about how she knows them well and I've been offering unsolicited cat advice, to which I countered that I grew up with cats and know the litter needs to cleaned every one to two days. She begrudgingly agreed to do it every two days, but was still mad. She's calmed down and made a point to share the alarm she set to clean it in the next two days and talked about using a different type of litter, but I just think it's performative and I won't believe anything she promises until she demonstrates she's cleaning it regularly. We've had this discussion before a few times and I've kept up with what she has asked of me in regards to other things in our place but it's not reciprocated by her. She also makes excuses for herself as well about not getting things done and it's starting to get on my nerves.

She loves these cats and they are her world but that doesn't excuse not properly caring for them.

I'm coming on here not to validate me calling her a bad owner, I admitted that was mean of me to do but more so that the litter needs to be emptied more often - even a lot of websites have said to do it DAILY, maybe even more than once a day to maintain cleanliness.

EDIT: There's two boxes, one for each cat.",2023-12-15 05:38:44
How do i get my dog and cat's custody?? I'm turning 18 in less than a year and my mom is never home with them.,"I am f17. I have a 2 year old dog (pitbull, turning 3 on Dec 26th, so in 12 days) and an almost 2 year old cat (who I found as a stray, starving and tired and adopted her). I am turning 18 in less than a year, and my mom, though has legal ownership of the pets, is never home to take care of them. Does not take my dog outside during the day until she gets home at almost 6:30-7PM most days (which I always do). I feed him breakfast and dinner pretty much every day, play with him, train him, take him on walks, etc. She barley ever does any of this. As for my cat, I take care of her too. We just recently got her, so she often stays in a room and I am working on socializing her eith my dog. He is never mean to her or would hurt her, but just wants to play very intensely  which is scary to her and I am trying to train him not to, and get them used to each other slowly. Which again, i am the only one who does that. If I fall asleep, my mom does not feed my cat dinner most of the time. I feed her breakfast almost every day, unless my mom (rarely) has already done it. I clean her litter box and refill her water, play with her and everything. I do have an alarm set to feed her dinner every night, which 95% of the time, I am awake for, but I am a deep sleeper and rarely am not awake to alarms during naps. I discussed this with my mom before we got both the dog and the cat (they eat dinner at different times) and as my mother lives here and legally owns them, she agreed to feed my cat if I am not awake at 6:30PM (which is her dinner time). She is always home at 6:30- 7:15PM (at the latest) whether she has work or not that day. I, too have a job, but it is for a shorter amount of time (usually 9 or 10AM-4 or 4:30PM). 
Now don't get me wrong, I love having pets and always do the best I possibly can to take care of them. I have had dogs, cats, fish, and even reptiles always since I was 3, but we don't have a lot of money so I am not able to be home with the pets 24/7. When I turn 18, I want to get ownership of my dog and cat as I know when I leave the house, my girlfriend and I will take better care of them than my mom and little brother would. I do not want to get my mom in trouble for animal neglect/abuse, as she has never been purposely bad to them, but when I leave the house I know everyone would be better off if the pets were with us. How can I get ownership of them? My mom would consent to this, but are there any other steps? Anything else I need to do?


Edit: I respect both their boundaries very well and always closely monitor them when they are near or in the same room. My cat never has been and never will be constantly locked up in her from for more than 2 hours max. except at night. There are many places in our house that are safe for her to go until they get used to each other. As I have specified in comments, we have only had her for about 2 months and would never rush them to get used to each other, but my dog has never ever been aggressive toward her or any other cats he's met (which has been a lot). If she gets scared or he, overly excited even a little, we seperate them immediately. I never ignore either of them and I take great care of both. Just please understand that for different dogs and cats with different personalities, it takes different amount of times to get them used to each other. Sometimes it could be a week, sometimes 6 months. This is not the first time I've done this, just the first time I've had a stray cat who is more skittish. I am not asking for advice on how to socialize them to each other, I, and many people I know are well experienced in that, and I have gotten help and advice on that from many people. That is not the question I am asking. I am simply asking for advice on how I can get legal ownership of them when I turn 18, even if I do not move put immediately. None of you personally know me, my dog or my cat or their personalities in depth. My cat is extremely comfortable in our house, just still getting used to the dog. I am not looking for advice on that. If i wanted more info on that, i would ask. Please read some of my comment replies before commenting yourself. Thank you:)",2023-12-15 02:53:23
Is this animal abuse?? I need advice on what to do,"I have these coworkers who are dating.. one in the office who works next to me and her boyfriend is one of the drivers for our company and they have two boxers. Back in August they got their 3rd eviction and she stated that her 17 reptiles (geckos and snakes) are all in a ""better place now"" they left them all to rot and die in their evicted trailer.. and they moved in to their friends house with their 2 dogs and 1 cat.. well they got kicked out of their friends house December 1st and moved into her boyfriends sisters house who does not want the dogs in her house due to animal fur.... so they have been bringing their 2 dogs to work EVERY SINGLE DAY from as early as 5am to 5pm and LEAVING THEM IN THE CAR THE WHOLE FUCKING WORK DAY!!! they both will check on the dogs periodically throughout the day to let them out to go to the bathroom and drink a little water for 5 mins top each time.. I was on vacation all last week and was unaware this was happening.. I got back this past Monday and I have been a total mess over this.. its fucking 25 degrees in Michigan and FREEZING. I talked to the owner and he states there is nothing we can do, they are going through a lot and cannot ask them to not bring them to work anymore.. and he told me to leave it alone. I reached out to my aunt who said she will take both dogs in and adopt them, they have a HUGE yard, my aunt doesn't work as her husband owns his own business and they very successful.. these dogs would be loved and they would have full visitation rights whenever they please. When I offered that to my coworker she said no way in hell, she wants both of her dogs...  
  
She has until the end of this month to find a home and be out of her boyfriends sisters house (which means she will have to bring them to work every single day as the December days keep getting colder and colder) and if she doesn't find a house she said her mom and dad will let her and boyfriend move back in with their cat but her parents also do not want her dogs in the house she said they will have to stay in the car the whole time or hopefully her parents will let them sleep in crate in the basement with them but she will still have to bring them to work everyday... Y'all its fucking winter and its only going to get colder.. I cannot be bystander and watch this happen.  
  
I need advice... is this as fucked up as I think it is? What can I do? If I call animal control- the whole office will know its me as I just got back from vacation.. but I don't know if I care anymore.. I can't let this go on.. They need to stop being fucking selfish and if they really love their dogs they would would want better for them.. I'M TORN.  
  
Also, today I asked if the dogs had blankets in the car and she said no.. she said she turns on the heat every so often.. but for the past hour I've been clocked in, the car has been off. (its the coldest in the morning too.....)",2023-12-14 22:28:52
I rescued a stray and I didn't think it through,"I thought because I've seen him for months in the park where I walk and he was so friendly toward me that he would be ok in our home. I had no idea about cats so it was my ignorance not researching before hand. He is hiding behind moving boxes as we are moving in 3 weeks. He did not eat food or use litter box last night. I'm not quite certain how to move in 3 weeks without totally upsetting him again. I've been a dog person my whole life.

"Unofficially adopted cat from a friend I am no longer friends with, never had information changed","So, when my friend adopted her cat, she was able to have one in her living situation. After less than a year, she had to leave and couldn't take the cat, so I took her in. 

We had a BIG falling out and are no longer friends at all. Part of the reason for it is that she was becoming very sneaky, petty, and lied all the time. I just didn't want anything to do with her anymore. We didn't end our friendship on good terms at all. 

Now though, I wonder, what happens when I bring this cat to the vet? Are they going to see my friend's contact information on the microchip and not give her back? Are they going to think I stole her? What do I do? I believe my friend lost all the cat's adoption papers, so I never got them when I took in the cat.

I'm just struck because I would be completely heartbroken to lose my cat. She's been with us for over two years, bonded with my family and my other cat. I want to get her shots updated and get her a check-up, but I'm scared they won't give her back, and that my friend will be petty enough to claim I stole her.",2023-12-14 04:28:25

Male Neuter gone wrong,"If you’re a professional veterinary please read and give me advice. 

I have 2 male cats aged 2 years old that I neutered last week. I neutered them at Banfield Hospital. When I picked them up the care instructions were to leave the cones on, give them antibiotics, and spotting would be normal. They said that there was no stitches as they performed the surgery with a technique that didn’t require a suture. For reference, one of my cats was large and difficult and my other cat is small and an actual angel. When they handed them over to me the had told me my larger cat was giving them problems and wasn’t being cooperative but said my smaller cat was an absolute angel.

 I got to the car and my smaller cat was going absolutely insane.. He got out of his cone while inside of his carrier and I was driving and pulled over and took him out and put him in my lap as I was driving. He tried to lick his (or did) incision but I grabbed him immediately and held him against me as I drove. There was spotting on my jeans from where he was sitting and I was really nervous but again they told me spotting was normal. I felt like something was wrong but I didn’t want to seem paranoid.

 I took him home, put on his cone and tried to care for him. He obviously tried to take off his cone but couldn’t and he was so irritated that he was banging his cone against his testicles and his cone literally had blood on it. I was at this point almost sure something was wrong. I took off of work and waited another hour, at this point I’m looking up what is normal after neutering. I monitored him and just didn’t feel comfortable with the amount of spotting so I brought him to the emergency vet. when the doctor finally saw him, they took him out of his carrier, and the carrier was full with blood. they then say that they do not think this is normal and they would double check everything with him to make sure that he is OK. when the doctor came back, they said that he definitely would need to suture up the incision because they think that the self tie did not hold and they would have to put him under anesthesia again. they gave us a bill before they even performed anything and it was over $800 going up to $1200. we obviously continued with the process, and we received him back with some sutures on his incision and told us to just keep him away from his area, and to give him his antibiotics and to give him some pain meds because he went through two surgeries.

This is what my invoice said at the emergency hospital:

Milo presented for evaluation of severe hemorrhage after a neuter today. His right testicle vessel appears to have slipped out of the ligature/self tie. Milo was sedated, the incision was made bigger and the vessel was tied off. A future sutures were punt into the scrotum to close the extent of the incision, but a small portion was left open to allow it to drain. This suture will absorb over the next few weeks.

next day comes around and I call Banfield and let them know what happened. They said they would get back to me and to send them all the information and they would have someone reach out in regards to having the bill taken care of. after a few days, they called me back and basically tried to argue with me about what had happened that day because the emergency hospital wrote in their notes that my cat was licking his incision. I told them exactly what happened and how it happened and they’re trying to use the fact that I didn’t take my cat back to their location right away when he was spotting as a reason for not paying the bill. They said that the reason this could’ve happened is because my cat licked their incision and the suture slipped. 

It didn’t click in my mind just then, but I remembered after that there was NO suture when I picked him up because that’s what they told me. I told them that I wanted to speak to somebody who would be able to help me more because I didn’t think it was fair
 That would have to pay half the bill when I thought it was their fault. They kept reiterating that because I didn’t bring him back right away I was at fault.

My question is am I liable for what happened or should I demand that they pay the full bill or even sue them for what happened?
 

EDIT: I think it’s important to mention that when my boyfriend dropped them off they said they didn’t have their appointment booked. We booked our appointment in person and the girl who mistakenly didn’t put it in said she was sorry and she knew that she probably didn’t finalize the appointment. The doctor came out to assess and apologized and said it was their mistake. They said that they would try to get the surgeries done for both of them but they have a large lump to remove and they don’t know if they’ll have time so they said no guarantee that it would get done. Is it possible they rushed through it and didn’t properly tie the vessel correctly? ",2023-12-13 22:10:17
Neutering pets,"Years ago I brought my Tom cat to the vet. The vet asked me if I wanted him neutered, I said yes. He said he would  add $5.00 to the bill and neuter him. Tha does not happen today. This vet had a social conscience and believed that neutering and spaying helped pet overpopulation.  I wish there were more like him. I have yet to meet a vet in Burnaby that cares that much.",2023-12-13 06:19:01
AITA for taking my family friends dog to the groomers?: UPDATE,"Okay so I have an update! I was losing my mind the day they were set to return. I literally thought I was going to have a heart attack or stroke. My wife was with me and feeling the same. Everytime we heard a car go by we thought it was them and our stomach would drop. 

Well, the husband came to pick up the dog. He let us know that first off he was grateful that we watched their dog but his wife was upset mostly because our mutual friend who knows more of their family than we do told them before we did. They were upset that we didn’t tell them directly and I guess he was causing some drama by voicing his own thoughts and opinions on the situation and talking to other family members. He didn’t explain much more than that summary though. 

Also, my friends are not the original dog owner. The dog belonged to one of their brothers who had a financial snafu which resulted in him having to work 10+ hours and he couldn’t take the best care of his dog. So he asked them to temporarily take care of the dog. Well, it’s been about a year later and here we are.

So, I think our mutual friend talking to them and the family caused a majority of the drama for the friends. I don’t know what was said but that’s what I’m assuming. 

Also, he brought up the reason why they didn’t get him groomed is because apparently the vet told them not to because of the ear infection. Which first I think is weird, you can get a dog washed with cotton balls in their ears or not get the head and ears wet. I just don’t understand the reasoning a vet would say that when they can clearly see the matting on the dog. Second, the ear infection took like 2-3 months to be resolved which again to me seems like an outrageous time for an ear infection to be resolved but I’m not a doctor or veterinarian. 

The husband mostly just said we can talk about it some other time. Took the dog and that was really it. The wife did not come out to talk to us. 

It’s clearly been a few days/weeks since this interaction and they haven’t brought it up again. We’ve seen them a few times since then. It seems like they’re dealing with something else that’s moved them away from the dog drama. 

The biggest issue is now every time we see them the dog goes bonkers and every time we try to leave or walk away the dog tries to follow us. My wife and I cringe every time that happens because we know this kills the wife and probably bothers her to no end.

Also, if someone can send me a source on how to add photos let me know so y’all can see him after his haircut.

Should I let my 3y/o Poodle be with us when we put our old Yorkie to sleep?,"My 3 year old Poodle is the most active and loving pup in the world (I know I'm her mom but still, she is) I got her during the Pandemic when I was living alone in a different city for work. I ended up moving back home with my parents when my puppy was around 6 months old and she adapted really quickly to the new house and to our 13 year old Yorkie, who's the undisputed master of the house. 
The thing is, my parents' Yorkie has never been too social, she's actually really snappy and not too loving to anyone but my parents, my sister and me. My puppy understood this from the beginning and just got our of her way since they met and our Yorkie became the Alpha in the pack, I joke all the time saying that my poodle came to our oldie to give her energy and ruined her retirement. The truth is my poodle is very respectful of her ""superior"" she's never even sniffed her things, let alone got close to her, there is a lot of respect there and a clear boss. 
My beautiful sister, our Yorkie, Lola has to be put to sleep tomorrow because her little 3.9lbs body can't move anymore, can't walk and can't even go potty, we all made the decision as a family and we made the appointment with her vet for her to come to our house tomorrow and do the procedure where she's most comfortable. I've read and heard that the other dog in the house can benefit from being there and smells their pal when they're gone. 
I guess I'm asking if anyone has gone through this and that's okay, my puppy is so happy and lively I'm scared she can become depressed or sad, but if she's not there I'm worried she won't know her alpha just up and left. 
As I know a lot of you understand I'm completely heartbroken but any advice?",2023-12-13 01:05:46
AITA- just kidding. is it selfish to move across the ocean and take your cat with you?,"My mother is a wonderful woman who loves animals. She's the whole reason why I have such a huge love and adoration for our wildlife and our domestic pets too.

Recently I have been discussing things with my partner in Australia and we have decided that I'm going to get a tourist visa and move over there for an extended holiday (and hopefully bridge over to a partner visa at some point). I told my mother about this and she was very unhappy at first, but then she came to me a day later and was somewhat chiller about it until she told me that I couldn't take my cat with me.

See, I live with her currently due to circumstances out of my control. She helps me pay for his litter and food costs, but we also have three other cats that love and adore her. My cat is particularly fond of me, though he loves everyone once he gets to know them, he is most comfortable with me.

She tells me that ""he's happy here, you shouldn't uproot him when he's happy."" and basically telling me it's selfish to do that to my cat without actually saying the word 'selfish'. Thing is, this is my cat. Not the family cat. Not her cat but MY cat. I took him home from the shelter, bonded with him, and have been the one constant thing in his life since he was 2 years old (he's 7 now!) and although I personally don't feel like it's selfish, my mother has always had a knack for making me feel selfish for putting myself first.

I finally sent her a long message basically telling her how I felt.

She responds with a short, curt message saying ""fine. Do whatever you want. He's your cat."" and that seems like a win but knowing my mother... it's her being catty.

TLDR ; AITA for wanting to take my cat with me to live with my romantic partner in a different country? We would be following all the rules to have him enter legally.  


EDIT: When i say she helps me payfor the litter, i meant she and i split the costs. I didn't mean literally helps me pay for it 24/7. Sheesh.",2023-12-13 00:01:32
Got bit by my vaccinated dog,"My dog tends to eat tissues and stuff so I try to snatch it from him so he won’t get sick or anything. Today I saw him trynna flee from me and into his tiny house so I checked and I saw him eating some plastic. I usually just take it and he never gets mad but this time he bit me when I reach for it. It was bleeding for some time then it stopped after I run it with water. I took a bath after cleaning it with soap.

He seemed very apologetic by running into me and checking on me. He seemed anxious like looking at me while keeping distance then putting his paws at me before running away again keeping distance. My dad also got bit years ago and he didnt take shots. Will I be fine?

Edit: IM FINE GUYS. Japan hasn’t had rabies for like tens of years now and we’re updated with all the shots that concerns our dog. Thanksies!!",2023-12-12 19:30:52
Cat went in for a dental and had 4 Teeth Extracted,"My lovely boy (about 6 years old) went in for a dental today. He was having some issues with a molar about a month ago and I took him into the vet. I noticed he was having issues because he was making distressed meows, his mouth was twitchy, his breath smelled, and he had dried saliva on the side of his mouth.

I kind of expected one tooth to be pulled, but apparently the vet noticed it had already fallen out when they did the examination today. They ended up pulling 4 more teeth (both upper fangs/canines and some others).

He is home now and coming down from the anesthesia and pain meds and I feel horrible. I'm trying to tell myself that I did the right thing. I don't know that he was having issues with the other teeth and I don't know if they needed to be pulled. This is my first pet and he's had surgery before, but never had to get any teeth pulled.


I don't know what I am looking for except to maybe ask if based on the information provided, if this was the right thing to do.

I had to put my cat down tonight after only having him for three weeks.,"
I adopted a ten year old cat from Canada three weeks ago that had kidney failure. His owner abandoned him in Winnipeg after learning he had kidney failure. 

I took him back to the US from the shelter and tried to give him the best life possible. He met my sister and her boyfriend, took rides in the car to see our town, had a nice soft bed with blankets and toys. 

Tonight, he had a stroke and I made the decision to put him out of his misery. I feel like such a failure, but I didn’t want him to suffer anymore.",2023-12-11 15:24:19
I feel guilty for locking my 4 month old kitten out of my room at night,"So I took my 4 month old female kitten , Salem home just under a week ago. She is a very sweet and cuddly girl , however because of her age , she’s extremely active , including during the night. The first few days , she was okay and slept in her bed next to mine , or on the end of my bed. I have her feedings scheduled , she gets LOTS of playtime throughout the day , but recently she’s been playing well into the night. I’m losing a lot of sleep because she’ll jump and meow till I’m awake so I can play with her. Today , I set her bed outside and her play toy , and closed the door , because I need my sleep , but I can hear her little meows and I feel so guilty. She’s very attached to me and she does have good days , but I can’t function with the lack of sleep I’m getting. I’m afraid she’ll get abandonment issues. What do I do ?

I’m the worst pet owner. What can I do?,"My cat passed away early last year, and I adopted a new kitten a month or two later. I come to find out half my family is allergic to new cat. I’m in the middle of buying a house too, and my offer gets accepted. 

My family’s allergies get worse despite me buying HEPA filters and allergy food for the kitten, who now ends up going to live with my grandparents until I close on my house. I buy food, litter, keep up with her vet care, and buy my grandparents little thank you gifts from me and kitty like a roomba, and ~$100 of assorted things they need. (Groceries, etc) Closing takes 5 months, and it’s hopefully this week. 

The house has ~ 3 holes in the Sheetrock and an exposed crawl space that needs to be covered. 2 x 3 opening there. 

My grandparents just messaged me saying my cat would be better off going to a nice family rather than live with me in an unsafe house. 

Idk how to respond to that message and now feel like the worst pet owner. I want to get a roommate that likes cats too, or maybe another cat. What are your thoughts?",2023-12-11 01:58:00
Why does my dog open my door? Just to walk away??,"My 1 yr old female cockerspaniel poodle mix has a common habit of pushing open my door, just to stand in the doorway silently waiting for my response only to walk away a minute or 2 later.

"[Atlanta] I am escaping Domestic violence and have my dog. I made it to Atlanta and a friend got me a train ticket to Oregon, but I couldn’t take my dog. I can’t find anyone to take her and I don’t know what to do. Does anyone have suggestions?","
I’ve asked every place I can think of and am running out of ideas. I sold my earrings for a little dog food and a hotel room for tonight so I can sleep and try to figure things out. 

She’s an Australian shepherd, lab and pit mix. Looks mostly like a pit bull, so I think that’s why I’m having issues. She’s as sweet as she can be.

I didn’t want my ex to hurt her and couldn’t bare the thought of leaving her behind and I worry I’ve made the wrong decision.

I can take the train tomorrow, but I can’t take her with me. I can’t afford to get a different ticket or to pay for her on each leg. It’d be almost $150 and I can’t manage that.

I need to figure out something, as if I miss my train again tomorrow, I’ll be completely screwed.

Of you can think of anything, please let me know.",2023-12-10 05:59:47
I cannot forgive myself for making the decision to have my cat PTS,"Basically the above. My beautiful boy was diagnosed with a cancer in his intestines that had spread. He lost a lot of weight rapidly and scans showed this when I took him for a check. Surgery wasn’t really viable due to the spread and as he found being at the vets so stressful, the vets didn’t advise chemo treatment as he would need to be knocked out weekly just to have it administered for maybe gaining an extra 6 months of life at most. So I made the decision to let him go. I was there with him and held him as he left me. The thing is, 7 months on and I still cannot come to terms with what I did. There is an emptiness in me that just won’t heal. Suddenly I go back to that moment and the grief and guilt is so overwhelming for me. If I cannot forgive myself, how could he forgive me for that choice? He was so happy to see me when I came in and it felt like a betrayal (he was so high on pain meds and seemed like his old self after a few bad days which didn’t help) 
Everyone including the vets tells me it was the best and kindest choice. It doesn’t feel like it. We went through so much together in 12 years and got through every time, I feel like I gave up on him this time. It haunts me. Is this normal? Will it change? Am I being stupid?",2023-12-10 05:41:45

My girl is going in for a geriatric spay. What to expect?,"Guys, I know. I feel like a terrible dog owner. I just fell on hard times, wasn’t working for a few years and couldn’t afford it. I also had zero clue pyometra existed, or else I would’ve have found a way to do it earlier. Anyways, she’s 8. She’s a very healthy girl, I did the preliminary blood panel and all is well. She’s scheduled for next Thursday. I am so, so worried for her. She’s very tough, and won’t she me she’s in pain. So, basically I’m worried they won’t give me good enough meds or enough. A spay is a serious surgery in my mind and I just want her to be comfy. I read online it can take 2 weeks or more to heal. How do I make her the most comfortable? Also, I’m worried about the car ride home. She’s too heavy for me to pick up. I imagine she shouldn’t jump, so what do I do? Thanks in advance.",2023-12-09 23:10:43
Cat hasn’t eaten in 6 days,"My 4 y/o cat won’t eat or drink water. I got him in to a vet on the 3rd day. I took him to a different vet on the 4th day. That night, upon returning home, he had seizure-like symptoms. I then took him to an ER where he spent the night and was given fluids and nutrients. He came home on the fifth day groggy from anesthesia for an MRI. Now it’s the 6th day (almost 7th now) and still nothing has changed.
At this point. 5 different doctors have looked at him. I’ve spent over $10k on every possible test/exam/medication. Everything points to him being healthy. The doctors are saying we’re at the end of the road as there’s no more tests that can be done. They think he may be suffering from vertigo, as his prevailing symptom is dizziness/drunkenness. But that doesn’t really explain why he won’t even drink water.
I think the only option left is to try a holistic doctor, but as it’s basically been a week, I’m beginning to lose hope and wonder if driving him to more doctors would only bring him more stress & fear. 
I can’t even imagine not having my guy around, but I’m honestly beginning to wonder if the kinder action would be to relieve him of his misery, rather than watching him actually starve himself.",2023-12-09 15:23:36

Dog still throwing up after anesthesia,"I took my dog to my local humane society yesterday to get spayed, they gave her the anesthesia and she started vomiting (I withheld food and water starting at 10pm the night before scheduled surgery as instructed) so they didn't perform the spay. I was given some medication for her to take with her dinner and asked to come back the next day so they could try again.

It's now been about 18-19 hours since she was given anesthesia and she cannot keep anything in her stomach. She's been sleeping most of the day and everytime she wakes up she throws up until she falls back to sleep again. They said that some vomiting was normal after the anesthesia but is this amount normal? I've offered her food and water, she had a little bit that I hand fed her with the medication, but didn't keep that down either. 

She will not get up from where she is laying down anymore, I can't rouse her with food, affection, anything. She hasn't wanted to go outside to potty at all since before the anesthesia. At what point do I take her to the emergency vet? 

Please help me, she's 16 months old, I thought I did everything right and it would kill me to lose her because of this.",2023-12-08 19:39:43
Is it selfish to have a pet cat when I’m not financially stable?,"Hi, I managed to rescue a kitten from a dumpster while I was finishing my shift. Without thinking for long, I decided to keep the kitten even though I don’t have any experience with having a pet before (I do like cats though, been wanting to have a pet cat someday when I’m financially better). However, I’ve become really close with the kitten and it seems like the kitten likes me too. He had with eating but I’ve tried buying different brand of soft foods until I found the one that he likes. I also give him MKR and he seems so much healthier (chubbier) than the first time we met. I’m thinking about keeping him, but financially, I’m making just enough with my wages. I do buy a lot of pet stuffs for him, it just I haven’t been able to go to vet yet as I don’t know how much it’s gonna cost. Should I keep the kitten or give it away? I’m scared I might not be able to provide for the cat :(",2023-12-08 14:31:59
Altercation with neighbor. Just an overall bizarre experience.,"Today I was walking my dog. He's on a 6ft leash with a knot tied halfway in order to make it shorter when held with two hands (one hand on the knot and the other around the loop at the very end of leash). Please keep in mind that Little Fido likes to wonder on grass and is one of those dogs that needs constant reinforcement to keep skills and remember boundaries.

  
We turn the corner to walk back home where I'm a little ahead of Fido. He isn't at my side. I momentarily lose track of where he is and in the corner of my eye I see him wander towards two garbage bins on one of my neighbor's lawn. Both bins are less than five feet away from the sidewalk. I catch Fido, walk towards him to get him away from the bins, pulling on the leash. Too late. Neighbor is standing at the door yelling. He marches towards us.

  
""Get off my lawn! He was going to piss on my lawn!""

  
I say no he wasn't. He pissed about 20 minutes ago and was just sniffing. I was pulling him away.

  
""Well he was gonna piss on my lawn! Get off my property!""

  
My dog and I are on the sidewalk.

  
""Where do you live? I'm gonna find your house! How do you like if I shit on your lawn?!""

  
Fido never shitted on his lawn.

  
I exchanged some not nice words. (I shouldn't have but I did.) The man gets in my face and claps his hands in my face, threatening physically assault after I said he did shit on my lawn that I have cameras. He then again says he wants to shit on my lawn.

  
He's pushing 6ft and 200lbs. I'm not 6ft and not 200lbs.

  
Eventually he got tired of yelling and walks back, still yelling at me. I spot a Virgin Mary statue on his lawn and ask if he was \*Catholic. He turns around and says, ""I'm the Devil!"" I laugh.

  
Fido and I walk back home.

  
I realize I could've acted much, much better by just walking away and saying nothing. That didn't happen. I'm just happy he didn't kick Fido or spit on me/Fido.

Is my dog actually allergic to chicken?,"So we have a dog that originally we were just dog sitting while the mom took care of her kid and did her errands (husband was away for the military) and wrote us a list of do’s and don’ts for the dog. The one that was written in big letters was “DO NOT FEED HIM CHICKEN! HE CAN DIE!” So my family and I did everything to keep table scraps away from him, especially chicken. Fast forward a couple months and we are his new owners (mom had to move across the country where husband was stationed and the dog, Chase, had gotten so attached to us she didn’t want him to suffer the plane ride and leaving just to constantly keep moving) and while figuring out his diet and treats, my grandpa or uncle got him treats that said “100% real chicken” as an ingredient (I think from a vet) and Chase has been gobbling them up with no issues.

So….was it just a mistake on her part and maybe she gave him some bad chicken? Or is it the way the treat is made? Or is it possible a certain amount that has a negative effect?",2023-12-07 23:36:58
Friend wants a pet monkey. Advice on how to discourage it?,"My friend, ""Anna"" (26f) wants a pet baby macaque monkey because she has seen those videos on youtube where they feed them and bathe them etc and she says they are absolutely adorable. I've been telling her that monkeys are bad pets and they don't belong in someones house but she won't listen. 

She keeps saying ""The ones on youtube look happy, healthy and calm"". Its frustrating because I don't want to sound too harsh. She won't believe me when I say that the monkeys in the videos are caged all the time and only come out for videos. She has been messaging various sellers on facebook but hasn't actually purchased one yet.

Another problem is that we live in the UK and there was talk of tighter restrictions of owning primates. She would never be able to meet the requirements but she is so stuck in her fantasy world she won't listen to that either.

Is there anything I can show her or anything else I can say? or should I give up and leave her to it?

I think it's extremely unhygienic and I'm actually very surprised it's allowed.  I don't mind a dog in a pub that does not do food but places that do food dogs shouldn't be allowed.  I have been in a few places now where I am trying to eat and a dog on the next table is begging me for food .

Euthanasia regrets.,"My dog Steve died on Friday 1st December 2023 evening, one day after his gastric tube surgery. Steve was only 7 yrs 9month old. 

He vomited multiple times on 19th Nov, I took him to see local Vet twice that week, got worse so went to other Vets with scan facility available on Saturday the 25th Nov and ruled out obstruction, and had cerenia injection. He was still not better so I called them on Monday 27th Nov they offered me 1. I could go back or 2. refer Steve to specialist vet. I agreed for specialist referral so on the same day he's been admitted into specialist clinic.

Specialist diagnosed him with oesophagitis - inflammation of the food pipe. With megaesophagus- abnormal enlargement of the food pipe. Which can lead to higher risk of aspiration pneumonia due to regurgitation (food retention in the food pipe and throw up causing pneumonia). After Wednesday specialists suggest PEG tube surgery (inserting a feeding tube to the stomach) as he was still regurgitating often. So he was transferred to another specialist branch for the surgery on Thursday 30th Nov. 

on Thursday the originally planned Endoscopy insertion of PEG tube was not successful they called me and explain that because his stomach location was in the rib cage so the tube can't go thru between ribs. They suggested open surgery to pull stomach down to the abdomen, stitch it there and place a tube after. Which I said okay to proceed if that's a safer way to put feeding tube in his case. He then had two procedures back to back on Thursday.

they called me Friday 1st Dec morning saying that he was stable overnight and they been feeding via tube 4 hourly and stomach fluid drained regularly. But he regurgitated again in the morning and he was aggressive to staff so they sedated him again and want to discharge him early for me to better look after him at home(they knew Im a registered nurse for human). They initially asked me to pick up from the surgery branch I said I could not as I was still at work but I can try find time to leave early to pick him up from nearer branch.

I arrived at 2:30pm on Friday expecting to pick him up but only to find a very unresponsive unwell looking Steve with a visibly very swollen abdomen. 

He looked so uncomfortable, breathing with a wet rattling sound that's commonly seen in palliative patients. The vet that saw me said Steve was not well when he was transferred to them from the surgery branch, she repeated his bloods and the results were showing renal failure and noticing his abdomen was swollen she suggested doing US and found no bladder and a lot of fluid in his abdomen. 

He further deteriorated and became more unstable, constantly heart rates were above 155 and hard to keep his BP up. Oxygen sats dropping 91-94 then down to 78-80 last seen on monitor. He was under intensive care and receiving IV epinephrine, ketamine, lignocaine and fentanyl IV. He looked to me that his body was in shock and shutting down. By night time almost after 8.30pm they confirmed that he had a ruptured bladder, the evening vet came in and talk to me about surgery to fix this but she also said he's very unstable so there's a chance he might have a cardiac arrest before waiting for surgery, or even during surgery. That's when I made the hardest most painful decision in my life to euthanize him. 

Since his death, I could not sleep I kept rethinking every step leading up to his death and then it came back to the thought that what if I didn't choose to euthanize him and let him have a chance for surgery and see if he could have survived.  I was there since 2:30pm and by the time he was euthanized was already closer to 11pm. I was too tired to think and I felt that I made the wrong decision to euthanize him. 

I also couldn't forgive myself letting him go thru so many days of hospital stay and struggles. Why didn't I take him back to local vet, why did I choose this specialist clinic.. why did I agree for him to have the gastrotomy surgery when they called me.. why there was no urine output monitored.. why did they sedated him further without examinations.. he couldn't speak so he could only tell he was in pain thru aggression..he was fighting for his life alone..why did they try to discharge him early.. why didn't I challenge them when they called me. why didn't I speak up..

I've been struggling, crying, wailing every day since Steve's death on Friday. He was my soulmate, my home, my only family in New Zealand. I'm still crying at the moment writing this.

Update edit: many thanks to all your kind messages.. I really needed them to get me thru hour by hour. I've made some progress in accepting Steve's death..and understanding the hurt come from how much love there is between us over the past 8yrs. big hugs everyone 🫂

Update edit 2 - 14/12/23
I'm still struggling...it still hurts so much. I cry in the morning, cry at work during lunch time and between patients, cry before I drive home, when I arrive home from work there's this suffocating hollowing aches in my chest crushing me down. I miss Steve so much I could die. Part of me is already dying. I've been considering suicide on and off. Everything is pointless now. I can't stand when people around me suggesting getting another dog. I just want to reunite with Steve. I don't want anyone else.. I'm really struggling to stay alive...

"Cat missing in the house, any suggestions?","UPDATE!!!! 

We adopted a new cat recently, she’s a beautiful black cat with long hair and she’s a little over a year old. 

Our apartment is small so we decided to introduce her to the living room first. She hid under the couch which I expected her to do. 

She’s been there a few days, and I slide her fancy feast, and she comes out to use the litter box when we aren’t in the room. 

Well last night we had to put up our new tv after the old one broke. I was pretty worried we would scare her. She stayed under the couch and the last time I saw her was at midnight last night. 

I wokeup this morning and she’s gone. Our apartment is only 650 square feet so we have torn it apart. We even flipped the couch and cut into the liner to see if she crawled in there. 

I didn’t leave the house anytime after I saw her, my bf didn’t leave anytime after I saw her, so we know there’s literally no way she could have gotten outside. 

We’ve checked behind the washer and dryer, in the Christmas tree, under and in between furniture, it’s insane. 

She’s microchipped, but I don’t know how that will help if she’s lost in the house. They could just say yea she’s inside like thanks we already knew that. 

I’ve had abused kitties before who take a long time to get adjusted but never a Houdini cat. I’m getting really worried so any suggestion would really help me.

We have a lot of pets and its ruining our finances,"My fiance is a vet tech and is also a bleeding heart. Meaning she can't say not to taking in an animal. Currently we have (16) animals.

I worry that my fiance will not part with the animals until it gets to a point to where we could lose our home. I have spoken to her about it but she does not seem to understand where I am coming from. 

Animals:

* 4 large dogs
* 6 goats
* 1 paralyzed goat
* 3 ferrets
* 1 blue tongue skink

Why Do A Lot Of Dog Owners Not Respect The Physical Boundaries Of Others With Their Dog?,"I’ve never liked dogs. Sue me. Almost anyone I tell that to looks at me like I have ten heads, but they’re just not my thing for many different reasons. They’re loud, they require attention, they shed, they smell, etc. I’d never own one for that and the financial reasons as well. My big issue is the owners who will let their dog lick you, smell you, and invade your personal space like it’s nothing. It’s not the dog’s fault. They’re just doing what they know. I find it so aggravating when they just let them invade your space when I’m clearly not digging it and say nothing and then *I* look like the asshole to say something. And I hate the excuses like, “Oh, he just has to sniff you,” like yeah, I don’t care the reason. I don’t want him that close to me. If you’re at someone’s house and their toddler is jumping all up on you, licking, and sniffing you, everyone will agree that you’re within your rights to want them
to stop and the parent will immediately stop them and chastise them for their behavior, explaining that’s not how we behave towards guests. When it comes to dogs, you’re just forced to accept it for some reason though. Human or not, I want my personal space.",2023-12-05 10:06:53
[Help] why is my dog suddenly deathly scared of my room?,"First, I want to say a few things for context. My dogs name is Chloe and she is an 8 year old female German shorthair pointer. She has always been very skiddish and scared of a few things. Chloe has always loved my room, if she could stay there for the rest of her life she would. She loves to snuggle with me and loves to sleep in my bed to the point where she would growl at me if I tried to move her.

As of yesterday (I'm pretty sure it started the day before yesterday but I didn't really realize it then), she has been scared shitless of my room. She won't lay on my bed anymore and she will shake like a leaf. Before she started all of this, I did have some lights hanged up that fell as well as some prints on my wall that fall which caused noises which she didn't like. However normally Chloes desire to lay with me beats the fear of the noise. So I took down the lights and prints and had her sniff them. She seems uninterested in them and not scared of them. Now I'm noticing that she is staring at one corner of the room. That is the corner that scares her is what I thought. I did move a beam bag that was in that spot that I moved but that wouldn't be the reason since she never cared for that bean bag anyway. I also moved my file cabinet on wheels to the corner. I thought it could be that but I was wrong. 
I want to be patient and give her patience but the fact that she used to love my room and not want to leave and now this, is heartbreaking. And she could be having a health problem that is making her act this why so I'm scared and beyond confused of what it may be that's scaring her this bad. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",2023-12-05 08:43:55
Critter Depot suggests freezing baby chicks alive,"
 An on-line store Critter Depot that sells feeders for reptiles also sells live baby chicks for snakes. In their description, they suggest freezing live chicks to prevent them from growing.

It will prevent them from growing too large for your snake to consume”. I asked them to change the description but they are not responding. Does anyone know where I can leave a bad review for them?

why are cages cruel to dogs and cats but not other pets?,"shower thought: why is crating a dog or a cat considered cruel, when no one bats an eye at smaller animals, insects, birds, reptiles, etc. being confined? they're let out to roam and engage and be loved on, but ultimately, they are enclosed in some way, shape, or form when the pet owner isnt able to keep eyes on them or ensure their safety. and everyone is fine with this. why is that?",2023-12-05 04:33:47
Mom doesn’t give dog water so it doesn’t pee in the house,"Just some backstory for context, I live at home with my mom and we have 2 dogs, one bigger in size (dalmatian) and one smaller in size (chihuahua). We are unsure of the chihuahua’s age as she was a rescue off the street, but she’s at the age where she is unable to hold it in as well as my other dog who is younger. She pees on the potty-training pads but sometimes she will miss it and pee on the floor, typical old dog behavior.

Ever since we moved into a our new apartment a year ago, my mom has been conscious of how much water the chihuahua has been drinking as we have carpet and she has peed on it from time to time. Her solution? Limiting her water intake to once a day. 
Instead of leaving a bowl out and refilling it throughout the day she will give the dog water once in the morning for breakfast and never again unless I do it. It has gotten to the point that she is counting how many licks of water the dog takes (50). She works two jobs so I understand that she is tired and has limited time to walk them, so I have taken up the responsibility of walking them and taking them outside to go to the bathroom.
I’ll provide an example of an interaction I had yesterday that influenced me to post here.

Yesterday I come home from work at 4:30 PM and put the bowl of water out for the dogs to drink from. They hadn’t gotten any water since 6:00 AM. When my mom hears them drinking water she immediately says to me “it is too late in the day for you to be giving them water” 
I respond “you haven’t given them water all day” 
My Mom: “Yes I did I gave them water this morning”
Me: “You don’t understand that that’s not enough water for an animal to last all dat”
My Mom: “You don’t understand that you’re ignorant, i’m the one that takes care of the dogs in this house.”

All my mom does is feed them and take them out to pee when they eat breakfast and dinner. 
That’s it. 
So instead of taking the dogs out on a regular basis, she lets the chihuahua have 50 licks of water a day and that’s it.

TL;DR
Mom gives our old chihuahua water once a day and counts how many licks of water she takes so that she doesn’t pee on the floor/carpet. ",2023-12-04 19:33:09
My cat of 12 years died and the vet blamed me,"Hello, looking for a little insight here and hopefully some closure. My cat Gracie died 3 years ago. She was 12 years old. She started showing signs of weight loss, lethargic behavior, and vomiting. This all happened in a span of a week. The first time she threw up and started drinking a ton I wish I would have just taken her to the vet. Instead I waited a couple days… The last day of her life was really tough. She could hardly stand up and wouldn’t drink a thing. I took her in immediately and after the vet came in after seeing her he rushed into the office and in a stern voice said “what did you do to her”. I am crying as I write this because the guilt that I feel to this day is so extremely heavy. It haunts me every day. 
He told me that her body temperature was very low and that he needed to put her down because she was in pain. To this day I don’t know what happened. That day was a blur, I lost my best friend and I felt like the doctor blamed me. Can somebody who has medical knowledge tell me if there was anything more I could have done.",2023-12-04 06:22:40
Growing up with a cat that was so incredibly loyal,"This cat would never want to escape my side. Anytime I'd come home from school growing up, he'd always be waiting on my bed, and anytime we moved, he'd memorize which bed I slept in. He would always want to pet, would purr all the time, almost no anger in him. Then one day, I came home from school, and I found him dead on my bed. He was waiting for me, he had no pain, he was an elderly cat. He never wanted to leave my side, and he was the best cat in the whole world. It was 6 years ago he passed, and I will miss him forever...",2023-12-04 02:30:36
resident cat HATEFUL after new kitten rescue...,"so for the past two years i have had my cat, thunderbeam. she has been my #1 and she has usually always lived alone minus about ~6 months where i lived with my ex and his roommate with their 2 cats. thunderbeam took a while to get used to them, but she eventually came around.

she's always been a scared, shy, nervous cat. it's just how she is, and i do my best to care for her through any stressful moments to the best of my ability.

however, today... it's been below freezing outside—mid to low 20s—and there was a momma with babies outside these past few days! when figuring out what to do, we decided since no one was claiming the ownership of the cats that we would do our best to rescue one little guy and brought him inside (the rest as of today weren't with the momma so i'm hoping someone else took them inside!)

we placed him in the bathroom and thats where he has been ever since, a couple hours.

the problem is this: thunderbeam hates me and my husband now. it's so depressing: she is hissing at us, growling, and refusing any contact since we touched the baby.

i don't want to lose MY baby, but i also do not want to put this kitten back outside or concern myself with shelters. what can we do???

i want them to live, at the very least, together without thunderbeam hating HER life. this little kitten loves anything and everything, so i'm not worried about him like that lol.

please let me know what methods i can use to make them both as comfortable as possible.

it's also important to NOTE: i am actually unsure of the sex of the kitten, i will double check but i am using ""he"" as a placeholder.

thank you so much!",2023-12-04 00:50:59
I tamed a cat that everyone believed was unloving,"A few years ago my family had a cat give birth and I found a home for all the kittens except the runt.

I raised her from a baby and always made sure she had everything a kitty could want, but as soon as she could run she ran from everyone.
From the start of her life she sort of acted like a feral cat? Not aggressive or anything but she absolutely hated people and would not let anyone get close to her, we almost believed she got out of the house somehow because of how little we saw her and no matter what my family did they couldn't get close to her at all.

It was really strange because I've raised a lot of kitties throughout my life and none have acted as skiddish as she did, I had her since she was born so she didn't have any trauma, but she sort of acted that way. 
I couldn't seem to get her to be comfortable around me for about 2 years, but when I got more time to try to make contact with her I very very slowly started to make progress.
Honestly after the first year I had kind of lost faith a little bit that she would ever be a cat that you could pet or really see but she proved me wrong. 

I sort of had to corner her and just sit with her for hours giving treats and letting her smell me at a distance and after months and months she started to let me pet her briefly. I thought that was as far as she would progress but she surprised me again and again. It's been about a year and a half since she started getting closer to me and now she is one of the most affectionate cats I've ever seen.

She absolutely loves cuddles and attention and often meows and walks around my feet when she sees me, it makes me so incredibly happy. 
Though she to this day only lets me get near her, she acts the same skiddish way with the rest of the family. They love animals and were always kind to her. 
It always confused me why such a loving cat is so afraid.

Advice on paraplegic kitten,"Today I found a kitten on the sidewalk, about a month old or so. She can't move her back legs. Took her to the vet, got x ray. It revealed that she had a fracture that healed but it didn't heal right. She also seems to have an hernia. She can't pee on her own and has to be stimulated to do so. Poop I'm not sure yet, she did while I was petting her but she didn't try to use the littler box, I don't know if she has bowel control. I've never had a special needs pet and I'd really appreciate some advice. I don't even know what to ask you guys, I feel lost. I'll check for a second opinion on monday, and I'm thinking of getting her a wheelchair. I guess what worries me right now is all the cleaning, keeping her and her space clean. Can you tell me about your experiences if you have any?",2023-12-03 10:04:00
Should my friend ask for financial help for medical expenses from adoptee?,"My friend just took on her neighbor's dog.  His wife died, he was moving to another state, and couldn't take his big dog with him.  He said she (the dog) was 5 or 6, had her for a couple of years.  My friend was hesitant to take on another dog.  Her dog had died 2 years ago, then earlier this year was stuck helping her brother in law by taking his dog.  THAT dog was diagnosed with cancer within the month, and died a few weeks later.  My friend really didn't want another dog with no time to live (she's not a dog hospice).  The neighbor knew all of this history and assured her the dog was fine.

3 weeks later and a visit to the vet, my friend spends $2000 and discovers there are 3 masses that need to be biopsied and elevated liver enzymes that will need to be medicated...that the neighbor knew about because it's the same vet, and the vet told my friend that the neighbor was told this months before he gave up the dog.

I suggested she ask the neighbor (who now lives in another state) for some money to help with the medical costs of his (former) sick dog that he gave away without disclosing all of her health issues.  Do you think this is the right thing to do?  Are there laws or anything protecting adopters from private adoptees getting sick animals?",2023-12-03 06:07:01
About to be homeless with my two dogs,"I have had a rough year. I hurt my back and herniated two disks and have permanent pain and nerve damage. I could not walk for over a month. I got behind on rent. I pawned what I had to get bus fare to get to the spine specialist halfway across the state. I don't have a license I can't see that well and don't feel comfortable behind the wheel anymore. My back will only get worse. I finally got my life back in order and was working my ass off at two jobs one full time and one part time without a car and without any days off. I always worked somewhere. I finally was about to send a big rent payment when I got paid. Literally the day before get paid I found a notice stating my month to month lease is being terminated. I have to be out by the first of Nov. I begged my landlord to please reconsider since I was able to pay him and then some now. He said no he's going to remodel the apartment and he doesn't want dogs. My dogs are service dogs for my PTSD and panic attacks. I love them with all my heart and they are my family. I owe my life to my dogs. Without them I would be nothing. I begged for more time and he agreed to give me till halfway through November. I looked and looked and applied to every place I could find. I make plenty of money and I still can't find any place to stay. I don't know what to do. I'm still in my apartment just waiting to be kicked out and it's December. It's so stressful I can't sleep. I try to be optimistic but it's honestly looking like I can get rid of my dogs and stay warm and comfy in a motel or something or being homeless with my dogs and possibly not be able to hold down a job because I have nowhere to leave my dogs. There's no question in my mind I'll never leave them behind I promised them. I will be homeless again in the middle of winter here about to snow soon. I can't get a car to live in cause I can't get my license. I love my family and will be homeless for them

Edit update:
Thank you everyone for the wonderful words of support. I thank you all for taking time out of your life to care about someone who you don't even know. I am an outcast. I don't fit in I am truly disabled I have autism (I am truly only a 9-12 year old in my mind I just act normal because when I was younger I was told nobody wants children with autism which is true I spent 6-7 years in group homes/orphanages), ADHD, PTSD, severe social anxiety and panic attacks. I could not even live life at all. I was scared to leave  my house. I could not function and my dogs work wonders for me. I finally feel like I can be myself because my dogs love is unconditional they love me for me. My bigger dog is trained to warn me of an incoming panic attack/PTSD episode and helps me calm down and ground myself. My bigger dog has also been trained to respond to commands and help me walk since my back injury. My dog kinda pulls me up hills with the harness handle. My small dog is my teddy bear cause he loves hugs and to be cuddled. He also is trained to warn and help with my episodes and he calms me down faster most of the time. I've had these dogs since they were puppies and I started them early on the service dog training. They are trained not to ever bear their teeth unless commanded. My dogs are love bugs they don't even wait to sniff people they just want the pets. It kinda weirds people out. So they play a vital role in my life without them I would probably be on disability and a scared shut in with agoraphobia. 

I have a update on my situation though. I have got my credit score up enough to get a home loan and buy a house. I may still be homeless for a while but eventually I will have a house with a big yard or maybe someday a giant piece of land for all the strays and unwanted animals can live in peace and happiness. Again thank you all it's good to know there are still good people out there. 

Much love to everyone for love is the key to true happiness",2023-12-02 11:48:22
Alternatives to pet ownership,"I've realized that I'm the only one in my house who wants pets, so because I was outnumbered, we're a petless family. Have been one ever since my dog passed away. Because of this, I would need to find alternatives, and going to the zoo can only do so much. I live around NYC, home to four of the top zoos and aquariums in the northeast, but you wouldn't get the warm cuddly connection you would with a pet. I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I've considered visiting the local petting zoo, as they have a house full of small mammals like guinea pigs which you're free to handle. Problem is it's closed until April. What else should I consider? Is there another outlet which works for you?",2023-12-02 11:10:34
Was this visit to the emergency vet justified?,"I came home late from work and my 8 month old cat didn’t get up to greet me like he normally would. I noticed that something was wrong immediately because he had his fur all puffed up, his eyes were glazed over, and he was low in energy. Some time went by and then he started throwing up, and also pooped on the floor. He just looked miserable.

At around midnight, I decided to take him to the emergency vet. He had a 104.8 degree fever and so the vet told us they wanted to keep him overnight to run some tests. He was on fluids to try to get his fever down but it persisted throughout the night. 

The next day they decided to give him some antibiotics and within a few hours, his fever broke and he was able to come home. They never found anything wrong with him except that he had elevated white blood cell count. 

The bill was outrageous ($3300) for the overnight stay, X-ray, ultrasound, bloodwork, etc. I didn’t have pet insurance so we had to pay this in full. I thought that nothing would happen since we have strictly indoor cats. We now have pet insurance after this experience. 

I am wondering if I should have waited til the morning to take him to a regular vet, or if taking him in immediately was the right thing to do? I was just scared he would have worsened overnight.",2023-12-02 05:10:31
Can I call animal control on my neighbor?,"UPDATE:

I have called the county and was advised to submit a complaint through the county portal with as much info and pictures as possible. So I’ve done that and will keep my fingers crossed!



My neighbor is a disabled elderly woman who has admitted she can not care for her dog. Her children come by a few times a week to help with him but that’s about it. 

The dog lives outside 24/7. He has no shelter and roams the backyard. From 5am-midnight, the dog howls. Constantly howling and wailing. 

He also escapes her yard frequently and ends up in my yard. She has told us that he is fine around humans but he has KILLED smaller dogs. I have a 3 legged chihuahua and I can’t leave him unattended in our yard because I never know if the neighbor dog will come over. He dug a hole under our fence and when we filled it in, he just started climbing/jumping over the fence. He is a huge dog. 

Is it okay to call animal services? What would even happen? Beyond the safety issue to my own dog and the lack of peace from the all day howling….that dog can not be okay living outside 24/7 and without any shelter. It’s rainy, it’s cold, I never see him interacting with any humans. That has to be some kind of abuse or cruelty.",2023-12-01 22:38:53
What to do about stray cats,"So we bought our first home in Sept and when we bought the home the old owners (friends) told us after the sale that the home comes with two stray cats that they have been feeding for about two years. Long story short the cats were indoor outdoor cats of a person down the street that is now in prison, and the old home owners we bought from decided to feed them. We talked to the lawyer of the person down the street and he doesn't have any solutions. Well now we have a puppy here and it's becoming ww3 with the stray male cat. We called one of the animal centers and they said they would only take the cat if it was an indoor cat. We don't know if it would be a good inside cat as I am deathly allergic to cats and with the puppy there is no way the cats are coming inside. Any advice what to do?

I'm about to give up on rescues,"My significant other and I have been applying to rescues for the past 2 or so months. We're looking for a small dog to add to our family, not a puppy, but not very elderly either. We own our house, make good money, and have a fenced-in backyard. We've checked at the local animal shelter, and they have had no small dogs that we have seen, only medium and larger sized breeds. We've applied to many dogs, usually getting no response, occasionally getting a response that the dog has been adopted. We have our application ""accepted"" to be eligible for adoption, but they always choose others over us. We've only been invited to meet a dog twice and haven't gotten to the ""home visit"" stage.

The local rescue we've focused most of our efforts on seems to only adopt to older couples... They post on their social media when they adopt a dog and I haven't seen anybody selected that was younger than say 40 years old, perhaps they're looking for retired folks who can spend all day at home with their dog. Maybe we're being too choosy, but our experience trying to adopt from rescues has been frustrating. We're considering looking at breeders.",2023-12-01 05:25:51

I'm feeling horrible after my my dogs dental work.,Just picked up my dog from the vet who had some teeth pulled.  I noticed some of her upper incisors were loose some brushing one day.   Decided that she needed to go to the vet and have it checked.  Her appointment was today and they ended up pulling both her bottom and top incisors.  I don't believe her bottom ones were loose but maybe they figured they were.  Now her tongue is hanging out a bit since theres no teeth keeping them in.   She was still drowsy from the anesthesia and not feeling herself.  I know it's from the anesthesia but I can't help feeling horrible that she got her teeth taken out.  I was trying to do the right thing and hopefully prevent something worse from happening with her mouth.  She's a malitipoo and I think they are prone to having dental issues.

Frustration with shelters and rescues - from a foster side of things,"Arbitrary adoption requirements for shelters are genuinely infuriating - from a foster perspective

I’m reposting this here because it just sat in r/dogs for a week without being approved 

So I’m on the other end of this from the usual complaints - I’m not looking to adopt (from a breeder or shelter or otherwise). Instead, I foster animals.

The increase in arbitrary, USELESS requirements for animal adoptions is driving me absolutely insane.

I’ve taken in 12 cats (1 adult, 11 kittens) and 5 puppies in the last 6 months. Shelters? Full. Fosters? Full. Homes open for adoption? Packed. Streets? I’m literally tripping on animals.

I ended up having to call around to SIX different local foster organizations and shelters after I found a dumped kitten and just didn’t have the space for it with prior placements.

But I just pulled up one of these organizations web pages. And the adoption requirements are UNREAL for an area that’s literally begging for fosters to take in placements.

For one, 4 month old puppy they want - it to be indoor only (valid), a fenced in backyard (less valid - I don’t even have one, we do regular walks instead and my dog gets way more exercise that way vs simply letting her out), a meet in greet (in the home, valid) TWO PERSONAL NON RELATIVE REFERENCES, and a vet reference ffs.

Meanwhile I’m having to send animals out of state, keeping different sets of animals in different rooms, and having up to a 60 day weight for a permanent foster placement for adoption (with PUPPIES and KITTENS)

I can’t tell you how many amazing placements I’ve had with people who don’t meet those standards. It’s also part of the reason that backyard breeders still have a business - cash changed hands with 0 questions asked. And they wonder why they’re having trouble finding enough fosters with enough space to take every animal in.",2023-11-30 12:19:46
Update on my roommate who kicked my injured cat out,"A lot of you were saying it sounds like my roommate's pitbull killed my cat, Willow. Didn't want to believe it but I straight up asked my roommate if she was being honest and she completely broke down and told me what actually happened. Turns out she downplayed just how bad Harvey (her dog) injured Willow. Initially she told me it was just one bite but she admitted Harvey bit her several times before my roommate could do anything. The last bite was so aggressive that my roommate had to physically pull Willow out of Harvey's mouth. Harvey also bit my roommate's arm during all of this but she's been wearing long sleeves so I hadn't seen it. She apparently had to tussle quite a bit with Harvey to get him to let Willow go. My roommate said that by this time Willow wasn't moving at all. She wrapped her in plastic bags and threw her in the dumpster behind our apartment building like a piece of fucking trash. I haven't had it in me to look at the body and confirm that it's her, but a couple of friends who knew Willow were with me during the confrontation with my roommate and offered to go look in the dumpsters, and they confirmed for me. It sounds like my roommate did what she could to protect Willow during the altercation but the fact that she lied to me about her death is fucking unforgivable. I've had Willow since she was a baby and she's been with me for almost 10 years. I don't even know what to do with myself right now. I don't feel safe staying with her and the dog. The worst part is knowing how long and fucking *painful* her death probably was. I knew she was getting older but I always imagined that she'd go in a peaceful way surround by people who loved her. I feel so sick that I wasn't there for her.

Thank you to everyone who left kind words and suggestions in my original post. I feel gutted but I wanted to make sure you guys had an update.

My Cat Was Such a Jerk,"

…and I loved her so very much. 

She came to live with me when she was wayyy too young to be away from her mom, but she was in a bad situation of animal hoarding and neglect; her litter mates were disappearing and I’d fallen in love with her on first sight. I rescued her and bonded with her and moved across the country with her.

She was with me through my struggles with infertility, divorce, illnesses and instability…all the things. She destroyed my furniture, retaliated against being yelled at by randomly pooping outside of her boxes (surprise!) and if she ever landed herself in trouble (like a struggle with a kitchen strainer vs. soft-paws, or getting herself trapped in a bag, or running out of kibble at the wrong times) she always sought me out to fix the situation. She was aloof and independent most of the day, but at night she’d invariably sneak up to my side and lick me until I’d smoosh her and turn the motor ON. She insisted her butt needed to point at my head and when I’d shove her off, she’d settle for my feet, or knees, or armpit…and still point her butt at me. She was a jerk.

This morning, the little snip made her way to my bed. She jumped and didn’t quite make it, so my son boosted her up. We’ve known for about a week this was coming. I figured she’d “tell” me when it was time to take her to the vet; instead, she just decided to spend her last hours in my bed with me, and I petted her and loved her, and somehow I hugged her as she was leaving. I just *knew.* I tried to argue with myself, but simultaneously pictured the Rainbow Bridge, and prayed that she would easily meet the furbabies I’ve been fortunate to share my life with in the past. Gosh, they leave a mark on the heart, don’t they? 

I’ll miss my sweet little baby jerk. So, so much. I loved her with my whole heart.",2023-11-30 03:30:51
My roommate put my cat out after my roommate's dog and my cat got into a fight. I am livid.,"My roommate and I both have pets, I have a cat (Willow) and my roommate has a dog (Harvey). They're not the best of friends but have never had any real problems. They were introduced correctly and now mostly just stay out of each other's way. I was going home for a week for Thanksgiving break and my roommate was staying in the apartment so I asked her to take care of Willow for me and it's something she's done for me before with no issues so she agreed. I left Monday last week and when I came home, my roommate informed me that when I was gone Willow and Harvey got into a fight and it got so bad that she ""had"" to put Willow out. I almost felt like I was going to pass out from anger. I asked her for details and she said Willow kept swiping and hissing at Harvey who then started chasing her around the apartment and at one point actually caught up to her and bit her. My roommate's solution was to put my cat out until she ""calmed down"" and bring her back in after. But when she went back out to look for Willow, she was gone. That was on Friday, and I still have no idea where my cat is. She's injured and alone and scared and I'm completely devastated. I've been putting up fliers around the area but no one has reached out yet. I don't think I've ever been this angry in my life. What do I even do in a situation like this? ",2023-11-29 22:55:44

My cat is dying and my dad won't do anything,"This is mostly a rant so I'm not really expecting any advice.

Approximately two years ago, lady next door gave my dad a male cat since her cat gave birth to many kittens and she couldn't take care of them all. My dad was happy about that and he actually liked the cat. When I suggested we take him to get vaccinees, he shrugged me off and said it'll be ok.
 
A few months later, he started losing interest so I became responsible of feeding the cat, playing with it, etc.. and I actually grew fond of that and also loved the cat. 
So, every once in a while, the cat would get serious coughing and sneezing attacks that were kinda alarming but my dad again said it's normal.

Now, a few days ago, my cat's been getting worse. He no longer wants to eat (he used to be always excited about eating), it takes much strength for him to move, he's always sleeping, he's also shivering, etc...
Today, I told my dad that we should take him to the vet quickly otherwise we may lose him and his response was literally this: ""God blessed cats with strong immunity to sicknesses so he won't die. Vets are just for feminine (idk how to translate it to english) people.""

I even suggested we take him with my own pocket money and he said no. If I could I would do it in a heartbeat but the nearest vet is 15-20 kilometers away and I'm a minor anyways so I'd probably not be able to handle it myself.

Oh, btw, through this all, I forgot to mention that my parents never let the cat in the house because they say ""he leaves too much hair"" and we always keep him in the garden.

I'm really lost and I don't want to lose my cat.

Edit: Thank you all for the advice. Also, to everyone saying I should let myself be grounded, that entails 2 weeks of emotional abuse, no pocket money (need it for my school bus) and giving my phone to my parents (i use it for homework and stuff) but I guess that doesn't compare to a poor cat losing his life so I'll see what I can do 
Also my dad literally made fun of the idea of taking a pet to the vet because it apparently ""makes him less than a man""",2023-11-29 01:27:30

After almost three days and already giving up hope, I came home and heard her meowing outside waiting to be let in. She slept a lot but seems fine.  She's currently laying on the floor scratching herself like nothing happened.

I still have no idea how she could've gotten outside.

Thanks again everyone for your help and concern.

Am I being unreasonable about how long my cats waited for their dental appointments today?,"-- Totally skippable background context --

My two cats have been seeing the same vet for about 3 years, since we moved here. When we first arrived, COVID was still a big concern (the vaccines weren't even out yet) and they only did curbside drop-off. Totally reasonable. I dropped my cats off at 7:30 in the morning, and they told me they'd be ready to be picked up ""after 2"". I hadn't heard anything by 3, so I called them, and they hadn't gotten to my cats yet. My cats weren't ready to be picked up until after their office had closed at 6 PM.

For their next two annual exams, they still weren't allowing customers in the exam rooms but I was able to get set appointment times, so I arrived with the cats and sat in the waiting area for about an hour and a half while their exams were done in the back.

This really wasn't my favorite policy, but the vet herself is very good and was really thorough about checking out my cats. However, it really seemed to stress out my orange cat. He's friendly, but doesn't like to be restrained and is very wiggly. He won't scratch or bite, but it can be tricky to get him to cooperate because he's so big and strong. With our old vet, I was in the exam room and was able to hold him so they could give him shots or draw blood. The first time the new vet saw him, they had a lot of trouble drawing blood and just had to give up. The second time, they had to sedate him to even give him his vaccinations. 

-- Background over --

After their last annual exam, the vet thought the orange kitty needed a tooth removed and the brown kitty should have her teeth cleaned. Orange boy has always had horrible teeth, so that wasn't surprising, and the brown girl has never had her teeth cleaned at all and is 13, so it was probably time! 

I dropped the cats off at 7:30 AM and was told they'd be ready after 2. I hadn't heard anything by 3, so I called them. They hadn't gotten to my cats yet. (If you read the first paragraph, this might sound familiar). I said I'd just take them home and we'd try again another time, but apparently the orange boy was already being sedated. I called again at 5 at they had just finished with him, and then called again at 6:30 and they had just finished with my other cat. They didn't contact me at any point throughout the day - I had to call each time. They wanted to keep the cats overnight for observation, but no one would be there from 8 PM - 7 AM and I really didn't want them stuck those little 3x3 kennels all night alone.  

When I arrived, I asked the receptionist about the delay and she said ""well I said after 2..."" When I asked the vet tech, she just said there were other surgeries. It seemed like both of them felt like this was totally normal and I had no reason to even ask about it.

Between this and not being able to go in for appointments, I'm thinking it's time to switch vets. When my orange cat had dental appointments in the past, I was able to pick him up within five hours, not nearly 12 hours later. It seems like they must either be understaffed or they just have other cats that are higher priority (or both). Or am I just being a total Karen here?",2023-11-28 09:59:37
Vet in Miami killed my dog from neutering procedure,"I’ve never posted on here but here it goes…in June of this year we took our healthy 3 yo labradoodle to a vet in Miami Beach to get neutered. We couldn’t go to our vet because he had a testicle retained in his abdomen which required a more extensive procedure/surgery which I was told was also pretty routine and not complicated. I found a vet on Miami Beach that would do this and after the initial consultation, we scheduled his surgery for the following week. After surgery we picked him up, where the vet told us the surgery went well, he did great, and he would probably be in more pain than normal because the testicle was “really stuck in there” and she claimed she had to pull hard to get it out. That night he was very very sick. Lethargic, sweaty ears, couldn’t lay down, throwing up and hadn’t peed since surgery. The vet finally agreed to do an X-ray where she came back to us told us she couldn’t see the bladder. She had no words and was dumbfounded. We asked a million questions and she just stood there and said she would have to do emergency surgery to try and fix it but she guesses it ruptured somehow. He went in for another surgery and 4 hours later she called my husband and said there was nothing she can do and she recommended not waking him up. That’s when we started realizing something was very wrong with this vet and rushed to pick up our dog and take him to a hospital with a board certified surgeon that could try and save him. We did and after several excruciating hours, they saved him. He was in their intensive care for ten days in recovery. The surgeon there was in shock at what the original vet had done. She said she believes this vet accidentally removed his prostate gland instead of his testicle as well as severely damaged his urethra and bladder. She was able to save him but told us his recovery would be long and he may be incontenent for the rest of his life. After ten days we brought him home with a catheter, a diaper and several prescription medications. He was unable to pee on his own. For the next two months he was in and out of the hospital for treatment and care. At home we had to clear his catheter and change his diaper every few hours. During those two months he developed a nasty bacteria in his bladder. We tried in two instances to give him medications to get rid of it but none were successful. He didn’t seem like he was in pain and we were told that we would find the medication that would help him get rid of it and that he was going to get better. During all of this I was 9 months pregnant. Two weeks after giving birth, we noticed our dogs diaper didn’t have pee after a few hours, when it usually had a lot. We called the vet and they told us to bring him in. The next 24 hours were a blur. When they were cleaning his bladder, he went into shock (basically a coma) and very quickly went on life support. The next day my husband and I had to make the devastating decision to put him to sleep. This has been the most traumatizing and devastating thing to happen to us. I want justice and I want this vet that did this to him and us to pay. We’ve been told and have read that it’s unlikely she’ll lose her license, but how can she not? She mistakenly removed an organ that had nothing to do with the surgery, and then intentionally performed a second surgery she knew she was unqualified to do, damaging him even more. She killed him. We have all the evidence, including the medical opinion of the board certified surgeon all of which has been submitted to the Florida board of veterinary medicine but I’m scared they won’t do anything and this woman will live her life and run her vet practice carefree. This has been so painful to write out and relive but if I can get anything out of it, that’s all I want. Please let me know if  anyone help guide me on what else I should and can do to get us justice and to get this vet to lose her license indefinitely.

FIRST UPDATE: after reporting the vet, I received the following letter from the FL department of business & professional regulation. Can a vet/lawyer/or someone who’s done this before tell me if this letter is standard process, or if it looks like it has been escalated beyond normal process and she will most likely have some sort of consequence? 

Dear X: 
Your complaint against VET has been forwarded to our Miami Regional Office for further investigation. The investigator assigned to your complaint will contact you if any additional information is needed. 
Pursuant to Florida law, VET will be provided with a copy of your complaint and given an opportunity to submit a written response to your complaint. Once the investigation is complete, the file will be forwarded to the Office of the General Counsel and assigned to a prosecutor for review. 
The Department investigation and the evidence obtained during the investigation is confidential and remains confidential unless there is a finding of probable case. A finding of probable cause is appropriate when there is enough evidence to believe that the subject of the complaint has committed a violation of applicable laws or rules. If the Department's Office of the General Counsel or the professional board reviewing this matter finds probable cause that the alleged violation(s) occurred, the file becomes public ten days later. If there is no finding of probable cause, the entire file remains confidential. Whether probable cause is found or not. you will be notified of the outcome. 
We hope this information is helpful. If you have any questions, please contact the Regional Office. Thank you for bringing this matter to the Department's attention. 
Sincerely,

"In your opinion, would you let your dog around this dog?","Without going down a whole rabbit hole, my sister is very much into natural practices and does not use any chemicals in her household of any sort. She has a dog who she DOES NOT treat for fleas, ticks, or heartworms and relies on her natural methods to keep her dog healthy (they feed him Farmer's Dog to give you an idea). After learning she doesn't treat her dog, my roommate and I believe the fleas our cat got could have possibly been from the dog. This is because we came home from a trip and found her itching more regularly and the people who watched her were at her house prior to and then walked all around our place with their shoes still on...(our pet camera confirmed).

Anyways, I am planning to bring home a lab puppy in the Spring and I am already thinking about if I want that dog to be around her place. I will obviously be treating the dog for fleas, ticks, heartworms and now the cat will as well. I will be asking the vet as well for their professional opinion once the puppy is here but curious if you would let your dog around the other dog? Or even just the house?",2023-11-27 22:19:55
pets in bed 🛌,"hello everybody. i just moved to a new house and my partner refused to let my cats to sleep in our bedroom. he comes out with all sorts of reason like sleep disruption and he’s “allergic” (debatable, his parents house is filled with cats and not once did i see him sneeze). my cats are so scared from moving (they need to establish a new routine) and i feel bad if they are alone at night (which they are not used to).

i’ve set up a safe space for them in the study room where there is their litter boxes, food, water and toys.. i also have been sleeping in the study so that they know i’m there at night for these few days. 

i eventually would want to move back to the bedroom because my back fucking hurts from sleeping on the sofa lol. my partner just doesn’t understand where i’m coming from like i work a 9-5 and the only time i get to bond with my cat is snuggling with them in bed at night and on the weekends. so sad that i’m not able to do that anymore 😞 what do i do?",2023-11-27 20:21:36
I rescued a cat and a few hours later she had a seizure :(,"Hi - long post ahead so I apologize in advance. I’ve never posted on Reddit before, but I’m really concerned about a cat I just rescued. Today my partner's co-worker brought up that he had found a cat on the street outside his apartment and was looking for someone to foster or adopt her. My partner and I have rescued cats in the past, but don’t currently have a pet and have been wanting to adopt, so we went over to go meet her. She was adorable, so sweet and really cooperative. When we had to put her in the carrier, she was clearly very stressed (hissing, clawing) but nothing out of the ordinary. When we got her in the car to drive to the vet, she was calm the whole way over. We took her to an emergency vet in our neighborhood for some basic checks - we asked if she had a micro-chip and she didn’t. She also was not neutered so I assume she’s a street cat. They said she appeared to be about 1 year old. We also asked if they could check for fleas and when they took us into a room to do so, she became pretty hostile. She was clawing and scratching and growling to the point where I was starting to get worried about bringing her home. My partner convinced me to do it anyway and the second she came inside she was a perfect angel. She ate all the food we gave her, drank a lot of water, and was immediately affectionate with us both. She hardly hid and spent most of the night sitting with us on the couch and sprawling across our laps. I did notice that she seemed a little congested, and thought it might be a cold or fever from being out in the cold, rainy, weather. I think at that point we started to get our hopes up about adopting her rather than just fostering. When we started heading to bed, she followed us to our room and fell asleep on a cushion by our bed. Then, very suddenly, she started having a seizure. It lasted about two minutes and was scary and upsetting to witness. Obviously I’m concerned that it could be a chronic illness, but I’m wondering if it could possibly have been triggered by dehydration or stress from the ups and downs of the rescue process. Has anyone had a similar experience after rescuing a cat? I want to keep her, so I’m really hoping it’s the latter, but if it is chronic I don’t think I’m financially stable enough to pay for extensive treatment. I lost a cat to cancer not too long ago and it’s heartbreaking to think about going through the process again. I’ll be taking her to the vet later this week to be certain, but am looking for some advice if anyone has had a similar experience! 

Thanks x",2023-11-27 15:12:01
Finally figured out where the stains on my bed are coming from…my dog’s butt,"I was holding my dog on my lap and an awful smell appeared out of nowhere. I removed her from my lap and found a small amount of brownish liquid on my pants. Smelled it, and knew for sure that’s what it was. I looked at her butt and saw she had a little bit left over on her bum too. 

According to my googling, it is anal gland secretion. So this is what i have been finding on my bed like once a week, but without the smell. She just got groomed yesterday so that was the last time her glands were expressed, so i can see why she might still be loose” today, but idk why she is secreting every week or if that’s normal. 

Is there anything I can do to control her secretions? Aside from that, she is a healthy, 4yr old, spayed pom/eskimo/terrier mix.",2023-11-27 09:36:25
Friend is in military wants me to loo after cat while in deployment,My friend found a stray cat while station overseas. It was a stray off the street it's not fixed. It's had none of its shots I'm pretty sure it's feral. He has had it for a month. I already have a dog a husky that's 70 pounds. I really don't mind cats but my dog isn't the best with small animals they tend to go after him for some reason. Maybe it's like a size differental and they want to feel big. I don't know why he thinks it's okay to put the burden on me. He's going to be stationed overseas for another 9 months so basically I would have to look after it for 9 months or maybe more if he gets redeployed. I don'tind cats but I don't like owing a litter box in my house making the house smell and have cat litter everywhere. I don't have much room in my apartment as it is I'm not even sure where I would keep the cat maybe the bathroom but I would have to close a whole room to the cat. I did that one for my sister's cat when she went on vacation for a week I definitely didn't go well. The cat was very aggressive towards my dog and it was also territoral even tho it wasn't even his home. It struck me as weird since every time I saw the cat at my sister's house it was very friendly. I just don't think it's fair for my friend to just push this cat on me for almost a year without its shots or beating fixed. What does everyone think. Am I just being an a hole?,2023-11-27 07:34:09

My neighbor makes her cat sleep outside. I don't think he wants to.,"My neighbor is a vet receptionist, she loves animals but she collects too many. She has two big dogs in her small house and one out back in a kennel, now her daughter brought a cat home. He's very sweet and friendly. My neighbor said he's ""mostly outdoors"" but he comes inside our house all the time and is very affectionate and clearly wants to sleep in the house with humans. She has a carrier full of hay on her porch for him to sleep in, but I don't like that he's mostly outdoors. I don't think he wants to be, and I worry about what might happen to him. I want to let him sleep in our house, but he's not my cat, I'm very allergic and he really wants to sleep in our bed.

"Can't find my indoor cat, don't think she got outside.","Last time I remember seeing her was giving her dinner around 5 last night. It's 8:30 in the morning and still no sign of her.  She usually sleeps with me in the bedroom but occasionally doesn't so I wasn't concerned. Woke up and put the food out but she didn't come (she always comes for food)  looked everywhere I can think of but no sign and no sounds. 
 
What could've happened? Could she be sick? Died? She was fine yesterday.

Update 1: it's almost 1pm now and no luck.  Been going around searching and then staying quiet and listening but no luck yet.  Also walked around the neighborhood calling for her in case she got out, but she's not the type to dash outside so unless she found another way out I'm pretty sure she's in the house.  Haven't checked absolutely everything so I'll check again in the evening when I get back from some appointments

Update 2: it's now almost 6 pm, more than a day since she last ate, and the food I put out this morning hasnt been touched.  I've turned the house upside-down looking in all the unlikely places you've all suggested (thank you all for the suggestions btw)  I think I've looked everywhere. If she is inside and trapped, I don't understand why she wouldn't be making noise.  I've accidentally locked her in the closet before and could hear her when she wanted to get out.  
Maybe she did get outside somehow.

Update 3: been 2 days now. Ran out of places to look so I occasionally go around calling and listening, but nothing. She's not the kind of cat to hide, or stay quiet, so I'm going to have to assume the worst.  She was a rescue cat I got a little over 2 years ago, after my last (outdoor) cat was run over by someone speeding through my quiet neighborhood. She came from some cat hoarder's place so she had a rough life and was rail thin when I got her when she was 3-4yo.  She quickly warmed up to her new life and even became slightly overweight.  She'd come when I'd call, remind me when it was her feeding time, and wait inside the door when I came home. I'll miss her.

Final Update: found her!  Thank you all for your advice and support!

After almost three days and already giving up hope, I came home and heard her meowing outside waiting to be let in. She slept a lot but seems fine.  She's currently laying on the floor scratching herself like nothing happened.

“My dog saw my other dog get hit by a car”,"My 2 year old dog male saw my 10 month old dog female get hit by a FedEx truck. He stayed and waited with her until I came out and found her bleeding out. I carried her inside where he tried to wake her up scratch, nudge her , but i wrapped her up in a towel because I could see she passed. It’s very sad and unfortunate because we bought her as a companion for him. The first few days he ran around  the house looking for her, taking her favorite toys to and from her bed wandering back and forth, sitting looking out the window or by the front door, barking at everything and anyone that passes by. But recently he’s stopping eating, farting and is vomiting foam. Could this be signs of anxiousness? Or grieving? Nothing has changed much of his diet or daily routine other than her absence. Im 6 months pregnant and haven’t stopped crying since the accident. It’s hard for me to take him for his usual walks to the park but I snuggle with him and show him plenty of affection since I’m grieving as well. I have huge guilt about the entire thing. I’m not eating or sleeping well and my doctor prescribed me anti depressants. Will any of this get easier?

"Neighbor threw out their kitten, need help figuring out what to do","I am in a tough spot and need some ideas/resources. 

My neighbor recently got evicted and moved out in a hurry. She abandoned her (5-6 month old?) cat. I found it outside in the back yard, cold and wet from the rain. Nobody has been back to the house to look for the cat. I have taken it inside and have been looking after it for the past few days. Currently he is in an extra large crate with food, water, blankets, and litter. There is no way I could let the poor baby freeze to death outside.

I cannot keep the cat long term. I already have senior animals in the household that are not friendly with new cats. I work in the medical industry and have serious hours that would not be sufficient for the time it takes to make a situation like this work. I feel bad enough that he has had to stay in a crate most of the time.

This is the first time I’ve dealt with a situation like this and my priority is just getting the kitty into better hands/a good home. My location is a small-ish town near the DMV area. I have called the local Humane Society and 3 local rescues and they are all at capacity.

Why do cats freeze up when you put something on their back?,Yesterday I had a long strand of plain cooked spaghetti and our cat was curious and he decided to investigate. Soon he started to enjoy playing with the strand and I dangled it in front of him like a cat toy and he was swatting it around and stuff and we were having fun playing around. Then I playfully dropped it and it landed on his back and suddenly he froze and started staggering around like he couldn't walk from that single strand of spaghetti on his back. I got worried and I picked the sphagetti off of him and he went back to normal playing with it. I remembered that he reacted the same way in the beginning when we used to put a harness on him to take him for walks. I also remember seeing a video of a cat having a flower placed on his head and he freezes up. I was just wondering what the purpose was behind this behavior and if it is in any way distressing for the cat?,2023-11-25 07:47:12
TW: Animal Neglect. How to report family for dog neglect?,"Located in California.

Hi. So, my family has two dogs, a ~2 year old chihuahua and a 6 month old small mixed breed. They are kept on the balcony all day, all night. Their food is dumped in piles in front of the door and I think someone changes their water frequently (IDK if it's everyday. I don't live here I'm just visiting). The older dog gets basically no interaction and is huddled in the corner depressed. The puppy belongs to my sister (18) and supposedly she takes him out to play with him like, once a week? Their balcony is covered in piss and shit and they both smell terrible, which is also why my mother won't allow them inside. As well as because they're not potty trained. The puppy started as an indoor dog with my sister promising to take care of him and train him, but that obviously didn't last.

They have a history of doing this. The last time I was here I threatened them with animal control and that got them to put the older one inside for a time. The puppy was indoors at the time (though frequently neglected by my sister while she went out all the time with her son). They've done it again. I've stopped fooling myself that they'll ever change. I'm ready to report or steal and re-home the dogs. This family, this community, it feels like this entire fucking city treats dogs like shit and my family calls me hysterical and crazy for saying this is wrong and has always been wrong. I don't care if it destroys my relationship with my sister or gets me ostracized by the rest of my family anymore. 

Will animal control do anything if they have food and water available to them? (They are frequently full in this area because people suck. So they have to close surrender intake often. Am unsure if intake is closed now) 
I am thinking of literally just picking them both up and dropping them at a shelter, but am unsure if puppy is microchipped (older one definitely isn't) and if that would get me in legal trouble if my sister calls the police. I am planning to take pictures of the balcony but is there any other information I should collect? Also thinking of reaching out to facebook groups to see if anyone can take them to emergency foster (this would probably be easier with the puppy).

Edited to add: I reached out to a rescue situation last time about the chihuahua and they said they could not take him because he had nipped my sister's toddler in the past. He is an extremely cuddly and clingy guy and literally only wants to sit in your lap but he does not like children. I don't either so I don't blame him. My sister's kid is poorly behaved most of the time. 

Edit 2: I think I can get my mom to relinquish her chihuahua willingly. I have little hope for getting my sister to relinquish the puppy though. She says he's special because he was given to her son by her bf's parents as a companion for the kid. She's very entitled, responds to my concerns about his welfare with ""It's my dog. It's my life. I can do what I want. Stop being nosy. You're really going to report your own family to animal control? Over a dog?"" And similar. 

Edit: conversation with my mom did not go well. Am now looking for an emergency foster/rehome situation for them both.",2023-11-24 21:57:06
Bleeding hearts want to take in a stray... help?,"I (31F) own a 4 year old pitt mix named Luna. She has been my ESA for years and is mostly well-trained, however she has been attacked by another dog before and as such, struggles with other animals. She adores my GF (30F) and said GF and I are looking to move in together. My (soon to be our) apartment complex has a stray cat - Orange Cat. My GF visits often, and the cat has become a good omen for us. We greet the cat when he shows up at my car or my door. Please note: we don't feed him. Someone else in the complex does, though I don't know who.

Both of us wish Orange Cat had a home. He's sweet and friendly. Tonight, he followed us from our car to my apartment. Luna was overly excited to see him - the way dogs get excited to see rabbits and other prey animals. Fortunately, we kept them separate. However, we've seen them interact through the fence of my backyard, and Luna goes into ""puppy pose"" and tries to entice him to play the way she might with a friendly dog. We live in Texas, so it's not that cold yet, but with winter approaching, we started talking about what it would be like to take Orange Cat in. Neither of us have ever had a cat, though! We also have some significant financial squeeze on us (hence the moving in together), so I worry about how to provide for two pets.

What advice would you give us about adopting Orange Cat? If we can't adopt him, how else can we help this lovely baby get through the winter?

Edit for clarification: My GF and I started contacting shelters a few weeks ago with no luck. Last time we tried was a few days ago. Some were closed because of Thanksgiving, and the others were full. Thank you all for the variety of suggestions!

Update: We intend to build an outdoor shelter for Orange Cat as we look into cat rescues. We recognize we aren't necessarily the best home for him, but we want to do all we can that he finds a home. As the title says, we're bleeding hearts, especially where animals are concerned. Thank you all for the advice! At this time we are only taking well wishes for Orange Cat and any San Antonio area Cat Rescue recommendations. (Or, ya know, if you're in a better place to take the kitty... DM me). Have a great night!

Update 2: Cat shelter is up and Orange Cat seems to be taking to it nicely!",2023-11-24 11:38:23
"People with cats, I have questions","Me and my mom want a cat. She has had dogs, I’ve never had a pet. I have some questions- where is the best place to get a kitten (it’s what we want) I’ve looked and some shelters might have kittens but I’m not 100% sure
Is there any info that people who have never had a cat should know about cats?
Any info would be appreciated😊 
Happy thanksgiving to everybody",2023-11-24 11:21:20
My cat stopped bothering with me,"My cat always followed me around the house and always slept in my room, she literally did everything with me until around a week ago.. she now sleeps downstairs in the lounge on the sofa. She just stays downstairs all day now and doesn’t come to my room anymore.. she used to sit on my lap at least once a day. I just want to know why it seems like she doesn’t like me anymore. ( She always did everything with me for years but not recently.. ) 😔 I hope this is just a winter phase.. has anyone else experienced this before :(",2023-11-24 09:04:31
My cat just gave birth to 5 kittens. HOW???? I got her spayed when she was a kitten,"I'm completely confused.  My cat is about 2 years old and I got her spayed when she was a kitten. Her names Lucy by the way. Lucy has been getting very large recently and we thought she had a feeding round. Have kept her in for a while so she only eats her food but she was still getting bigger and today literally 30 minutes ago she gave birth in my sock draw to 5 kittens . I mean HOW is this even possible when I got her spayed . 
Is spaying not 100% ???",2023-11-24 08:48:28
Terrified or getting tapeworms from cat,"Ok, so, I adopted a cat about seven weeks ago. I named him Geralt, and he is my whole world. I knew after week one at home with me that he had ear mites. I took him to the vet, they treated him, and two weeks later he got an ear infection as a side effect of the ear mite treatment. Literally a week after that, I come home from work on my lunch break, to an apartment COVERED in puke piles. I even stepped in one cause I didn’t notice it when I walked in. My poor little man is quiet, and upset, still puking as I walk around my apartment to see where I’ll have to clean. As I examined the puke, I realized there was TAPEWORMS IN IT. FIVE INCH LONG TAPEWORMS. I lost my shit. I called into work, rushed him to the vet, where they sent me home with a topical dewormer. Fast forward a little over a week later, and Geralt is doing fine. He is still losing little tuffs of hair (something I noticed a day or two leading up to the worm/ puke incident) but other than that, he is fine. I, on the other hand, AND LOSING MY MIND. I am terrified of getting these worms from him. I’ve been heavily exposed. He sleeps in my bed, his dishes are washed with mine, with the same sponge. He walks on my pillows. I called my doctor and they won’t give me a damn thing until I start showing symptoms myself. I am losing my mind. And ever since yesterday I’ve been sick. Stomach aches, rushing to the bathroom, abdominal pain, and today I have a fever and can’t eat. I haven’t noticed any worms, but I am terrified none the less. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",2023-11-24 04:19:18
Can't move my dog to a new vet.,"Previous owner moved to Australia 16 months ago. Original plan was I'd foster care until he could arrange transfer.

After a while of keeping her we both decided it wasnt fair on the dog to put her through the stress of travel and she'd be better staying with me. All agreed, all fine.

Trouble is he is awful at communications. I've transferred the microchip on the basis that he had 30 days to respond and after that it just automatically transfers.

Her current vet is Vets4Pets, miles from me. I keep ringing asking them to change the ownership to me, and they can't until he replies to an email they sent. That was 2 months ago and he hasn't replied.

I'm stuck because I don't know what else I can do - I ask him to reply to the email and he never does.",2023-11-23 21:54:37
I’m allergic to cats and my girlfriend has one. Wtd?,"Me and my girlfriend dated for about a a year until I went on exchange in Europe this past year. I came back and we slowly started dating again. While I was away, she got herself a cat. He is very cute but I developed a really bad allergy to cats over the past few years and for some reason hers affects me the most. I could tolerate it at the beginning taking allergy medication but now it’s gotten so bad that I can barely breathe when I go over. It makes me sad because it doesn’t seem like she understands and just thinks I can get over it or take allergy meds but the meds make me feel wonky and drowsy. She gets mad at me when I don’t want to go to her place but it’s because I literally cannot breathe. She says that there are steps that we can take for me to not be allergic but I think it’s easier said than done. I also feel like the symptoms have been getting worse and worse (if that’s even possible?). Yesterday, for example, I went to sleep at her house for the first time in 3 weeks and had to leave after a few hours because I was coughing so much and my throat was closing. 

I’m not sure what to do because she gets angry at me and emotional when we talk about it saying things like “what are we gonna do when we’re older and want to live together?” And “what are we gonna do when I have school and I can’t drive all the way to your house all the time?” 

It’s doesn’t seem like she understands how difficult it is to live with allergies this bad.  

Not sure what to do and was wondering if anyone who has gone through something similar can help me. 

Thanks

Edit: I’d like to clarify that I would never put someone in a position where they would have to get rid of their cat. It was never even a consideration. ",2023-11-23 06:19:00
My arthritic dog attacked my other dog. Now we have to put her down.,"This happened just the day before.

I have two dogs. One is an old German shepherd around 12 years old who has arthritis and the other is a three - or four year old terrier mix. 

This was completely unexpected because they were best friends and always played together since the moment they met. 

Before, we had four dogs. One was a little poodle mix, and the other was also a terrier mix. Unfortunately, our poodle had to be put down as she was getting very old, and she had frequent seizures and was unable to walk.

She was considered the 'head of the pack' since she was there the longest. It felt like all balance had been undone since then.

Unfortunately, I regret to admit that this was not the first attack. Our older terrier mix was, well, becoming kinda senile and anxious as she got older. She'd bark for 30 minutes at things and just never stop. 

Our German shepherd was seemingly at her wits end one night and attacked her. The poor thing almost died, and we had to rush her to the vet. 

Nobody really knew what the reason was for it. If it was because she was annoyed by her, if there were some issues with dominance or something else.

We decided to keep our German shepherd but to give our little dog to our grandparents, where she has lived to this day.

We thought all our problems were solved since our German shepherd never acted up that way. 

In recent months, our German shepherds' health has been declining. She can no longer go on short walks as she gets exhausted and sore. She was diagnosed with very severe arthritis and has trouble going up and down the stairs. She no longer joins us in bed and sleeps downstairs now.

I feel so guilty when we take our young terrier out, but she can't understand why she can't go. She really loves being outside. She'll sit on our back deck and sniff the air, and look around for as long as she can. Sometimes, she stays out there for an hour.

Anyway, we thought everything was fine and well until we came home today. Our dogs greeted us excitedly and trotted off to the living room, where our German shepherd just randomly attacked our little dog out of nowhere. She probably would have killed her if we didn't step in.

The little dog is fine. She has a bite mark in her head, but it didn't break the skin. 

And now we don't know what to do now. The two were separated but sadly looking at each other through our glass kitchen door because they wanted to play together. Obviously, we won't let them because our shepherd could attack again.

Today, they were all buddy-buddy again and happily sniffing at each other, eager to play together.

My older brother took her out on a car ride, and the family is discussing what we should do.

We don't even know why this happened exactly. If it's because she's in pain or something else.

We medicate our dog with medication from the vet, but her arthritis doesn't seem to ease up. She's a quiet dog, but it's clear she is dealing with constant discomfort. 

I feel so awful and guilty because we don't want to give her away since nobody would want her. 

And I don't want to put her down because I know she's not a bad dog, and I don't want her to be scared and confused. I don't want her to hate us. 

And I'm also not sure if it's ethical to do so, I mean, I don't know how bad her arthritis is, so I worry we will be sending her to sleep prematurely when she seems fine to me.

But we can't risk her killing our little dog or hurting a person if it came to it. 

I don't know if this is the right decision. I've been feeling physically sick because of this situation.

//Minor update//

 Mom's response to commemts: ""Yeah, I don't know anything about that medication, but where she's already attacked two different dogs now, it might be beyond medication at this point. We can not deal with a big dog being randomly aggressive for no reason. It's not safe for anyone.""

""I imagine it is probably very expensive. Because the last medication I got for her was $90""

//Update two//

I am beyond angry right now. So I spoke with my sister in law a few moments ago, and it turns out my mom has NOT been taking the advice of multiple vets and the advice of my sister in law. She has NOT been giving my dog her medication at ALL. 

She is going to kill my dog because she chose not to follow the advice of professionals. What do I even do??? Our dog is beyond help that I, myself, can provide. This is so cruel and evil. I'm comforting my dog and giving her all the love I can give right now. 

This week has been a nightmare from this situation and other personal issues I prefer not to mention as they are off-topic.

I don't have a job, and even if I wanted to pay for any expenses on medication, I know my mom wouldn't let me. I'm so upset. I don't think I'll ever forgive my mom for this. I've had this dog since I was like 5 or 6, and now she's being taken away because my mom neglected the advice of professionals.

How do I even go on now? How do I grieve when I know it's gotten this bad because of my mom?

//Update three//

My mom insisted that she had, in fact, used the medication on the dog. I don't think she's telling the entire truth, though. 

I personally think she only used the medication for a day or two before calling it quits because she didn't see results immediately. I don't think she realizes that you're supposed to use medication long-term.

Unfortunately, she's made up her mind. Like I said in some of my comments, we don't have the money to provide her the quality care she needs. 

 I'm not sure when our Shepherd will have her appointment, but I made sure to make her a special dinner tonight, as it's probably going to be her last. 

I'll make an update after the matter.

To my dog,

I'm so sorry, my sweet girl. I'm sorry that we didn't give you the life you deserved.

I'm sorry for the times I'd get angry when you'd smother me when I know all you wanted to do was love me. You just didn't realize that you were big. You were a little, gentle lapdog in your heart. 

I'm so sorry for all the pain we've put you through. It's not fair. I hope that when the time comes, you are not scared and confused. I hope you dont hate us. I'm so sorry. I love you so much.

//Update four//

I FINALLY CONVINCED MY MOM TO GET OUR DOG NEW MEDICATION 

I will be giving the 200 I get a month to our dog to get Librela for her as one of the comments suggested.

My brother will also be pitching in money for medication. 

As for our little dog... Seperating the dogs will be fine since our Shepherd doesn't like moving much, so she'd be fine with hanging out in a room separate from our little dog.

Our little one might be a little lonely, but our shepherd doesn't like playing as much as she used to. So I don't think she'll care very much.

I'm so glad. I'll probably delete this post after a few days, but I wanted you all to know that she'll be okay.

She's around 12 years old, and shepherds usually only live to be 13 at the very most, so this will not be a long arrangement. But she deserves to have her pain eased while she's still here with us. 

While she's still here, we'll make sure to take her on all sorts of adventures and walks (with breaks, of course :) ) 

I'm so glad that things turned out okay. I feel so relieved. 

Maybe I'll make a small update in the comments about our shepherds condition after getting her new medication. 

But for now, our shepherd's life is safe. Thank you to everyone who gave me support and commented advice.",2023-11-23 00:34:24
"My puppy got hit by a car and broke her leg, vet wants to amputate. She's not even 1 yet and I don't know what to do!","My Kelpie pup got hit my a car (it was going slow and for the most part she is okay), she broke the growth plate in her back leg and was abit scratched up, my poor girly. My local vet said I should consider amputating the leg, otherwise the surgery to reinforce the growth plate may not take and may also put stress on he other leg. Both options are very expensive and if i shoose to save her leg but it doesn't work, then I'll be stuck paying even more for another surgery. As grateful as i am to still have her,  I'm so lost, she is my baby I just want whats best for her. What would you do?",2023-11-22 23:01:44
Moving out and parents told me they will be keeping the dog,"We adopted my dog in 2018. At the time I was recently diagnosed with a chronic disease and was struggling mentally. I had wanted a dog for years but my dad wasn’t ready after our last dog had passed (in 2010), however my mom finally convinced him after my constant nagging and me being in the hospital. 

My mom and I went to pick her up in January 2018 at 8 weeks old (dad was on vacation but the pick up date was known). Since then she’s slept with me every night. I’ve taken care of her, trained her, walked her and played with her daily. She’s a stubborn terrier and really only listens to me (eventually will listen to my parents but they have to yell and chase her). When I sleep over my girlfriend’s house or if I go away for a weekend, she will wake my parents up several times a night to go out (sleeps through the night with me). She’s a pain to them. I also work from home while they work 7am-6pm shifts, so she’s always been used to me being home. 

My girlfriend and I are going to be moving in together in a week, and it’s over an hour away from my parents. We’ll have a house with a fenced in yard, and she absolutely LOVES my girlfriend (sometimes even chooses her over me for lap snuggles). Ive somewhat avoided the “who gets the dog” conversation as I knew it’d be hard. My mom had made it known she wants the dog to go with me, but my dad is another story. He loves her and they have their little routines. We let her run out to him when he comes home from work, she sits with him at dinner because he always gives her more food, and he likes her to “start out” sleeping with them (they’ve asked me to go grab her after they fall asleep, otherwise she’ll wake him up in the middle of the night several times). 

My mother asked me if he’s talked to me yet and I told her no. She broke the news last night that he wants to keep her because this is her home. When it comes down to it, they paid for her and all of her vet bills. They buy the food and everything. But she’s always been “my dog”.

As much as I tried to prepare myself for this possibility, it’s completely breaking me. I was stoked to be starting a new chapter with my girlfriend, and this took all of the excitement out of moving out for me. I truly feel like she’d be better with us, but I do feel awful about taking her away from my parents as well. Internet strangers, do you have any advice? 

TL;DR: Moving out with my girlfriend in a week, parents broke the news that they’re keeping the dog and I’m crushed.

Edit: This is getting a lot more attention than I expected. Thank you everyone for your suggestions and advice. Just to add some clarification, I don’t want to fight my parents on this and I understand the dog is technically their property. I’m not arguing that. I had wanted a dog for years and offered to pay for her and any expenses. My parents wanted to get her for me after constant nagging and a medical scare. I paid for a few bills early on as I do take her to her vet appointments, but we’re stubborn Italians and he was adamant about paying me back. Regardless, the money is not an issue - if she were to come with me I can financially support her and her need for many bones. I’m her primary care - I’m with her 24/7 as I work from home, I feed her, bathe her, walk and play with her daily, and she sleeps with me. She gravitates to me more than anyone else. I truly feel that my dog living with me and my girlfriend is better as her routine will not change at all. If she stays with my parents, she is acclimated with the home but will have to adjust to my parent’s schedule, not having someone home all day, and I can count on 1 hand how many times my parents have walked and bathed her. It’s a difficult situation no matter how you slice it, and I’m devastated that this was my dad’s choice. He hasn’t said a word to me about it.. my mother had to tell me. It’s almost as if he’s been ignoring me moving out all together. It’s how he is when he’s upset or stressed - he goes silent. 

I do plan on talking with him next time I have a chance. My girlfriend will be up for the weekend and I don’t want him to get upset over Thanksgiving. I really hope we can work something out because I’m truly devastated. She’s got me through a lot, and means so much more to me than just being my dog. 

Edit 2: My grandfather broke the ice. He was excited to hear the news that I am moving in with my girlfriend, and asked what would happen with the dog. My dad without hesitation said “she’s staying with us”. My grandparents both had my back without me saying a word - knowing the reason we got her and knowing how much she means to me. My dad compromised and said “well what we could do is have you take her on weeks and we get her on weekends.” I expressed my concern to him that it’s a lot of driving for us (it’s an hour and 20 minute drive to their house), and the dog would probably adapt best if her routine doesn’t change. Last night he was trying to work out how my mom can change to another position in her company so she doesn’t work as much and can get home for the dog. I asked what happened with getting her on weekdays and he kinda just brushed it off. He was also trying to figure out what time do with her for a day as neither of them will be home (weekend day that my girlfriend and I would be around but apparently that didn’t pop into his head as an option). My mom jumped in and said she agrees that us having her is the best option (which he also brushed off). She expressed concern that they won’t get sleep, and he replied “well I’ll retire soon, work for Uber and take her with me”. While I was on the floor with her playing, he kept calling her and trying to get her to come lay down with him for whatever reason (to which she literally ignored him because she was having fun). She then jumped up on my lap to sleep and it visibly irritated him. At this point he’s being an absolute dick. He’s completely taken all the excitement out of me moving out, hasn’t helped one bit with any part of the move, and from my POV he’s acting like a child that NEEDS to have his way. I was really hoping he’d come around and think logically but I don’t think he has the capacity to do so. I know this move is probably a lot on him, but the way he’s been handling it is really rubbing me the wrong way. At a point where I don’t even want to deal with him. ",2023-11-22 22:48:40
Cat acts like she’s starved,"I have an 8 year old house cat who used to be super mean. I’m talking attacking me at night. Biting for petting, and biting and not letting go. This was not usual behavior for her at all, so I took her to the vet. The vet said her belly was so swollen that she could hardly feel around it and said I was over feeding her. So I gradually cut back her food intake. She became normal again and stopped attacking me. We think her belly was hurting which is why she was being so mean. She’s lost weight, but is in a healthy range according to the vet, I think she’s like 7lbs or something like that. She used to be 11. 

However, she acts like she is never fed. She hops onto the counter every chance she gets and eats whatever she can get her paws on. You have to all but physically remove her from the counter. ALL THE TIME. She overs over my food when I eat ALL THE TIME. She just threw up (as cats do), and I had to pull her away from eating it to clean it up. Like drag her away. This is super new behavior for her. She gets fed every 6 hours, I think a quarter cup, which is still more than what the vet suggested. 

Should I add a little bit more to her food? I don’t want to hurt her belly again, but it’s like she starving and I don’t want to do that either (obviously). I was thinking increase one meal to half a cup and see if it helps the behavior, try two if it doesn’t etc. 

I know cats can be dramatic but this seems like it’s a real issue for her. Or maybe I’m just my spoiling her.


UPDATE: thank you for all of your advice. She had blood work done at the vet, and they didn’t mention anything about her thyroid. I will call next week to double check. Also to fix some information, she is getting 1/10 of a cup 6 time a day, so it comes out to just a bit over a half a cup a day. I didn’t want to go from over feeding to cutting back so drastically. She is a smaller cat, so 7lbs is a lighter weight. However you can’t see or feel ribs easily when you pet her and you can’t see her hips stick out. 

I will try adding some water to her food or maybe a small bit of wet food to see if that keeps her fuller. ",2023-11-22 17:42:17
Neighbours garden absolutely stinks from dog piss and shit,"The neighbour has 5 dogs and she doesn't seem to clean up after the dogs . Her garden absolutely stinks and I can now smell it from inside my own home and I have to shut the windows. I can't go into my own garden now because the smell is that bad. I looked out the window and there is dog shit all over her garden, tons of it. I made a small kind complaint to her today and she said its not her problem. She said it's the dogs garden and can go to the toilet where they like. She seems to think wild animals eat it and the rain washes it away but the rain makes it smell even worse. I don't know why she got so pissy with me I was very polite. All I said was, hey sorry to bother you, I'm not sure if you know but your garden is full of dog poo and the smell is that bad that I can smell it in my own home. 

I don't know where to go from here. I might complain to the council tomorrow to see of they can do anything",2023-11-22 08:07:50
My partners roommate abusing his own dog - advice encouraged,"Hi. I don’t even know where to start. My SO, Jack (23m), recently started crashing at his friend's place. Let's call this friend Tim (23m). Tim was kind enough to let Jack crash at his place while he was between jobs. The longer he stayed there, the more it came to my attention that Tim is a terrible dog owner. He would leave his dog, Valiente (5m), in the cage for hours on end. Whenever Tim left and Valiente was in the cage, the dog cried for hours on end, and nothing would stop him other than showing him some love. This dog cries so loud you can hear him from outside the building.

Tim tells Jack and the other roommate Chad (22m) to scream at Valiente and hit the cage with a shoe, but that obviously doesn’t work. Tim does no training for the dog at all. When confronted about the way Tim treats Valiente, he says, “Don’t tell me how to raise my dog.” Also worth noting, Tim is a hothead with no consideration for others. Tim was confronted individually by both Jack and Chad, and Tim felt he was being personally attacked, replying to them to stop interfering with how he cares for his dog.

Tim does not know how to regulate his emotions and is very quick to anger; he is known for destruction of property when upset. Tim only shows violence and intimidation to Valiente. For slight intimidation, he will grab his ear, pinch and twist. He will allow Valiente to choke himself on the leash and prong collar, and stand just far enough away to be pulling toward his owner, Tim, to say hi, and Tim just stands and stares as if it’s entertaining to him.

Tim beats him whenever he makes a mistake, so at least every month - in the time where my boyfriend has been crashing there, Valiente has been beaten at least 5 times from mid-September to mid-November. According to Chad, the beatings have gotten worse. When Tim beats Valiente, Tim pins him down, winds up, and lays straight punches to the belly/abdomen. Recently, Chad said that Tim was kicking Valiente because he sniffed near Berry's bowls - Berry wasn’t in the room.

There was one time Jack stepped out to chat with a friend, and his dog, Berry, was out in the living room. Tim was beating Valiente, and when my boyfriend came back to the apartment, Berry was in so much distress from hearing the other dog getting beat, running up and down the stairs, peeing. When my partner reached for Berry to put on her leash so they can leave, she flinched and continued to pee.

When Tim approaches Valiente, he rolls over in fear and submission. Ever since Jack and I have been showing the bare minimum of attention to Valiente, he stays by us the very little time he has outside of the cage and then gets in trouble for it. Tim yells at him to go back to his bed, and he just lays there looking back and forth between us and Tim. Jack will nicely say, ""Go to bed,"" and Valiente will go.

Aside from the beatings, Tim rarely takes Valiente outside. Valiente only gets a few seconds outside to use the bathroom by a tree right outside the apartment building before Tim brings him right back in. Tim will be out for maybe a total of two minutes - between going down and up two flights of stairs in the building, it’s hard to believe that he spends more than even one minute outside. He gets water and a cup of Purina dry dog food once a day if he goes outside - he only gets fed after the one time he goes outside. Valiente knows nothing beyond the tree he goes to for the bathroom. There is a park at the end of the block he lives at. Valiente has been there maybe three times in about two years since Tim has had him.

Recently, he’s been having a couple of accidents in the house because he hasn’t been taken out, and Tim laughs. Tim threw out Valiente's bed because he accidentally peed on it. It also looks like Valiente is losing weight because his ribs are becoming more prominent.

Jack and I are moving to a new place in December and are planning a rescue for this dog. We are planning on documenting evidence of the abuse and calling animal services then rescuing Valiente from the shelter. Another plan is to find out Valiente's microchip company and change the title of ownership without Tim - Chad is willing to help.

If you have any advice, we are more than willing to listen and consider it. We fear this dog will die at the hands of Tim. Also, Tim wants to get a puppy, so how can we blacklist Tim to prevent him from beating another dog?

Update: Valiente is ok right now, there has not been any further beatings and Jack & Chad are trying to take Valiente out for walks while Tim is out. Thank you to those who are kind in the comments. As straightforward as it sounds to beat up Tim and to confront him and release the dog - it’s not as simple as it sounds. There is limited space in Philadelphia, PA in no-kill and kill shelters so the chances of him getting euthanized for his behavior and personality and not being able to get adopted is high. Valiente can’t roam the streets because he’s not familiar with being outside so I doubt he’d be able to survive and he’s not an easy rescue. Sadly Valiente also “loves” Tim so there’s a good chance he’d Stick around if he was just let out. There is no easy solution here. Jack and I can’t do anything to really rescue him until we move into our new place. As of now all that can be done is gain evidence and try to step in if it’s too bad. Also note that Tim is a quick to physical aggression hot head to confronting him isn’t easy. Tim has left holes in his walls and doors and destroyed cabinet doors so it’s not exactly easy to talk to him. Jack also doesn’t have anywhere to stay right now other than with Tim so it’s hard to speak up every time when Tim can potentially kick out Jack and then Jack is no longer in a position to help as much. We have no where else to keep Valiente safely. All our other friends have dogs or cats and Valiente doesn’t know how to regulate his own emotions so living with another animal in the household without someone who knows how to handle and train dogs is near to impossible - in this case Jack has been training dogs for a few years. Yes this situation sucks and our plays here are difficult. We set up a gofundme for the additional expenses that come with rescuing him. I’ll keep y’all updated. ",2023-11-22 05:27:56
My dog crossed the rainbow bridge yesterday,"My girl passed away yesterday. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But her being unable to walk was just so sad. It wasn't even walking too, but that was the main reason. She had fatty tumors on her belly, constant reoccurring skin infections, really bad allergies. Just all of that made her miserable. And for the past 2 months it was getting worse. She whined whenever I touched her, especially around her belly and legs. She used to love belly rubs.. so I definitely knew it was time.


I feel bad I wasn't able to get her outside before I put her down. She loved sitting outside in the sun. But sadly I just couldn't find a way to move her without putting her in pain. I didn't think all that pain would be worth it to go outside, so I'm feeling guilty for that. But she got a good meal and was spoiled in her final days. She was an amazing dog with the silliest and most kind personality I've seen in a dog. She never growled or barked at anyone. She loved on every single person she met.

I did at home euthanasia and it was so peaceful  for her. And when the first injection hit her, I could tell it was taking away the pain. She seemed happier in that moment. Then it knocked her out and she started snoring, which made me giggle a bit since her snores are funny sounding. Then the vet did the final injection and wow.. it made her Pass instantly 

It feels so empty without her now. I don't hear tip taps anymore. No more loud goofy snoring. No more giving me those adorable eyes for food. The constant love she showed...gone. it hurts. 

I know I did the right thing though. She was in so much pain that she didn't even want to go outside, that's no way for a dog to live. I wish I did it a little earlier, but I'm still glad I didn't let her go through pain even longer, because honestly I don't think she would have lasted another month. Her health was declining fast.

Sorry for any spelling and grammar errors, I'm crying so it's hard to see lol",2023-11-21 20:33:11
Is it bad to feel bad about getting another animal?,"I have a dog and a cat that I love and cherish dearly. The other day my partner stumbled upon a lost kitten. It was cold and windy so I decided to take the little guy in because I felt incredibly bad for him. The little dude has become incredibly attached to me and I'm ruining about keeping him in case we can't find his original owners (if he even has any). The issue is with this is that I've found myself feeling incredibly guilty over wanting to keep this new kitten. I feel as though I'm making my current pets feel replaced/abandoned by this new addition and it's really making me reconsider keeping the kitten, but I can't just get rid of him either because that's unfair to him incase he doesn't have anyone else. I'm not sure what to do over this situation because of this feeling and I genuinely could use some advice on how to deal with this.",2023-11-21 13:17:32
PSA: Do not buy Merry & Bright’s Claus’s Croissant Peanut Butter Dog Chews from PerSmart! They are making dogs sick!,"I gave my dogs HALF of one of these today and he started vomiting everywhere. Checked the reviews online and low and behold, they’re all one star reviews saying the same thing- their dogs got sick after eating these. I called PetSmart’s customer service but the rep told me they’re unable to initiate recalls, but if I want a refund I can get one in store. If you have these, throw them out, otherwise STAY AWAY from them (and probably all of the other season treats!)",2023-11-21 10:01:59
"Looking to own a pet but have obstacles...need advice, opinions, and suggestions","Hi, I'm looking to own a pet, either dog or cat, but I have some problems that I want other pet owners' to give me suggestions on. I'll list my problems...

I live alone in an apartment where there's only a quad with a playground to roam around

Somewhat low income

I work 7 hours Tues-Sat

I have a disability unabling my ability to drive, forcing me use accommodation programs for transportation.

I have no prior experience in owning a dog or a cat

Those are what I can think of right now. And these problems make it feel like it's near impossible to comfortably own a house pet. If there are people out there with similar or close to similar situations like mine and own a pet comfortably, I'd like to know how to do it.

*Also I had this idea that, since I don't have any experience in pet owning or if I can't own a pet, that maybe I could volunteer at a local pet shelter and gain some pet owning experience, but I don't know how much pet owning experience I can gain from doing that, can I get some opinions on this idea too?*",2023-11-21 09:56:54
Wanting an animal companion.,"Hey, 
I'm looking for an advice on getting a pet. I don't have a garden, and have a very small flat. I work 9-10 hours 5 days a week but I am willing to spend hours walking and extra playing in my days of. I'm looking for a cuddly-er pet who can give me responsibility and comfort. I know I can't have a big dog or anything like that as it wouldn't be fair to the animal. Any ideas or suggestions?

"Have to leave my new kitten alone for the holiday, what do I do?","Hello! So I just adopted a kitten of 2 months old a few weeks ago with my partner, and he is just the cutest bundle of joy! We took him to the vet and we also made sure he has everything he needs to grow healthy and happy, but it just dawned on me that when me and my boyfriend will be out to meet our families (we are international students), the cat would only be ALMOST 4 months old (around three months and three weeks old). I have a friend cat sit for us as she already agreed, bu i dont think she s able to stay with our little guy every 6 hours, we initially thought just going twice a day would be enough, any advice? I could really use some experiences cat parents wisdom right now!🥲

EDIT: I have found a trusted friend that is a local in the city i am living with the kitten in that would be okay with keeping him. Of course he would be compensated accordingly to the prices of a cat sitter so of course money is not the issue here. I feel confident in this solution as the cat already knows the guy, and they get along really well. He is also a student but he only has coursework for home and only two days a week lessons. We will start bringing him over to his house once in a while so he gets more comfortable with the transition. For the actual advice and support, thank you to everyone ♥️ It is hard to get a kitten for the first time without having your parents support, but I am determined to make my little kittens life as good as it can be. I assure you i am not a negligent owner, as that is why i asked for advice a month before the actual event, so i can be prepared. For everyone saying that it was a bad plan and decision to get a cat now, please understand that here are circumstances that i am not comfortable discussing on Reddit. I know you cant trust me when I say there was no better option than to adopt this kitten at this exact moment, but I hope you find the kindness to not assume the worst. I have had more than 10 pet cats along the years. I have been a shelter volunteer, I am familiar with kittens and how they need to be handled. It is though much different when you own one yourself and that’s why i needed a bit of extra help. Right now the timing is bad with my family visit coming up, but just know that I do not plan on taking long trips again; i did not plan it after i got the kitten, the tickets have been paid for months in advance, but i will be sure to not book any more trips, this is just a rocky start and i understand that, maybe we can all find compassion and comfort knowing that the little guy will be safe while im away, and then forever be part of a good and loving household that will not leave his side♥️",2023-11-21 06:06:03
Rehoming our dog,"Well, rehoming doesn't really fit here, but let me explain. We took our rescue dog Luna 5 years ago. She has been our princess, spoiled af, love her to bits. We had a baby 5 months ago, and we are doing our best to make sure she feels loved and cared for. Here is the problem: we live in a pretty remote little farm, surrounded by forests, lovely place. But with a baby (and my husband's recent cancer scare) we have been overwhelmed by all the chores that need to be constantly done, so we decided to move into an apartment in the city. We didn't even consider not taking Luna with us until my father said something. See, the farms used to belong to my parents, and they did exactly what we are doing- moved closer to the city so us kids could socialize more. Now that we are looking for a new place, my father has been excited to move back to the farm. Last time we spoke about it, he had a huge smile on his face, talking about all he will do on the farm, and added ""I think you should stay here with me, Luna! We'll take walks and play and so on"". It got me thinking. Never thought about leaving her, but would it be better? She loves the outdoors, and she loves my father. They truly have a great bond, and he will definitely have a lot more time for her than we do, and she wouldn't be stuck in an apartment being annoyed by a toddler. But I also don't want her to feel abandoned. I don't know what is better, and I just want her to be happy. What do you think? I'm desperate for advice.",2023-11-20 16:32:12

Neighbours cat keeps shitting in my garden and I'm fed up with it and nothing seems to be preventing the cat from getting into the garden,"I have a lovey garden, a lovely patio with plants on both sides, a bird feeder , a birth bath and a lovely sitting erea for the summer. The neighbours cat has been a huge problem since they moved in a couple months ago. The cat has broken various pots and he completely ruined my flowers by sitting or sleeping on them or ripping them up or whatever it is they do. Cat shit is all in my garden and it's just ruined my lovely garden. I have spoke to the neighbour many times now and she just does not care , apparently she can't control the cat when it's outside. We'll done let it out then or don't have one at all if you can't look after it. I have now put spikes alongside the fence and gate but it just looks horrible. That didn't keep the cat out so I brought one of those things that makes a horrible noise when anything is in the garden. That hasn't helped at all and I don't what to do. I have already spent £100 on stuff to try and keep the cat out and nothing has worked. Any ideals will be greatly appreciated",2023-11-20 04:44:37
Leaving my cats for a week. Should I get them an “automatic” feeder?,"I have two boys (8 and 7 months) and I’ll be leaving them for about a week during the holidays. I’ll have my mother and a close friend to come by once a day to clean their toilets and keep them company.
The issue is that they are on a feeding schedule - morning and evening and I’m not sure my “babysitters” would be able to come by for the morning meal so I was thinking about getting two of those “automatic” feeders that are not really automatic ( the upside down containers that you fill with food and it just disposes as the cat eats).

Do you think it is a good idea to calculate the amount of food they need and just fill two of those?
I’m afraid they might eat it faster than supposed to although they won’t be left without if anyone notices.",2023-11-20 01:06:25

Senior dog quality of life? Vet was dismissive,"So, my parents have an English bulldog that’s over 10yo now. I’m hoping for some advice for judging when it might be her time.

She’s been peeing herself a lot these days. She’s been extremely slow when going on walks for a while now, and could only walk a very limited distance. Recently it’s gotten to the point where she refuses to go, even refuses to go out to pee in the garden. When she does go out, she sometimes doesn’t poop, and ends up getting sick (vomiting/diarrhea) later on. My mum said she sometimes seems really confused. Like when she takes her out so she can pee/poop, but she looks like she doesn’t know what’s happening. She has also started showing signs of aggression when it comes to getting her out of the house. Her hearing is quite poor as well, and she’s blind in one eye. 

She still wants/likes to play, but can’t physically handle it for more than a minute. She drinks and eats normally. She actually gets very hyped up at meal times. My mum said it’s almost like she saves all her energy the whole day so she can be hyper and jump excitedly when it’s food time. She still gets excited when my dad comes home. She’s inactive at all other times.

Overall I think she’s definitely struggling with joint pain (she’s a bulldog after all), and she might also have dementia. My mum took her to the vets for her boosters, and mentioned some of the issues regarding her wetting herself and struggling to walk. Unfortunately, the usual vet wasn’t there (it’s his clinic and he was always the only vet there, no clue why there was someone else this time). 

This guy was overall very dismissive, and told my mum to get the dog to lose 1 kg of weight (note: she’s not overweight, her weight is healthy, my mum is strict with her diet to make sure of that), and that will reduce her pain and help. He didn’t offer painkillers or address the fact that she’s already quite old for her breed. I thought the vet would have given some information  on quality of life for elderly dogs. There were some other very ignorant things he said about my mum’s accent etc, so overall I don’t have a very good opinion of him, and don’t trust his judgement at all. 

So yeah, I guess she’s going to need another vet visit with her usual vet to get some better advice. But I was hoping people here might have some input as well. I don’t think she has long left, but how do we judge when her quality of life is too low to keep her going? When writing down a list of all the things she struggles with already, it feels like she’s always past that point. But then again, she still gets very happy and has a very good appetite, and I wonder how much better she’s be if her joint pain was reduced. My mum is putting her on a diet as advised, but I don’t know if that’s really good to make a big difference. ",2023-11-18 20:11:51
"We're putting our dog down tomorrow, what do I do with the other one?","My dog (12m) has a later stage of cancer and will be put down tomorrow in the comfort of our home. We're all here for him, my sister and her fiance came from Minnesota to be here for him. But our other dog (6f)  may not comprehend what's happening. We intent on being with him as he passes in our yard and keeping her inside. Do I we bring her outside with us while he passes or will she understand as time passes that he's not around? She stays with my sister but for the next week she'll be at our house. What do we do? How do we make her understand the dog she's been with her entire life is gone?



I'm pretty drunk right now. I'm not ready for my dog to pass but I know he's in pain.


Edit #1: thanks everyone. We'll have our other dog come out after the act has happened. It's a hard time I've been hiding my sadness from him and barely am keeping it under control for my family. The vet will be here in 15-20 minutes.


Update: My best friend is gone. We brought our other dog out after he passed. She did not understand until we moved the body. We're all grieving right now, she's trying to give everyone attention. ",2023-11-18 09:42:22
"Our dog just passed away, I need help making sense of what happened to him","He was just 4 years old, male, healthy, until one day he seemingly fell on his hind legs while trying to climb into the back seat of our stationary sedan. He seemed fine other than a niggle in his right hind thigh and leg, for 3-4 days he limped but he was able to move around on his own no problem. He rapidly deteriorated from day 4-5 onwards though. 

Day 2 after fall - He had peed inside the house, which he never does. We didn’t think much of it, we thought it was an accident.

Day 4/5- Wouldn’t get up at all, wasn’t moving and when he did move, he was dragging his hind legs as if they were paralysed. Vet said it looked it ‘nerve damage’, no X-rays were taken for some reason. 

Day 6-14 - he was bedridden with incontinence and we left no stone unturned to ensure he was clean and dry, but it was very hard. He wouldn’t allow us to flip him to the other side for a good 3 days, he laid on his good side the whole time. Every time we tried to flip him, he would whine and yowl in pain and struggled, so we gave up out of fear of aggrevating his injury/nerve damage by moving him too much. We had a vet tech help flip him after 3 days on one side. He developed sores all over his body by day 14, while vets gave him intravenous painkillers. They didn’t seem to help because he would regularly whine and cry in pain. 

Day 15 - His stool was dark red and there was blood in his urine. He is losing weight, refusing to eat solid foods, drinking copious amounts of water though. 

Day 16 - Looks extremely frail before passing away in our arms. 

I feel like his vets failed us, they could have done so much more. I have no idea why he deteriorated the way he did. Does anyone have any clue what it could have been? Im desperately looking for closure, my baby didn’t deserve to pass like this.

Edit - To clarify, we did get a second, third and fourth opinion for him. We went to 4 different vet hospitals, all of them prescribed painkillers, steroids, muscle sprays and vitamin supplements. They advised against x-rays as he was crying and whining in pain, their reasoning was they didn’t want to aggrevate the nerve damage. I still feel like some tests could have been done, which is why we kept going door to door at vet hospitals to get consultations even until his last day.",2023-11-18 01:21:21

Over the past 2 months, he's started throwing up a few times a week at night, changing food preferences daily, drinking more water, sleeping more. He used to get about half dry food, half wet food but he stopped eating dry food completely and will only occasionally eat wet food. Sometimes he'll devour a whole can but usually he'll sniff it, not eat it, and cry for different food. We've tried dozens of foods. A van he likes one day, he won't eat the next day. We've taken him to the vet so many times, he's had blood tests, ultrasounds, xrays. We took him into urgent care tonight because he's eaten almost nothing in 2 days. They have no idea what's wrong. He's lost 20% of his body weight. I hear his stomach growling so loud for food all day. He won't eat. I have no idea what to do.

ETA: Thank you everyone for all the advice. He did a little better over the weekend. When we got back from urgent care I sat up with him and he devoured two servings of wet food and I felt a lot better. It seems like he's fighting whatever it is and not just giving up.

My 15 year old Jack Russell Terrier is scheduled for dental surgery to remove 22 of his teeth. Is this cruel & selfish to do to my dog?,"Ok so prior to discovering my Jack Russell needed dental surgery, he was still a fairly strong dog, at least for his age(15) He has a bit of arthritis, his legs shake a bit when he walks but he still likes to take walks (although shorter & more leisurely ones) he can run up & down the stairs w/no problems, he still chases birds at the beach (albeit for much shorter spurts than before) he still gets the zoomies when we’re eating & zooms back & forth between everyone, doing his few tricks for treats. He has (seemingly) no mental decline at all, no incontinence, still can see & hear (tho naturally it’s less so than his younger self) still has a strong appetite. He’s obviously not a young pup, he can’t jump up on the bed anymore and he sleeps a lot more than he used to, but his quality of his life was still good.

Then, my parents took him for a teeth cleaning & were turned away bc he had infection in his mouth & likely needed teeth removed. The vet informed them that he needed 22 teeth removed. My parents were indecisive, it was a very $$$ surgery for a senior dog, but I pushed & they agreed. Now we have the surgery scheduled for tmrw, & whereas my main concern before this was the anesthesia, earlier tonight a few people said some alarming things. They basically implied that he’s much too old, & that putting them thru the surgery is cruel & selfish, & that if he even makes it thru the surgery, he could very well die afterwards from the trauma & pain. 

I know there is always risk w/anesthesia, & any surgical procedure, my main concern is that he suffers uneccessarily bc of my unwillingness to say goodbye. The vet seemed to be unwilling to make recommendation & said it was my choice. Does anyone else have experience with this, veterinary expertise or opinions on the matter?  Any input is greatly appreciated!!

******************************************************** UPDATE: My senior boy had his surgery and was already up & peppy by the time I picked him up! He was waiting for me tail wagging & he even jumped into the car which he hasn’t done by himself in forever! You would never have guessed that he had just had surgery, he was such a happy boy! He seemed to have little to no recovery time, he gobbled up his wet food, & was back home immediately trying to get into everyone’s business & wiggling under the baby gate so as not to be left out! 

Now it’s 4 days post op and he’s the happiest boy, he’s got a new pep in his step, & has so much more energy than he did before! I’m SO glad we got the surgery done, I can’t believe I was considering putting him down bc of this. That would have been the biggest mistake of my life and I would have never even known it. Now I get more time with my sweet boy. Thank you so much to everyone that commented and helped convince me it was the right thing to do!!!! ",2023-11-16 16:46:37

"I have to leave my cats for 6 months, will they be okay?","For some context, my cats are brothers and both two years old. They love each other and me immensely, I am especially bonded to one of them. I lived in my moms house with my little brother, his girlfriend and my mom. They’re both extremely affectionate, slept with me every night and cuddled with me for comfort when they needed.

My mom suddenly got a work opportunity in Ireland and left in September, she will be returning in April. Mind you my cats were also very bonded to her (the one I’m not as bonded with was bonded with my mom). I had to move out of my moms house just under a month ago because she was renting out my room to afford her living in Ireland. I’m living with my dad now temporarily and unfortunately taking them with me wasn’t an option.

I’m just worried that first with my mom leaving & now me that they won’t be okay. They still do have my brother and his girlfriend (who they’ve also been with since they were kittens and love & my brother’s girlfriend’s cat is their dad) and live with them in the basement apartment of my moms house so they’re not experiencing any change of housing. I just feel so guilty and angry with my mom for leaving and hoping my cats will be okay. Will they remember me when I move back in April? Will they hate me and my mom? Are they going to be depressed?

Update to HELP!! Roommate doesn't take care of his dog,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/s/2rLmMeFtaz

Here's a link to my original post about a month ago. I had a couple people asking for updates, so I figured I'd make one. 

This story has a happy ending. 

I didn't end up reporting roomate to law enforcement. Instead I took over full care of this GSD/Belgian Mal mix. I still had to work full time of course. But I told roomate to fuck off and let me take care of dog. 

So to be clear I've never had a dog and I've had seldom practice training a dog. So I gave myself a crash course in dog training and did my best. He learned how to sit, stay, fetch, walk, and how to handle himself around other dogs (no direct contact because I didn't want any incidents). Of course he wasn't perfect but its amazing how smart these dogs are. I became a lot less afraid of him once we started spending a lot of time together. We went on some pretty cool adventures together. The reason I did this is because I didn't want him to be put down for aggressive behavior. 

I kept him clean and on a schedule. Only one cage accident since I took over care. His bones didn't poke out nearly as much either. And he started to behave really really well (as much as a puppy can lol) and he really took a liking to me too.

Unfortunately, there's no way I could afford pay to get him up to date on all his shots and he was a big time commitment that wasn't sustainable long term for me. So I ended up taking him back to the shelter where he was adopted from. I won't lie, I cried. Crazy how attached you can get in such a short amount of time. But I know he's going to go to a good home. A few days before he left I scrounged some money to buy him a couple real toys and a blanket. I slept with the blanket for a few nights for my scent and sent it with him so hopefully he would be less scared. 


I told a few friends about him and what shelter he's at and they're actually looking at possibly adopting him! So maybe I'll get to see him again one day. Fingers crossed. 

As for those wondering about roommate: this might not be the ending you hoped for but I didn't report him. I'm just moving out. I don't want anything else left to do with this person. I told shelter about what happened and he's banned from getting another pet through them. That's the best I can do. Good fucking riddance. 

Thanks for reading. And bless you all and your furry friends.",2023-11-15 08:55:33

Am I doing the wrong thing by putting my elderly and sick dog down?,"
I decided that im going to put my dog (11F) down within the next two week. Her arthritis and allergies have just gotten so bad.

For background, my dog had to get surgery at 2 due to a deformed left leg. The surgeon pretty much had to break it and pin it to a position like a proper leg. The vet told us the leg will probably stop working around the age of 10. He mentioned how that will shorten her lifespan then.

Well shortly after the surgery, she developed horrible allergies. They were so bad she would get multiple skin infections in a year. Should would also cough a lot. We tried apoquel, cytopoint and even immunotherapy. Nothing worked. The only thing that did work was prednisone.. and that's obviously not good for dogs long term use. She also has this giant cyst or tumor in her left ear. They did surgery to remove it 2 Years ago but then it grew back. The vets are afraid to do surgery again based on her condition. It's causing reoccurring ear infections, even when I clean it.

Two months ago, her left leg started to give out. She can still walk, but the left leg is very stiff. Her hips are also noticeably slanted. She can't even get on a sidewalk curb, if she does, it takes her a minute and I have to help her. She can get up for food and water, but she sits down when she eats and drinks now because she can't support herself for long. And when she's does try to get to the food and water, it takes her a bit since she can only walk 2 feet then sits for a break because it tires her just to get water. I too her to the vet and got her on pain meds and it can tell it helped her pain a little, but she still can barely walk. I asked the vet when would be the good time to put her down, he said when she can't eat,drink, play, or get up. And she's still eating and drinking, so I'm still confused.

4 weeks ago she also developed the worst skin infection I've seen on her. It was the worst around her spine but it was still all over. She's been on antibiotics for 4 weeks now and her skin has shown some improvement, but the infection is still there. And I'm sure if it does clear up, it will return shortly. I can't even give her proper baths anymore since she can't stand for long. But I do my best at bathing her still.

When her left leg started to give out, she was still able to have the enegy to walk outside and to pee and poo. Now she doesn't want to go outside at all. I almost got her to but then she just collapsed. I tried using some sling thing under her, but she hates it and refuses to move. I assume it really hurts her hips. So instead I have to put pee pads in the house. She will get up to use those. But she just still doesn't want to go outside, even when she cries because she needs to go potty. Oh, and when I took her to the vet a couple weeks ago, the vet tech had to carry her out because she didn't have enough energy to walk back out. 


I feel so guilty. I feel like I haven't done enough to help her. Such as hydro therapy. But with her skin and lung issues, i dont even know if she could handle it. I cant put her on joint suppliments since all the ones ive seen have yeast and shes severly allergic to it. I've had people recommended me arthritis medication instead, but i dont even know if that would help her left leg since it has a pin in it. I've already spent thousands and thousands on her this year alone. I've happily drained my bank account multiple times for her because I love her. But I also don't know how much I can keep doing that for her. And i dont want to keep spending thousands to keep her alive just for myself. I'm not sure if it's fair for her since she's in pain. But she's also eating, drinking, and has her happy moments. But I think she's getting to the point where she's having more bad days than good.

I'm pretty sure I'm going to put her down this week or next week. But I don't know if I'm really making the right decision. I feel so guilty just thinking about it. I love her so much. I feel like a bad owner for not doing all this Lazer surgery or a bunch of different types of medications.

Sorry for the long post. I'm an emotional wreck right now and don't know what to do. This is literally the hardest decision I've had to made. I'm not even sure if I should take her to the vet again before I out her down.",2023-11-14 21:33:50
My sister isn't taking the passing of our pet well.,"TL;DR: sister is having a hard time after the passing of our dog, Foxy. How did you move on from the passing of your beloved pet? Any advice? Any stories you wish to share? 

---------

After a mounting number of medical problems, my family's 14-year-old dog departed this world this past July. Even after suffering from heart disease and pancreatitis, she was still living a good life with the appropriate meds. But, as you know, this just buys some time. As an effect of her heart disease, and her physically big heart, there was a tear in the sack around her heart. That lead to the liquid in the sack surrounding the heart to leak into her lung cavity, causing her breathing difficulties. Then cluster seizures started coming in. We knew it was bad when the vet put a bell around her neck so they could be alerted when she seizures. At that point, we all inherently knew it was time to let her go. When they wheeled her in, she was still convulsing from her last major seizure. My whole family was there for my dog. We held her and talked to her until she left us.


Being first time dog owners, this experience was so traumatic for all of us. For about a month afterwards, my mom would still walk the usual route she took our dog out for her morning walks. My dad had to go to the hospital because his already weak heart, due to a recent open heart quadruple bypass surgery, was not handling the emotional stress well. I would also cry at nights in my room, waiting for the sounds of my dogs feet to sneakily come into my room and lay in her bed; a bed which I still have in my room. But in time, we all have recovered and moved on to an extent where we can continue our lives. But not my sister. She is still having a rough time.


To quote my sister, ""I don't want kids. Foxy *was* my child."" She feels the same loss right now as if she lost her child; and rightfully so. To all of us, Foxy was a family member and not a dog. But this is taking a toll on my sister. Whenever she visits our family home, she holds Foxy's urn while she chills on the couch, or does stuff around the house. In her apartment, she has huge photo prints of her and Foxy hanging on the wall with a table of candles underneath that she keeps lit 24/7. She also got one of those shadowbox frames so she could display some of Foxy's personal items. She calls me or my mom every few days to discuss the events leading to Foxy's passing, thus making us relive these traumatic moments; claiming that due to the trauma she doesn't remember much of that day. She still asks, ""And the doctor said there was nothing they could do? Did we ask the doctor about _____? Why did the doctor say ____? Do you feel they rushed us?"" She is still adamant that the vets ""rushed"" our decision, because after informing us of her cluster seizures, she asked to just ""see"" Foxy, but they rolled her in on a gurney, thus subtly trying to force our decision. 


Anyway, every time she calls it turns into an hour reliving of those events for my mom and I, but we do it because we want to support her. I tried taking her to a movie, but she broke down crying as we got to the theater, saying, ""I can't do this. I can't go back to normal life. I miss Foxy."" So I drove her back home. I tired to take her to Puppy Yoga to find her love of dogs again, but she didn't have a good time. To quote her, ""it just isn't the same."" She is even upset at herself because she hasn't seen Foxy in her dreams. To her that means that Foxy was upset at her and doesn't want to see her. I could go on. She just spends her days in her apartment and work. That's all. Doesn't go out.

I guess what I'm asking here is, how did you ""move on"" from the passing of your beloved pet? I don't know how else to help my sister other than talking to her about her trauma and trying to get her out of her apartment every now and then. We can't afford therapy, so that's out of the question. So I'm stuck in this place where I'm seeing my sister stuck in this negative mental place, not getting better, and there's nothing that I'm doing that is helpful. Or is it helpful? I don't know. Anyway, feel free to share your stories or advice. It's all welcome.",2023-11-14 19:57:36

is it weird/bad to cry after adopting a pet?,"every time i adopt a new pet, whether it be birds, cats, dogs, i get so stressed out that i end up sobbing that first day, maybe even a few days after if something goes wrong, they dont get along immediately, etc. i know this is irrational, and i always enjoy having a new baby in a few days time, but for that first day im just a mess.

i suppose what im asking is if anyone else experiences this? is it a sign that im doing something wrong/shouldnt be getting pets?

cat in ER.,"my boy is in the hospital tonight for a blockage in his urethra. 

they attempted the procedure tonight but his urethra is so swollen that they were unable to even fit the catheter in there to remove the crystal & debris blockage. they're trying anti inflammatory medication tonight and attempting the procedure again in the morning.

positive wishes, please. if you have any similar stories with happy endings…..please feel free to share them. ♡ 

UPDATE: the vet says he is doing well this morning. they are waiting for more doctors to attempt the procedure again. 

** they got the catheter in! I get to go visit him. 

** he was doing well when I visited him. the vets say he is a very good boi. they will update me tonight or in the morning about the status of the catheter & if he can pee without it. I’m hoping he can come home tomorrow night. 

FINAL UPDATE: he came home last night! he has a pretty heavy medication regime. he is doing well with peeing & eats his prescription food just fine. ♡ so happy to have kitty cuddles again. ",2023-11-13 12:56:02

My fish is pregnant and I don't want to keep the babies,"So I have three fishes in my tank. A goldfish and 2 mollies, a black one and an orange one. So I got these fishes at PetSmart but first I got the goldfish and then a couple of weeks later, I got the mollies together. They were in the same tank so I assumed they were both females or males. But then a couple months later I started seeing that the black mollie kept bother the orange one and at first I thought it was funny and cute. Until a couple of weeks passed and I noticed that her tummy grew a bit and my mom raised that concern to me too. We talked about it and I search it up, like maybe she's pregnant? And she is. She has that boxy shape, and getting closer to the heater. Because the black mollie keeps bothering her, she swims away so it's a cat an mouse chase. She's still eating well but I already know she'll be due soon, it's been a couple of weeks already. I saw that now she's getting some spots on her, so I think that's a sign. I moved the Goldfish and the black mollie to a previous tank I had when I only had the goldfish. I am a bit worried because honestly I don't want the babies. I didn't know that the two mollies were a male and a female, I thought they were the same gender to begin with because they were in the same tank in the pet store. I don't know what to do. I have read online to sell them but like, how? I assume that because mollies are cheap at the pet store, no one will want to buy them from me or like do I give them away for free? I know nothing about selling fish. I just want to know what I can do with the babies.",2023-11-12 13:44:16
"Dog hit by a car. We would pay her medical bill, but she's not legally ours.","I found out on the Neighbors app that the dog was hit by a car. She's a 2-year-old Siberian Husky. She's not our dog, but we know her so well because she comes to visit us every day and I do mean EVERY DAY. (She goes back home at night.) She is also underweight so we fed her every day.

I called animal services. They told me that officially, they couldn't comment on the situation because she is not our dog, but unofficially, they do have her and she will need surgery.

I called her owner multiple times, but no one picked up.

Legally speaking, if the owner doesn't pay for surgery, can we take ownership of the dog and pay for her surgery?

Let's just say that I have every reason to believe that her owner won't be able to afford her medical bill.

UPDATE: 💔

I had hoped that there would be a miracle.

At last, there was not.",2023-11-12 09:59:23
*UPDATE* BF brought cat to my house,"So I posted earlier in September about [my boyfriend wanting to bring his cat to my house](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/16lqvml/bf_wants_to_bring_cat_to_my_house/), for a trial period of 1 month. I was concerned because the cat is blind and not very social, I was worried the change might affect her very negatively.

So eventually he brought her in, and boy were we surprised. She was very brave from the first day to discover the rest of the house and from the first week she made herself at home.

She turned out to be this aggressively playful ball of spikes- I discovered she loves chasing balls of wrinkled  paper, attack my rags and destroy my hands. I don't believe she was being hostile; she would brush my hand for cuddles and then roll on her belly, which was an open invitation to war, and I obliged. Apparently she was also very dramatically vocal when she wanted attention (which was always to fight my hand, not so much for cuddles).

It was such a delight seeing her sprint (!!) on my living room to chase balls of paper.

The biggest achievement of all though: because she's been blind since very early in her kittenhood, she's scared of being put on surfaces, as she can't tell the height she's standing on, and she gets petrified. As a result, she stopped wanting to be put on the bed and sleep with my boyfriend very early. However, I saw her being very curious here about beds and sofas when we were on them. I put some short boxes to encourage her to get up herself and explore. At some point I came home to find my couch pillows on the floor and I was so happy that my plan was working. Only to sit on the couch and see her jump on it. There are no words for this creature.

My boyfriend would say that I transformed her into this hateful woman, because she is trying to engage in fighting all the time. Well, he took her back home a week ago (</3) and she is back to her usual self. Quiet, cuddly, kept to herself.

I firmly believe she needs a peer to interact with. She is two years old but still a kitten at heart.",2023-11-11 16:19:10
Please bring your Pets to the Vet!,"My parents refused to bring a male cat to the vet that had every sign his urinary tract was blocked, it took Shadow yelping and convulsing for them to finally panic and start calling any nearby clinics.

AITA for taking my family friends pet to the groomers?,"I’ve been so stressed about this and everyone said I did the right thing but I still feel bad. 

I’m watching a family friends pet that’s a standard poodle while they’re out of town. They’ve had him for almost a year now. Before watching him they said they were gonna take him to the groomers but when they drop him off that is not the case. 

I notice that he had like six dreads on both of his ears. I start to investigate and realize he has a ton of matted fur and dreads everywhere. I’m start to freak out because I can only imagine how painful this is for him. 

Normally I would call and mention something but I know that they’re very cheap and frugal. They would tell me to not bother or to not spend my money on it but I don’t care I want to spend money so the dog can feel good. 

I ended up taking the dog to the groomers and they said it was bad but they’ll work on it. I get a call 10 minutes later saying that it’s way worse and they need to shave A LOT. I feel so bad because I know the owners are obsessed with how his hair is and I know they’ve complained about previous groomers bad cuts before. 

They’re out of town for 5 more days. They get back Tuesday. Should I tell them? If so how? Do I wait till they get back? Did I make a huge mistake? I’m stressing a lot about this. My wife said I should have left him but I felt so bad! They NEVER leave or travel so this is a big deal. I feel a ton of guilt over this. That they’ll be mad and never forgive this.



Edit for anyone who is still here. 

The owners know now. A third friend who encouraged me to get him groomed told them and took the heat. He grilled them a bit about how they knew he needed to be groomed and how it’s their fault for waiting this long. They were a bit upset and said they were planning on getting him groomed when they return. Which was something I was worried about. I haven’t talked to them personally. I was planning on telling them the day before they get back. We shall see. ",2023-11-10 05:57:39
What is something your pet does that you did not realise until way later?,"We had a situation with our cat, that was actually quite funny and endearing and I wanted to share and hear from you all.
Funny, creepy, sweet...all of it allowed!

Here it goes:

We have an in-built closet with sliding doors in our office and I kept on finding it with the door open quite frequently. I always ended up closing it, only to find it open again. I assumed it must be my husband who keeps on getting stuff there and just can't be bothered to close the door again. 

At some point we go into the room and the door is open again, and I bring it up. ""Can you please close the door when you are done with whatever you need here?"", and close the door. My husband claiming that it wasn't him, he hadn't been there in weeks, me bickering that it probably happens on it's own - you know how those arguments go. 

While we are still at it, our cat walks in, straight to the closet, opens the door and swoops inside.

Turns out, the little devil had learned how to open sliding doors and made himself a little sleeping book between some clothes. 
I apologised and we had a good laugh.",2023-11-09 22:37:05
"Me and my wife took in a Feral cat, or so we thought.","We had a sweet cat show up at our property, a little white furred fella with orange spots, he was very friendly but was clearly in a bit of a rough state. We coaxed him inside, fed him and gave him water, he had what appeared to be bites all over his nose and we could see he had a lot of fleas so we went up to Petco and got a flea comb and Frontline, I spent a while combing him as much as he'd let me and after removing probably close to 30 to 40 fleas we put the Frontline on him and over the next couple days leading up to a vet visit we were able to get the fleas we could find down to 1 or 0 a day. The vet visit comes, his nose is nearly fully healed and his flea situation is under control, we intend to just have a general health check up and get his vaccines.
 Turns out he is chipped and he has an owner and the owner had marked him missing 48 hours after we brought him inside. We end up leaving him with the Vet and obviously we were upset but it is what it is.  I go to work the next day and when I come home at 4pm he is sitting in our carport near our door, so the owners got their cat back that had been missing for 10 days and let him out near immediately... but worse still, he is absolutely covered in fleas again and I pulled easily 20 to 25 fleas off of him over the course of a couple hours. Is this a normal amount of fleas for an outdoor cat to pick up in one day of being outside with medication or is his owners house likely infested? I'm feeling really shitty about having to not let him inside right now and wondering if there is a way to more permanently help this sweet boy.",2023-11-09 12:31:39

Should I be concerned I found three cats in a car?,"This may not be the place to ask, but tbh I’m not sure where would be.

 I was walking my dog this morning and I was passing a car when I thought I saw a cat. On a second look I saw there were at least three. The windows were cracked open, and the temp isn’t getting higher than 80 and lower than 50 so it’s not necessarily dangerous for them to be in there. 

That being said, cars on my street don’t move very often, and I’m not sure how long they’ve been there and if I simply was too tired to notice other mornings (this was at 5:45 in the morning my time, about 30 mins ago).

Presumably there was no food or water in there. They seemed more stressed that I was inspecting the car and had seen them than stressed at the situation, so I wasn’t sure if I should be concerned or not. Presumably they were pets because I couldn’t find a way in and/or out of the car that a cat could use.

Any thoughts? Should I even be concerned?


Edit: Per a couple of my comments, went back on my lunch break, car and cats were gone, so even if they weren’t supposed to be in there everything should’ve been taken care of. Thanks for the help everyone!",2023-11-08 21:17:17
Kitty ate two dishwasher pods last week,"I realize all pets are different, but I wanted to share this experience.

I got a new dishwasher last week. I hadn't realized at the time, but when maintenance installed it, they pulled out the pod container & trash bags & set them to the side.

The next morning, I walked into the dining area & saw two pods, both half ""disentigrated."" The liquid part was the side that was missing.

I realized pretty quick the only explanation was my weirdo cat! The container was open, so I knew he had gotten into it.

I immediately freaked out. I went into my room and screamed at both the sleeping cats. They seemed fine.

Called the vet & they said the vet couldn't find anything toxic in the pods, that I could bring kitty in for some kind of poison control deal, but it would be $120. 

Watched him for two days. He didn't throw up once or seem lethargic at all.

So, if any of you happen to be unlucky enough to experience the same, chances are your pets will be just fine.

Cats really do have nine lives! But now I'm wondering if kitty has some kind of deficiency that causes him to eat strange things. He almost seems OCD sometimes.

That was a long ramble, but I had to share!",2023-11-08 02:47:26
Euthanasia..is it time?,"Euthanasia..

Hello everyone,

I’m crying as im writing this but i do need some support/help or just a simple advice.

I have a 14 year old male chow chow named Spike.Spike is the most kind dog in the world and i love him so much.Sadly for the past few months he started having problems walking.He couldn’t stand up by himself,started to soils himself and cries a lot.A lot…The last month everything went down pretty badly as he was getting sicker and sicker every single day.Rapidly.Few days ago when i woke up and went to see him,he couldn’t move his legs anymore.It’s like he’s paralysed.He is trying to stand up,hes hitting his head on the ground and his paws are breeding from the trying.My vet told me it’s time a couple months ago but i wasn’t having it.My dog is eating,drinking water and fighting to live.So i was doing everything i can to help him walk and feel like a normal and healthy dog.But this week when that happened i started to think maybe its time.Everyone in my family is telling me that we have to euthanise him,but i just can’t.Im thinking about it every single day trying to live this moment in my head so it calms me down a bit but i still cant pick up the phone and call my vet.Anyone who went through the same thing?How?Thank you for listening guys..",2023-11-07 20:47:29

Update on my dog ate two whole rotisserie chickens,"hi! There is just going say so many comments and help trying to reply to all so I thought I’d give a little context 


Updated a little bit for context: thank you so much for your replies! A lot of the suggestions we have tried such as snuffle mats, frozen mats, toys etc, we have a couple suggestions I never seen before and I ordered for him last night! We have tried training no success after 6 months with the fucking shit up and we moved on to a new trainer . He has been to 3 different vets and literally all of them say hes happy , healthy perfect, hes Just well CHAOS  he acts like a perfect angel on walks besides giving up and literally anywhere else but home lol. we will also be investing in an impact cage and signing him up with a company that comes to you 3X a week with a doggy treadmill called rundawg to get his energy out . we do go on multiple walks a day but I should have mentioned he’s lazy and crazy all at the same time. He goes absolutely nuts and have a great time the first 15-20 then gets absolutely tired and I have to literally pick up this 106 pound dog to get him home because he just refuses to move when he’s done . Our last walk of the night where he’s off leash , just playing fetch or sniff and find in our neighborhood fenced area he can go for a good hour or two . Just won’t walk during the day when we take the baby with us . When it’s just us he’s ready to go!!any tips of keeping him motivated would be great or do i just wait till hes ready to go again? As soon we get home it’s like he held his energy for demon time💀. 
After his vet appointment they have been talking about medication if adding the treadmill and a couple other things to his schedules do not work because truly we tried everything. 

one thing that is helping; I did immediately go get a baby gate to block the kitchen and dogs are not allowed . some people also bought up anxiety as it only nap time and being away from my son (3) you may have cracked the fucking code lol. Usually we crate him for nap time . I bought up the factor he’s obsessed with my son he stars at this kid like he hung the stars in the sky, he never leaves his side and truthfully that dog just loves that kid. They play fetch for hours together and he purposely tries to go lay on my son or under him as soon as he notices he gets sleepy . When I would take him upstairs and lay him down closing the door is when hell ,would break lose he would be scavenging in like anxiety mode even though he’s fed , literally breaking down the cage to get upstairs chewing on shit when he couldn’t get in the room, I left the cage open the door open and let him be . no chewing today lol . No demon time so far. Lol . he just walks upstairs stares at him with a big goofy smile , and comes back down and lays with me . I’ve never seen him so calm in my life? I truly am now thinking he was having separation anxiety from my son. he has his own cage and place in his room that he stays in at night I feel he may be missing apart of the pack when I put him in the cage downstairs for nap time and that was on me for not realizing it sooner . Gonna continue with this and the other tips and hopefully this will be the start of a retire of Dr. Hannibal Lecter wrath of chaos lol. 

As for rehome comments: not an option, I love this dog and if I have to literally re arrange my whole house and Continue to find things to help him . I will.",2023-11-07 02:48:30
My neighbor is abusing his puppy. Cops don’t seem to care,"I think my neighbor is abusing his dog-cops don’t care

I live in an apartment complex. My neighbor recently got a puppy. Every night when he comes home from work he starts screaming at the dog and it starts crying and screaming. You can hear him hitting it and see through the blinds. I have several audio/video recordings. 

I have called the cops 4 times and tonight when they came I made a report. They basically spoke to the guy and told him to “get a good night of sleep” after he told them he as work in the morning. I showed them the videos and it just feels like they don’t care.

My neighbor told the cops that the dog just cries when it’s lonely. I’m so sorry but I have dogs, everyone in this complex has dogs. They all cry and bark but NOT like that. I mean it’s screaming and he’s yelling…you can hear him hitting it!! It’s very disturbing to hear. 

The cops SAW AND HEARD the multiple videos I have and just don’t care! I’m so frustrated and upset. Half the time it sounds like he is just straight up killing the dog! 

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t even feel safe anymore. I’m going to the apartment manager first thing in the morning. There HAS to be something I can do…but the police don’t care.

ETA: Neighbor said that he is punishing the dog for having accidents in the apartment. That he can’t walk the dog because it’s not vaccinated and he doesn’t have a car to take it to get vaccinated.This has been going on for atleast a month. All pets must be registered with the city, which requires vaccination. All pets must be vaccinated. Why did he get a dog if he can’t care for it?! Why is he punishing the dog for something that’s HIS fault?!! I am just so frustrated and sick over this. ",2023-11-06 11:33:34
Help me find a pet that's suitable for me. 🥲," I'm very much a pet person and I NEED an animal in my life, but I've gone without a pet for the last six years because it seems like my living situation and needs are hopelessly incompatible with anything except fish and reptiles. I want a pet for the emotional connection.

The situation:

I work 8 hours or more a day.

I live alone in a 700 sq ft apartment.

I live in an area that's fairly unsafe to walk outside at night.

I don't want a pet that has an average life expectancy of less than 10 years. The longer the better, I'm tired of death. 

I can't have a pet that has a likelihood of frequent and severe life and death health issues. (I had house bunnies for most of my life and they are hands down my favorite pet, but constantly worrying about how much they were eating, if they were pooping enough etc wrought havoc on my own health.)

I want something that has the ability to give and/ or accept affection in some way.

Cuddling/ petting preferred.

I'm specifically not a cat person. (Just my luck right.)",2023-11-06 08:06:51

Not allowed to keep pets.,"Hi, I love animals. I've had dogs, cat, birds, turtle as pets while growing up. Mostly dogs. But currently I live with my Mom and elder sister, and I truly want a pet but they aren't allowing. They think it's a huge responsibility (which is true I know) and that if there's pet then we will be restricted from going out because we will have to think about the pet. I understand their perspective but I really want to have a pet. I asked if we could get any pet, if not dogs, but doesn't matter what I suggest they end up saying no to everything. How do I convince them? I really want a pet.😭😭😭

edit: Okay, so I see a lot of assumptions in the comments below and I can't sit and reply each one individually hence this edit. I think I should've been more clear about how old am I, what I do and also which part of world I am from. Some of you have asked that politely but some are straight away rude in their assumptions. I'm 31F, I am an artist, I paint and I have a home stidio, so that's why I mentioned in one of the comments that I'm mostly home. After my father passing away in 2020, I'm responsible for financial aid to my family and I take up that responsibility happily as we share close relationship and not distant. I'm South Asian and culture here is way different than in the west or other parts of world. We do live with our parents even if we're fully capable of living on our own. The house that we live rn isn't some rented house. It's our family home. I am allowed to call this home as ""my home"" emotionally and legally as I am heir too. So even if I get married I can still call this house as my home. Ask any South Asian what I mean, and you'll know. I also share quite healthy relationship with my Mom and Sister, as I mentioned somewhere down the comments. It's just that I took after my Dad's nature and happens to love animals more than my Mom or Sister does. My mom is somewhat inclined but my sister isn't really fond of animals in general. So I was just asking for some suggestions and some of you did suggest some great ideas and I'm thankful to them. But unfortunately few aren't polite. So I'd appreciate if you just drop your suggestions without being rude, cuz there's really no need to be, I'm not here to fight or somethin. I hope I'm clear enough now atleast.

Will my cat die in the back of my car? Serious answers only,"Ive got my landlord coming tomorrow and i havent said anything about my cat yet. All my family left me and my friendships are pretty non existent so my dad has told me i could put my cat in my car across the road. Can i make this work? Its a sedan. Otherwise idk what to do she is attached to me meaning she never leaves me alone for a second. I do however feel like its illegal and extremely dangerous to put any living animal inside a vehicle just based on advertisements. But ive seen dogs left in cars and stuff idk

Update so no one is worried!! The temp in Aus is too hot right today and i decided to keep my cat enclosed in the backyard. The landlord sent a carpenter and didnt come so it was a lot easier. Thankyou so much to everyone who commented, ill be using your ideas for the next time. Cheers to all of you

For people upset i have a cat where i might not be able to have one. I was told off the bat i could have one, i just didnt list her on my application because i had been homeless and didnt want to deter my application in the huge rental crisis going on right now. Im nineteen and on my own in an expensive rental i was doing my best. My cat will be listed soon. Also fyi i dont really give a shit either, my cat who is a child to me will have a home if i have a home even if the ""landlord doesnt want it"" they can suck my cock, also illegal now in victoria for landlords to say no. The cat has never damaged my house unlike the last one that had lived here. The landlords dont care about the house as theyre inherited units they dont even know anything about the place. Would also like to add in the slum lords in my country who would put you in mould and horrible houses without repair and not give a shit, im lucky to have a good real estate but it could be terrible. 

This sounds like defense and it is but i want you to know how it feels to be homeless in a rental crisis in australia right now and for the past few years. The house smelled like cat the moment i entered for inspection so i knew. ",2023-11-05 20:30:25
My mum was asked to take care of her friend’s cats but they’ve been with her for seven months and they are refusing to take them back. What do we do?,"My mum has been looking after her friends cats for around sevens months, her friend originally only said that she’d have them for 2 months and that was at the beginning of April and it’s now November. She didn’t mind looking after them at first because she thought  it would only be a short time and she appreciated a little bit of company. She loves the cats but she wants to move on with her life and be able to do what she wants to do, the problem is the friend doesn’t want to collect the cats and she’s getting more and more fed up and frustrated with them for it. She wants her home back to how it was before she had them as the cats are really destructive. When she expressed her annoyance to her friend they either brush it off or tell her “I don’t have time for them anymore” but still expects her to keep them for them. There’s always an excuse like “I’m away abroad” or “I’m working up XYZ” and she feels really taken advantage of and trapped in her own home as she can’t leave the cats by themselves for a long period of time as they are a special breed that requires a lot of maintenance. She feels like her friend is lying about not having time for them as they still have time to send food and litter for them via delivery and sure as hell can afford to keep them but refuses to pay her a fee for keeping them for them. What my mother would like to know is if there is a law which legally makes my mother the owner of these cats since the friend doesn’t want to collect them and she’s had them for this extended period of time? What can we do? How do we tackle this problem? Please help us with any advice

Edit : we are from the Uk 🇬🇧 

Edit 2 : a lot of people have said to drop the cats off at her friends house to force them to take them back. However the problem is the cats owner is very secretive about their whereabouts and won’t tell my mother where they live. The only time my mother has ever been to one of their previous homes is when she’d do cleaning for them and since them moving they won’t tell her where they live. They constantly lie about where they are and what they are doing. So unfortunately it’s not an option to drop them off. 

As for those who are saying to give them a deadline and give them to an animal shelter/contact the RSPCA I agree with that 100% and she wants to either sell them or send them to a shelter but she’s worried about getting in trouble because she’s unsure if these cats in a legal standpoint are her property and if it falls under the animal abatement laws. She’s also worried because this friend is also an alcoholic and they switch from “I don’t want the cats anymore” to “I’m going to pick them up on XYZ” and then they make up an excuse and it starts over again. So she’s unsure if they do actually want the cats or if they don’t. And since they do send the food for them and cat litter she doesn’t know if that stops the cats from legally being her property via abandoning laws. 

Pretty much my mother is at her wits end with her friend and the cats despite loving the kitty’s very much. ",2023-11-05 19:31:43
"My Dad is Physically Disciplining their Dog, Is this Bad?","Hey,

So I'm not a dog person (I have Cats) so I know very little on the subject. My Fathers Dog poops and urinates inside on occasion, usually when they don't take him outside much that day. I know the smart solution would be for them to take the dog for more outside time.

&#x200B;

When the dog has pooped inside, my father will hit the dog on the side of the back leg making it yelp, grab the dog by the back of the neck and put it's nose in the poo, this sounds bad on the surface but I wanted to know if this is standard practice or an issue before I tell my dad to pull his head in.

&#x200B;

As a side note, the dog isn't showing any signs of fear at this stage but I have read this can come later

&#x200B;

Thanks for any info you can provide

Edit: thanks all for the input, I'm going to show him the thread, give him resources and all that. If nothing improves I'll cross that bridge when I get to it, but I'll likely be making a call to rspca ",2023-11-05 16:49:31
What are the weird ways cats have come into your lives?,"Like cats just seem to magic themselves into existence lol. 

I once obtained a kitten while doing a family photo session. Went out to the client's beautiful property--old barn, whimsical greenhouse, so cute. It was a photographer's dream, honestly. And they had friendly little barn kitties; one in particular had caught my attention. My clients were like....so can we pay you in kittens? And I was like....yes? 

They still paid me actual money lol...plus cat tax 😆 I drove all the way home with a mewling little gray floof stuck to my shoulder. 

Anyways, my daughter took that cat with her when she moved out on her own, since they're besties and all. I just still love to tell that story. And since I had my camera handy when I brought the kitty home, I was able to capture my kids' initial reactions beautifully. My daughter (13 or 14 at the time) was so happy she legit ugly cried. They love those photos. 

You guys got any good ones?",2023-11-05 06:12:58
What’s the craziest thing your pet has gotten into or destroyed?,"When our puppies were maybe 6 months old, I heard them making noise in the other room. I went to investigate and found gray dust all over the living room and couch. I finally figured out it was our dog Rocky’s cremains. They were in a small wooden box on top of our piano, and the puppies had somehow gotten an end off, ripped open the bag, and scattered it everywhere. I still don’t know how they reached it.",2023-11-05 04:09:17
How do you feel about being covered in pet fur?,Am i the only one that doesn’t even mind if when I’m staying at home my clothes are covered in my cats fur?

My dog is messing me up,"I have a 12 yo. Bichon who I love to the end of the earth, but she is ruining me due to lack of sleep.  In her first 7 years of her life, she'd sleep in her crate on the main level.  Then we went away for 2 weeks and whoever she stayed with probably let her sleep in her bed, so upon returning she would bark at night until it became too much. Tired and exhausted we brought her up to our room and let her sleep with us.  She loved it and all was well.  She slept with us for years

Last year she had TPLO surgery and to avoid any injuries we dont allow her on our bed so she may jump off and hurt herself (injury had nothing to do with the bed).  So we put her crate in our room near the bed and she got used to sleeping in it at night nearby.  Now (for the last few weeks), more than a year later, she wakes up at all odd hours of the night and whines (not bark), to be let out. She tries for a bit, quits, and then tries again. Its exhausting. One weekend I really wanted to sleep in so I took her out and put her in the bed and she slept quietly for hours LOL. 

Note, she doesn't need to pee of poop at night.  On weekdays I'm up at 5:45 and she will get out of her crate all excited as if we are going on a picnic, and then when she sees me going down to exercise, she'll plomp right next to me and go to sleep.

What can I do here?? Help!!  ",2023-11-04 03:28:08
My dog suddenly hates my mom,"We adopted a dog when he was 2yrs old, and had been previously abused in his old home. This, of course, has had its issues with us - his family - as well as him having some brain damage. His favorite person was always my mom, and everyone fell into second place (exception being my boyfriend). My dog is only really particularly scared of men, as he was abused by a man. This morning my mom came to check on him as he was asleep in my bed, and he started snarling at her aggressively and came closer to me for comfort. This behavior is way out of left field for him as he was my mom’s buddy since we got him. I just wanted some advice on what this might be or what we could try. We think part of it is brain damage/PTSD, but we don’t *really* know. Any advice helps 🫶

Edit: He is currently 2/3 years old. The type of abuse he endured was choking/being thrown at stuff. We have brought him to the very who diagnosed partial seizures. We are looking into behavioral classes but they are incredibly expensive, along with a surgery he needs to get as he dislocated his knee jumping off the couch, and those will run us up at least $5000. We are making efforts to get him the resources he needs and are doing as much as we can right now to help. Like I said, we believe it is part of his PTSD as he was abused for close to his whole life before we adopted him (he was literally in the Witness Protection Program for dogs). I hope this clears some stuff up since I'm getting repetitive questions that I forgot to put in the original post.",2023-11-03 19:43:18
Good pets to have when I have cats?,"I want another pet. I can’t get a dog because they are too expensive but I was thinking about getting 2 guinea pigs or a hamster. The only issue is my dad is very against that idea because I already have 2 cats. He thinks that my cats will terrorise the Guineas/hamster and it’s a stupid idea. I explained to him that I will always separate them and I will do all the precautions to keep them safe. I absolutely adore animals so I won’t have any trouble doing that. He just won’t agree.

I am really keen on getting another animal though, even if it’s not a Guinea pig as such. Do you have any recommendations of what I can do?",2023-11-03 18:41:02
I posted last week that my dog and other dogs were abused by a trainer. I just wanted to post a quick positive update and more information!,"I updated my original post but I don’t think anyone really saw that so I thought I’d update here in another post. 

First and foremost, WE TOOK HER BUSINESS DOWN. 

So I found out last week about the abuse, I began to raise hell as soon as I found out.  When my friend who told me about the abuse dealt with her dog being poisoned with prescription human medication that is used to treat a condition the trainer was actively being treated with, she began to speak to past employees. They wrote formal written statements, one even being over 20 pages long. They detailed the abuse, naming specific employee, personal, and client dogs that were being abused. 

Us digging around along with some issues with the trainer not paying employees then buying another puppy with business money, all but one of the remaining employees quit over the weekend. Then we got those employees to make statements too. 


Some things the trainer did to these dogs:

**Sensitive Content**

-She would closed fist punch them in the face. She would also kick them “to knock the wind out of them as a correction.” She would hit them in the face with an open hand as well. She would also scream at them “I’m gonna fuck you up!” “Shut the fuck up!” “Fucking listen to me!” And other expletives. 
-She wouldn’t allow dogs to have water for an entire day. Sometimes up to 12 hours. She didn’t want them to pee in the building and didn’t want to take them outside. The only dogs that got water were the ones who were packed a lunch by their owners. Staff would try to sneak dogs water and if they got caught by the trainer she would flip out. 
-She would only allow staff to take dogs out maybe 1 time in an entire day. But she would tell clients they went out “every hour on the hour”
-She would lock dogs in an office and the bathroom or crates for hours on end with no food water or potty breaks. 


The worst of things is her abusive “put out” methods. 

-The “Helicopter” put out: She would grab their leash attached to a prong collar and spin in circles until they were lifted off of the ground. She would spin until they were about to lose consciousness and let go of the leash mid air causing them to tumble. 
-The hanging put out: She would toss the prong collar attached leash over a tall fence inside the facility and pull it until the dog was hanging. She would do this again, until they were about to pass out, then let go. 

She said that these methods “reset their brains” and that’s how she justified it. 

Okay so we got 5+ written statements and a few recorded phone calls with past employees and her business partner all saying the exact same things and mentioning the same dogs. She helicoptered senior dogs and neurologically challenged dogs. 

She also had two of her personal dogs euthanized this year because she didn’t want to deal with the reactivity caused by her own abuse on them. 

We got some other evidence too and began spreading the word. We kept leaving her bad reviews detailing the issues and she kept taking them down. So we jumped on a Facebook post in the local group asking about her facility and shamed her for all of her clients to see.  Her lawyer even backed out and dropped her as a client after we talked to him. 

After her employees quitting and the news starting to spread, she ultimately closed her business last night. What a relief that was.  

We still have some things in the works but we’ve made so much progress this week! We are so close to shutting her down for good and protecting so many innocent dogs from this monster.  

Thank you everyone who commented on my last post. It was so nice to have so much support.  We aren’t gonna stop until she’s behind bars. We want her to be done hurting dogs for good.",2023-11-03 04:22:30
moving out and taking my “family pet” with me - will he hate me?,"i have a 1.5 year old frenchie who my parents absolutely adore. though i bought him with my own money and im the primary caretaker, my parents have grown to love him and he also loves them. now it seems he’s more of a family pet.

i’m moving out in 3 weeks and i’m scared he’ll hate me for taking him away from the rest of my family. anyone experience moving out with the family pet?

EDIT: since everyone is asking, i am the primary caretaker - not only do i buy all his necessities but i also feed him, take him on walks everyday, groom him, cuddle with him, etc. my parents just love hanging out with him but when it comes to actually taking care of him, it’s on me. i’m also completely WFH and only really go out once or twice to see friends (usually i end up bringing him with me). hope this clarifies some things!

Loss of a pet,"So my fur baby died last night.

I have buried him in my garden under some flowers.

This morning I found out that three members of his and his (surviving) brothers litter were available and I have adopted them and brought them back to live together with my little guy, thankfully they have taken to one another immediately without issue.

I know that this is no way makes up for my little guys loss, but I genuinely feel I have done the right thing and am certain that my boys will have a fantastic life with me.

I know in my head there was nothing I could have done to save my little gerbil but I am still going through how could I have done more for him?

I feel in some way that by taking on his remaining brothers I am doing right by him.

I suppose my question for you all is does this guilt ever pass or evolve?

Thank you for your time.",2023-11-02 04:47:23
Surrender ?,"I have a yorkie that i have had since i was in 6th grade(21 now). My wife has a lab & pit mixed that she’s had for about a year now. Her last owners surrendered her because she killed a chicken. We just brushed it off to her playing too rough & her not realizing she was trying to play with something so small because she’s never showed signs of trying to hurt my yorkie until yesterday. My dog was just walking and the lab full on ran up on her like she wanted to take her by the neck but didn’t. So i told my wife to not have them around each other because this was odd. Last night we were in the kitchen cooking and we had gave the dogs peanut butter to have as a treat. The lab was in the living room while my yorkie was at my feet in the kitchen. 30 minutes go by and the lab comes in the kitchen and my yorkie takes her treat of peanut in the living room. As we are watching her and laughing about how she’s so tiny to be carrying something the lab full on attacks her from the back, like pinned her on the ground. We break them up and my dog is wailing like she’s in pain so i sit on the couch with her in my lap and she is shaking next thing i know she basically looked like she was having a seizure? She was laying there swaying back and forth really bad and wouldn’t move her whole left side. We rushed her to the emergency vet & they said it was just because she was so shooken up but she only had 2 little cuts from the attack. I have no clue what to do besides surrender the lab due to training being so expensive .. this was just unacceptable to me. May I add we took her to the vet a few weeks ago and they had to muzzle her because she tried to bite them.. same thing happened at her evaluation for daycare",2023-11-01 21:46:03
What was the moment you realized that animals are thoughtful/smart beings?,"Of course, growing up, most people are told that animals aren’t toys and need to be treated with care and respect. That’s not what I’m talking about. 

There was a time when I first got my own cat where I realized that he was more than just a breathing existing being, and that he did really have a personality and he did really enjoy things and thought things about the world. This moment is typically where people realize that animals can definitely be a humans best friend and you can form a genuine bond with your animals.

What is your story about how you came to understand your pets thoughts and personality, and how did you realize that you have a true best friend (or maybe not so much a friend) living with you?",2023-11-01 04:01:54
Do dogs In pet stores legally have to be let outside,"In my local mall they just opened a dog store. Pretty sure it’s a puppy mill and all the puppies are left in these little glass boxes and it looks like their is a place in the back, but it looked like more cages. I couldn’t find anything on google so I decided to come here. Do pet stores like pet smart and places that sell dogs, have to let them outside to like feel sunlight or whatever, or if those dogs are never bought, are they never going to be able to go outside.

There's dogs in the wider family, she seems happy with them being around but doesn't pay them much attention. We want her to be part of the decision and if she has a reason for not wanting a dog then we'll respect that.

I've educated myself in depth about such pets recently, and realized that the fact they're nocturnal/crepuscular gives his statement some merit.  Also they tend to be sensitive to noise as a survival tactic. Although if they're on the exercise wheel that could drown out the sound.

Chewy was amazing after rabbit's death,My rabbit just died last Monday suddenly and his order of food from chewy was delivered right after that.

They gave me a refund and told me to keep the box of food and donate it. I was overjoyed. They then also sent me a bouquet of flowers which was so sweet with a hand written card.

My family is angry that I have cats,"To start. I am in my own home, late 20s, have children, have a stable job, pay my own expenses and have pet insurance and proper vet care for my pets. I grew up with cats, dogs, rabbits, hamsters, horses, etc.... You name it, I probably owned it. I absolutely love animals.

I had a dog but she recently passed away. My first cat was in love with our dog and her passing had seemed to take a toll on him so we decided to adopt a second cat and they have been getting along wonderfully. I occasionally petsit my best friends cat, as well, when she goes on vacation, so sometimes I have 3 cats in the house. 

I recently told my family that I adopted a second cat and I have gotten so many lectures by family outside of my household. We've gotten stuff like the cats are going to make my children sick, my home will smell, family won't visit if I have cats, and the worst ""you're just replacing your dog."" 

I take all preventative measures to keep the home clean. Daily cat pan scooping, regular litter box changes, the cats get professionally groomed on a regular basis and they have all their vaccines and monthly preventative. Does anybody deal with family who complain about your pets even though you are a grown adult who is moved out of the house? I honestly don't think two cats is a big deal to complain about.",2023-10-28 22:01:59
Has anyone gotten a pet and found out it wasn’t for them?,"I honestly just feel guilty. I got Guinea pigs, nice cage, decent toys, Al the works.

I currently have a 40 gallon fish tank that is miminal effort since it’s been cycled , a corn snake who his 4 years old and very simple. The Guinea pigs are a lot, more than a dog or even a cat. I honestly wish we got a dog. 

Idk I just am having regrets and feeing guilty that I adopted these animals and they just aren’t giving me the feelings of care. Lots of cleaning, food prep, and they still aren’t comfortable yet (been 3 weeks maybe). I just don’t know if I’ll ever be able to bond the way I wanted too with them.

Vet Tech mistake,"This is all very fresh and I still don’t know how to process it. I took my cat in for a neuter a few days ago with a vet that I know and trust. While the operation went well, one of the vet techs was tipping a group of strays and tipped my cat’s ear by mistake. The vet called me immediately and informed me of the mistake. She was extremely upset/apologetic and offered to try and round the ear out to make it less noticable. I gave her permission and waited anxiously for her next call. She did a great job at trying to match his now 1/3 shorter ear to the other but obviously now my cat is missing a large portion of his ear. Not to mention he got an additional surgical procedure (the tipping) that he never would have needed. I’m livid, confused, devastated… and the icing on the cake was when I went in, the first thing they did was try to charge me. The vet that did his neuter waved the neuter cost (she had told me that on the phone) but I was being told I needed to pay for everything else including staff support care. Not a single apology when I got there, no sympathy, just concern for me paying the rest of the bill. I didn’t make a scene in front of the other clients and I treated the staff with respect even with how devastated I was and how cold they were being. I just paid the bill and left with my cat because I wanted him home as soon as possible. I’ve raised this cat from 3 weeks old, bottle fed him and he is so important to me. Is there anything I can do? I don’t want to get the veterinarian in trouble as she’s amazing and it really seems like it wasn’t her fault.. but I’m so upset. Does anyone have any advice or thoughts about where I should go from here?

"Genuine question, why do vets push Royal Canin or science diet so hard?","Had two different vets with our cats and dog. They always seem to give a sales schpiel about how amazingly formulated these brands are.

But then I look at the ingredients and all I see is garbage? Like dog food first ingredient is chicken meal then it's rice and wheat and corn and oils. Similar with cat foods. Our one cat had digestive problems and we fed them a gastro for a bit, but eventually switched it out once things settled. They're on orijen Prairie red now and their fur is so much better and they just feel and seem healthier and happier over all.

I feed my pets what I'd want to eat. Reading the ingredients from these brands makes me not want to eat it. It just seems like it's all cheap fillers and crap with very little meat protein.",2023-10-27 19:49:13
I found out yesterday that my dog was severely abused at a day training facility earlier this year. I’m a mess.,"Don’t really know how to process this news. I knew that something was wrong, my dog was miserable every time I took him and spent every day scared of everything. If he did something wrong he’d hide in the corner and lay down with his head down but I’ve given him no reason to do this. He was afraid of everything, even if you just walked funny he would cower and hide. I stopped taking him as soon as I realized this was how he was acting. I was contracted to take him 3 days a week due to the adoption agreement she had with me because i adopted him from her after he was surrendered. 

Then yesterday comes and someone reaches out to me to let me know that it’s come to light that my dog and many others were beaten and abused by this trainer. I won’t go into too much detail in case the trainer somehow sees this but it’s bad. Very bad. 

We’re working on a case against her but these things take time. We tried leaving one star reviews on her google page but she’s somehow getting them removed. It’s garbage because they’re legitimate reviews made by people whose dogs have been in her care or have worked with her. 

It just sucks. I really hope we can build a solid case against her and shut her down. The stuff she has done is unimaginable. Dogs have died and been near death. I’m going to be taking my dog to the vet for an extra exam and x-rays to see if there are any healed injuries from this abuse. Others are doing this as well. 

Thanks for reading, I’m just a mess and needed to put it out into the universe to help me process this a bit. It’s been a wave of emotions and I’m so overwhelmed.


Edit: I’ve been trying to reply to everyone but it’s been hard to keep up. Wanted to add a few things. 

First, thank you those who understand that I’m not sharing more details because of a pending case against her. When I’m able to, I’ll happily share everything. I don’t want to do anything to harm our case because this person needs to see justice. 

Second, I wanted to make sure that you all know that my dog and a few other dogs that we are in contact with who have been harmed by her, are doing much better. Stopping contact with her was great for everyone involved. Our dogs are on the road to healing and are much happier without her. These things take time but I’m happy to report that it’s going well so far. 

Third, we are definitely reporting to every relevant authority possible. And will be sharing these things with many media outlets as well. We want to spread the word. We have a lot of plans on how we are going to spread the news and I can’t wait for that to start to happen. We hope to begin this phase in the coming days. 

Thank you all so much for your care and support. It’s been a hard, emotional week. This is far from over and we’re here for the long haul even if it’s difficult for us to learn these things and deal with the aftermath of our spreading the news. It’s been draining because of all of the emotions we feel but we have to fight for our babies and other people’s fur babies too. 



** EDIT 2: **

Why does my dog not like certain people?,"My dog Bean, is a chihuahua and min pin mix. She's currently 2 1/2 years old. Bean is a very friendly dog, and like most chihuahuas is very attention seeking. When we have people over she's all over them for the first couple minutes wanted to get attention but after that she usually calms down. Will lay down next the them or me and occasionally cries/barks for pets or cuddles. Or she'll grab a toy and kids force it into your hand to play.

She's actually a very well behaved dog and usually listens to my 'no' when I can tell she's being too much for the guests. When a stranger comes over she's definetly more apprehensive. Barks a lot, does her nervous teeth chattering but she's never tired to bite or snap at them. After she sniffs and get used to them she'll do what she usually does as I explained above. She'll want to be all over them. 

However there's been a few people that she just can't seem to be around. They've been over a few times now to where at this point she'd usually already be used to them. However she seem to be worse with them. Even snapped and tries to bite a few times. It's gotten to the point where I have to cage her/separate her from them when they do come over. 

I'm pretty baffled by her behavior as, like I said above, she's quite well behaved and very friendly after the initial meeting. At first I thought maybe it was because she was 'gaurding' me/her dad/or maybe just the space in general. As sometimes when familiar but not very familiar guests make sudden movements around or towards me she freaks out. But it's never been more than her annoyingly long barking.

But with these few people she trys to get aggressive and I don't understand why. They've never done anything to provoke her that I've seen. Any suggestions would be appreciated but I really would just like to know why she behaves like this with certain individuals.",2023-10-27 01:30:10
A dog person learning to be a cat person,"When me and my wife were dating her cats were not sure what to do with me. Me being used to dogs knew that when you walk by a dog they expect you to pet them, even if it is just for a second. Now here I am walking by this cat and petting her each time, which I learned very quickly she didn't like that. She began swatting at me. My wife said that she was testing me. So I began swatting back, very lightly mind you. Eventually the cat would raise her paw. I would then raise my hand. She then put down her paw and stopped swatting at me. She now comes up to me for pets when she wants. It looks like I've been adopted into the family. ",2023-10-26 14:50:36
My family members are horrible pet owners,"Has anyone been put in a situation that they know that they can’t take care of a dog but the family doesn’t do anything for their dog and just treat it like it’s a toy?

My older siblings also have teens who don’t want to put a good amount of time for the dog so I feel like I’m the one who has to take charge even though the breed isn’t meant for first time owners. 
I blame one of my older siblings for not being considerate of the breeds needs and only got the dog “just because”. He deserves a loving family that can cater to his needs. However, I can’t even do anything like find him a new home because he isn’t mine. I’m just so upset and frustrated.",2023-10-25 19:46:27

So since they didn’t  give her a bath and she is a long haired dog she has piss and shit caked on her collar and since she was getting rabies vaccines she had the runs so I took her to get washed at the vets office becuase I was not gonna do it you are not supposed to wash them after surgery then I took her to get a trim around privates which you still not supposed to do but my vet recommended it becuase she had a high chance of infection and the last thing was that she was seven months old and had a weight of 45 pounds fuck that place I’m glad i got her",2023-10-25 11:18:14
Kittens missing one by one. Did they die?,"Back story: we domesticated a stray cat about a year ago. Last month (October 2) she gave birth to her litter in our yard and hid them behind some shrubs and discarded wood panels. 

We placed an open crate with lots of blankets right next to our front door to give her an option to move her kittens since rainy season is starting. (we're not in the US, btw) 

About two weeks ago, she moved all her three kittens into the box. A week ago, the smallest one disappeared after we left our house for a day out. Nowhere to be found, not even any little kitten remains. 

Tonight, the fattest one (and in my opinion, the absolute cutest) also suddenly disappeared. We left the house right before sundown and got back late into the night to find just one kitten left in the crate. The mother cat was with her. 

Mom cat has always been affectionate towards her kittens and has adjusted well to our family. She even enters our house at her whim. 

The kittens did not appear sick or frail. We live in the city, so there aren't any predators here to speak of. Again, not in the US (living in the Philippines) so things like foxes and crows or whatever might pop into your head do not exist here.

If there's anything I noticed it's that since after the cat giving birth, there have been a minimum of three male cats frequenting our garage. I often find them curled up in the middle of the area with eyes locked on the little crate. I assume they're hoping to mate.

What are the odds that the kittens just walked far enough to get lost? Or am I hoping for the unlikely?",2023-10-24 22:45:22
Will this plan help me hide another cat from the wife?,"Long story short, I've always been a cat lover. Before I was married, I actually had a leash trained buddy that would come with me on road trips. Have averaged 5-6 kitties at a time my entire life. Have done lots of foster and special needs adoptions too. 

Well, I met my wife and she was mildly allergic and not generally a fan of them. When we got married, we agreed to keeping the ones I already had. Just not allowed in the bedroom. 

Well, last year I was really sad after an older kitty passed, and I took a chance. One of my kitties is pure white and deaf... so I adopted another deaf white kitty. And my wife hasn't noticed yet. She just assumes it was the original one when she happens to see it. 

We now have 5 total (4 in her mind). Well, we have a lot of square footage, and I really would like to rescue one more. 

Do you think I'm taking too big of risk if I adopt another identical white kitty without saying anything? How many people really would notice, assuming they aren't cat people?",2023-10-24 15:38:59

My 1 year old dog is in end-stage kidney failure. Please help me make sense of this.,"Hi everyone,

On Tuesday, I took my 1 year old baby to the ER because he was vomiting, which wasn’t extremely unusual because he’s always been an extremely picky eater. I took him to the vet because of it countless times in the past, and after rounds and rounds of normal test results, the advice I’d always get is that he was just picky. 

Today, we’re at a specialized university hospital with his creatinine levels at 5 and significant proteinuria showing very little improvement. He’s been hospitalized for 6 days on IV fluids at this point. 

The internal medicine specialist recommended against a biopsy due to his numbers, as they put him on end-stage kidney failure, and recommended we start immunosuppressive medication to try to give him one last shot. 

I am devastated, lost, and so angry. He is only 1. He’s a baby. I have read every single post there is about kidney failure and it’s mostly older dogs, or at least doggies that are >4. Throughout this whole process, he doesn’t even look sick. He’s lost appetite which again, has always been very normal for him. Other than that, he’s excited to go on walks when I visit him, always ends up eating when I’m there, drinks water, and is generally alert and playful. How is this what end-stage looks like? 

I’ve always been on top of absolutely everything with him. Never missing a vet appointment, never once declining a single test/treatment the vet recommended. I am shocked at this diagnosis. 

I see him, and his 4 little paws are shaven and poked all over from tests and medication. He has never been away from me for this long, and I work from home so we spend 24/7 together. It’s just heartbreaking to think about how confused he must be while his body shuts down on him. I have cried in absolute pain in ways I didn’t think possible.

Seeing him look so good despite what’s going on inside me make it so hard for me to lose hope and know it’s time. 

Please, if you have been through this, I want to know your experience. If you can say anything at all that can help me make sense of this, I would be eternally grateful. It helps immensely to know someone relates to this sort of pain. Thank you so much for reading. <3

Edit: My sweet baby has left us. In agreement with the vet, we made the decision to let him go before he was too weak. Something that was very important to us since the beginning is that we would never put our suffering before his. We spent the afternoon together, took a walk and sat on a bench for the longest time while he ate lots of his favorite treats. I feel like I died with him. If any desperate pet parent in the same situation I was sees this in the future, I just want you to know I am so sorry. Please, please, give your baby the opportunity to spend its last few moments in peace and dignity while you still can, not in pain and great suffering. Thank you everyone for your kind words.

"Could a cat be a support animal? If yes, how?","
I absolutely adore my two-year-old cat. I've had her since she was a kitten, and she truly means the world to me. Just to give you some context, I'm currently working part-time to cover a few personal expenses because I'm a full-time nursing student, and I'm living in my dad's rented apartment.

After having my cat living unnoticed in the apartment for an entire year, the landlord discovered that we have a cat. Since I'm not contributing to the household expenses and can't move out, I didn't want to put my dad in an uncomfortable situation. So, the bottom line is that my cat is currently being well cared for by a friend who lives four hours away.

However, I read the contract and realized that support animals are allowed. Can a cat be considered a support animal, and how can I prove that she is one?",2023-10-23 13:27:26
Cat cage,"My mom bought a cat cage today because she had enough of our cat.. The first thing they do is scratching the newly bought sofa which caused it to look ugly. We could get an anti scratch sofa by adding few hundred but she said it's too expensive. Few weeks after the sofa my cat have scratched it a lot. I have suggested to buy scratch post for the cat but she keeps forgetting. We have recently moved into new place and my mom have been letting our cat roam free anywhere untill one morning she saw 2 of my cat poop in our neighborhood house (their front house floor) She got extremely angry and was scared that our new neighbors would complain cause she can't handle complain and would be super stressed so she bought a huge cat's cage in that day and putted them in. I feel bad for the cats but I can't really fight against my mom.. Any suggestions what's a better decision in this?
The neighbor's also told my mom that if a person complain, an authority would take our cat and end it's life if we don't take it back which also caused her to get scared.

Tldr: cat scratch newly bought sofa and dining chair mom still okay just a lil bit mad and still let they roam. Cat poop in neighborhood front yard - mom got crazy mad and scared that the neighborhood would complain so she bought a cat cage and putted them in.",2023-10-22 20:27:54
Idiot reached for my dog even though I was pulling him away.,"I walk my dog at nights because he's not fully socialized but had never been aggressive towards anyone except other dogs.

He immediately said he bit me he should be put down. My dog got his coat and all this guy was saying is are you going to make it right. I told him my address and told him to get his lawyer to drop me a line. Finished the walk and he was waiting for me at my house trying to get money for his $400 coat. I repeated what I said earlier and he kept trying to push it and he wouldn't relent and I told him I'm done and going in do what you gotta do. I suspect he'll call animal control or something but I know enough law that I'm not too worried. You hear about people like this but you never think you'll meet them.

I don't want this, I've told him of the risks, the time and money but he thinks its worth it and doesn't see them being related as a major problem at all

HELP!!! Roomate doesn't take care of his dog,"He got a puppy back in July. 3 month old GSD/Belgian Mal I think. And he hasn't really done anything with it since he got it. 

When he first got the dog he would take him out and play with him multiple times per day. Now I think he gets let out of his cage 1-2 times per day. Sometimes not. I know for sure that on the weekends he sometimes doesn't let the dog out at all. There's a sheet on top of his cage. 

It's been like this for months. My house smells like poop and pee. I know that dog is laying in his own waste. Yesterday I come home from work while roomate is at work and the dog broke out of his cage. He's covered in waste. His cage is disgusting. Out of courtisy and mercy I spent a few hours with him and cleaned out his cage and gave him water and we spent a lot of time outside to hopefully air his fur out. He's so gross. And I gave roomate a big earful. 

I don't hate the dog and I feel terribly for him but I didn't even want roomate to get a dog in the first place. Especially not a massive puppy.

And just yesterday I saw him poop in his cage and start eating it.... 

Thing is that roomate ""loves"" the dog and I'm very afraid that if I make arrangements to take it to a shelter roomate might not be financially cooperative with paying bills and such. 

Feeling very stuck but I'm a huge animal lover and hate to watch this dog go through this. He's a good boy. He's just very young and very energetic. And definitely needs people. That person just isn't me. I have a cat already. Dog is just way too much for my mental right now. 

Please help. I'm afraid of I contact the authorities I won't be able to pay all these bills by myself



EDIT: I understand that I shouldn't be so concerned about bills when there's a dog suffering in my house.... I'm just very very broke and very very stressed.... Which doesn't really matter considering the hell dog is going through. 

I've seen your guys comments and I'm going to do the right thing and report. I really didn't know how bad the dog was doing until last month when I saw him. He always keeps a sheet over the cage ""because it keeps dog more comfortable"". So I never saw him really. I thought he let dog out while I was at work.

I hear you guys, thank you for making it clear how bad this is. Sorry for waiting. First thing tomorrow I'll make the call.",2023-10-20 20:02:16

Petsitter lost my cat and didn't tell me for weeks. Situation is driving me crazy.,"I posted on here about a month ago about how my father lost my cat and didn’t tell me for 3 weeks. The story has developed into something much worse than what I was initially told.

I left for a trip in July and was supposed to be back at the end of summer. I trusted my dad to take care of my cat while I was away. This isn’t the first time he’s been a petsitter for me as I left last summer for the same amount of time and there were no problems. He’s always liked the cat ever since I was a kid. The week before I come home I call to ask about the cat and he tells me she went missing 3 weeks ago. Obviously this was horrible news and a betrayal. But the situation got so much worse. Apparently the initial story he told me wasn’t even the half of it. She was missing for 6 weeks before I found out. I was able to track down the correct date of her disappearance according to the day he initially downloaded and printed “lost cat” posters. I am only finding this out now after piecing how much of his story about how she disappeared had so many confusing and conflicting details. For example, while I was away I would ask him about my cat and request photos of her because I missed her. But after taking a closer look at the photos he sent me while I was away, they weren’t even photographs taken this summer. I feel so stupid. I guess I just need to vent because the whole situation is driving me nuts and my family keeps blaming me saying that if I was going to be this upset then I shouldn't have left at all. And there’s just no one to talk to about this because any time I get upset or talk about this situation I’m told “she’s just a cat” and “she’s probably dead already”. It makes my search feel so useless. She’s been microchipped for years and I’ve put up signs everywhere and I’ve posted on every Facebook group and I go looking for her every night but still nothing. I’ve talked to like 30 different vets and shelters asking if they’ve seen her and leaving a photograph with them and still no sign of her. This is just so insane. I feel like I’ve been fucked over so badly and I don’t even understand why I’m being lied to other than the pure carelessness and cowardice of my father. I’ve had this cat since I was a young girl and the story of her disappearance makes me feel so guilty and sad and angry and is driving me crazy with how my family doesn’t care at all. I feel like a stranger to them. It’s like me being upset is just a nuisance.

Any support will be greatly appreciated. I feel so awful right now.",2023-10-20 08:28:01
What foods do your dogs go absolutely crazy for?,"My 12 year old poodle mix, with already a history of being a picky eater, has been refusing to eat most meals after the loss of the other dog in the home. It's been almost a month, so I took him to the vet and bloodwork, urinalysis, and abdominal x-ray are all fine.

He normally eats Open Farm pork with grains. I've also tried a gently cooked food, Primal freeze-dried raw, several different canned foods of varying textures from a pate to a stew.  The vet gave him Gerber chicken and gravy and he happily ate that, but he begrudgingly eats it mixed in with his kibble. He will gladly eat treats and chews, but obviously those won't sustain him.

The vet wants me to try different foods and try getting him engaged with friend's dogs, more walks etc. Over the next two weeks before considering putting him on medication like Prozac. I'm also considering short-term fostering as I'm not financially or emotionally prepared to adopt again. She recommended short-term because he would be less likely to get attached.

So, anyone have any foods that their dogs just go nuts over?",2023-10-19 04:36:24

My cat never went to trading to be a service animal but warns me?,"My cat who I got at a shelter between the ages of 8 weeks - 10 weeks old is now an adult (6 years old).

She has never been in service animal training before. 

Now some back story. I have a low heart rate 24/7 and my pulse is on the low end. I have fainting spells as well. 

Out of 5 animals cat is the only one who will warn me within 20 minutes before I faint or have heart issues. She also isn’t a cuddly girl and is antisocial so I know it’s not her just wanting attention.

I’m curious if this is common thing and also why my other animals don’t seem to sense it?",2023-10-16 06:29:58

Why is there a ridiculous price difference between vets,"I have always know my vet is cheap. I was not aware of how cheap until this week. My cat had a dental cleaning, blood work, xrays, prescription food, and medication all for under $500 and they gave me a $125 off. 

Well they sent me to a specialist at an emergency vet since they wanted a second opinion since my cat had tooth absorption and didn't want to remove any teeth not nessasary. The appointment with the specialist was this week. 

The specialist did ened up taking 5 more teeth at $2,500. Didn't think much of it since he was a specialist but I just looked at the bill and what the heck. The same prescription with the same mg and amount that cost me $30 at my vet was $109 at this one. The prescription food that once more was the same, at my vet that was $3.50 a can was $9.50 there. The initial vet vist was $150 while my vet was $25. 

That seems so drastic in price I'm just at a loss. I really wonder if I could have just had my vet at the very least prescribe the food and meds to save money but don't know why it was so much more expensive.",2023-10-15 08:59:16

I did and she led me to my bedroom.   She then went under the bed, came out, back under and out again.

I can't kneel down so i lifted the edge of the mattress.   He was there.

I never taught her to do this.  Yet she clearly understood me and effectively led me.",2023-10-15 03:30:17
Am I overreacting for comments made by my dog’s groomer?,"I take my dog to a groomer every so often, she leaves her spotless and I really like her work, but recently she made some remarks that left me really uncomfortable and it has already crossed my mind taking her to another groomer.
She basically said that my dog rolled into her belly really often, and sometimes that indicates animal abuse, leading to them being submissive.
Mind you, me and my family never laid hands on her and have had her since she was a baby, so we know her past and she has never suffered abuse, it’s just her nature.
Am I overreacting about what the groomer said or should I take this more seriously and start looking for another groomers?",2023-10-14 21:50:10
Did I overreact at the vet?,"I dropped my kitten off for a spay/neuter event at 7am. On their patient portal it said she'd have surgery at 7:30. Pickup time was 2-4 with a note that arriving later would result in a fee. I showed up around 2:15 (along with another person), and staff got irritated, said I wasn't supposed to just show up, should have waited for a call, and my cat hasn't had surgery yet but she'd be able to be picked up before 4 so I should come back.

At that point I clarified shed have surgery and be available to go home within an hour, and they said yes. I said that wasn't communicated, and id just take her home and go elsewhere (this was all I said, not even in a hostile tone). They got super offended and acted like I was an insane person. A tech stormed out from a back room and began berating me about how I misunderstood the pickup process. I didn't even explain my concerns about taking her home right after surgery late in the afternoon when id have to take her to a ER or something if there was a complication. I've never had a kitten spayed before (I've always adopted them spayed), so I was nervous. This lady followed me out berating me. Then someone called me on the way home to tell me again that I was wrong and misunderstood the pickup. It wasn't even about that really, but she wouldn't let me explain so I hung up.

Did I jump the gun? I still can't believe they got so upset. Ive gone to this place before and got along fine with everyone, but they acted like I dishonored them by asking to take her home. Again: I was not confrontational!!",2023-10-14 20:31:51
Neighbours cats keep killing the wildlife and I'm sick to death off it,My new neighbours moved in a few months ago and they have 3 cats.

The neighbour does not care what so ever which has really annoyed me. I have put up spikes on my fence which has been removed multiple times by the neighbour because apparently it has badly injured one of the cats. What about the wildlife that has been attacked and killed ? Anyway the spikes are not even sharp . This morning the cats attacked a nest in the tree which had baby birds in. They all died.

"Mom, Dad, and Babies were in plastic tote beside the road😡","I wish I could share an image of us bathing the cutest kittens you've ever seen in your life. But I just want to share this with you because it makes me so angry:

I work at an animal shelter. Today, someone brought in a feline family that had been in a plastic tote beside the road. They must have been there for a while too, because there were maggots and flies on them. We had some hot days recently too. It's bad enough when someone does not spay or neuter their pets and contributes to pet overpopulation (which ultimately means high euthanasia rates, though I personally work in a no-kill shelter).

It is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR SOMEONE TO ABANDON THEIR PETS, let alone the tiny kittens their pets created. I don't think anyone in this group would ever do that. I just humbly ask that you speak up whenever you suspect someone you know is not being a responsible pet owner. Innocent lives depend on us. Thank you 🙏",2023-10-13 05:21:51

I checked the cat over and he was okay.. I think, But his front paws was burned . I did was his paws with some cold water and took him round to his owner to explain what had happened.  She raised her voice at me and said it was all my fault and that I should pay so he can go to the vet to be checked? Currently I am refusing because it wasn't my fault and to he honest she would be replacing all the cups that broke. I didn't actually say that but maybe I should have done.

1. i don’t like picking up poop but i’m assuming my love for it would be bigger and i won’t care?! maybe?? lol. (is saying it mean??) 

2. i live alone so it would be alone all day until i get back from work

3. i’ve never had a dog or cat before! idk what to expect tbh. 

are dogs or cats better as pets? i love both but just curious on your thoughts! i’d really appreciate everyone’s input. 

i always see how ppl love their animals and how the pets love their owners and how funny they are and i guess i want that too :’) again, i’ve never had a pet so that’s why i resist. i feel like i won’t be a good pet owner. what if it’s not what i thought? what if i don’t want it anymore? all these questions… help!!

How do people deal with giving their pets medication they hate?,"I always feel TERRIBLE I know my cat needs it but he gags and salivates and I have to hold his head still and force him to take it (syringe). How do people deal with this? I've tried mixing it with something he likes like those tube treats, but it always takes the whole tube in order for him not to taste it, and sometimes he doesn't eat it if he isn't feeling well so the whole thing is ruined.
He's just had surgery and needs to be confined to a crate for a couple of weeks so he probably hates me for that too. just feel so bad the poor guy doesn't understand why his everyday spoiled life turned to this. He's not even three yet so he always wants to get out and run around, even when on his meds.
Anyways I figured I'd see if anyone had any advice because I feel so bad every time. Also will he hate me for this? Literally weeks of only taking him out of the crate to force him to take his meds or clean out his litterbox. He hates it :(",2023-10-12 12:40:39
"Those very bonded with their pet- are there circumstances where you'd prioritise your pet before partner, family etc?","I am trying to educate myself on culture and things I don't have experience of.

I saw some joke posters on etsy listing all the things a guest must endure because it is the ""cats home"" (spoken by the cat).

I have also sometimes read people on reddit complaining how their partner, family ""put their dog first"" and that they feel like they are playing second fiddle to the dog.

I don't have a pet and never had one, so I  am unfamiliar with this kind of relationship. I would assume that the person humans bond most is their partner (or children, if they are small) and I am finding it hard to believe that someone would bond more with an animal than a human, and prioritise them over their close human relationships.  


  
Edit: 

I personally understand the word ""soulmate"" to mean someone who is the closest person in the world. 

If you view your pet as your soulmate-how does this square with having a human soulmate? Can you also have one? Would your pet be the only one? Is your human partner not your soulmate, or are they? How do they cope with having a furry competitor?

I regret going out when my cat was sick,"I had a street cat coming to my place for feeding atleast flr two years now. He was really sweet and friendly, took him days to trust my family and start napping at our home. He used to nap at my bed all the time. He had his own routine at other neighbors too (they used to feed him too. Neighbors in my locality are quite animal friendly) 

On Friday he came to my place and drooling alot and was feeling anxious. I immediately took him to a vet (it's a rescue place suggested by neighbors when I showed them how the cat was drooling and not well). Doctor gave him an injection and said he was dehydrated. That's it. I probed him to know more, should I be monitoring him, what should I give him, is anything serious. 

I came back the cat was resting, still not well, still drooling. I thought he'll get better after resting and I went out in the evening. Though my parents were home, I knew they wouldn't take care of him much. At night when I came back, he was trying to sleep, still restless. I ensured that I'll take him to a different vet first thing in the morning, but he left in the early morning (we live with balconies) and later that day I came to know he died from my neighbors. 

I regret going out that evening. I should have stayed and taken him to a different vet. It's been 2 days and I can't focus on anything except if I stayed back and taken to different vet he would've been okay.

My dog doesn’t care what I do for a living or how much money I make. They don’t care about our pasts. They forgive when we make mistakes (unless of course said mistake is filling their food bowl 5 minutes late). And all they ask for in return is that we love them back and keep them safe.

Neighbors: (smiling) Don’t worry, she’s friendly! 

Me: (deadpanning) She isn’t.

Found a freezing kitten outside,"Earlier today at the store I work at someone found a freezing kitten in the parking lot. She brought the kitten in, and he was very cold and shivering, its been around +5 Celsius today, so it’s quite cold. I wrapped him up good and he warmed up, did a little bit of research online so I bought some corn syrup, eggs and canned evaporated milk from where I work. I left work for lunch with the kitten and mixed the evaporated milk, 1 egg yolk, and 2 tablespoons corn syrup, along with an equal amount of boiling water. He drank a little from a syringe but he doesn’t want anymore. I’m not sure how recently he was properly fed though. He was moving around a bit more and had some energy, but he’s having a nap right now, and is good and warm. It’s currently Saturday, and I won’t be able to go to the vet until Tuesday and get him the proper milk, as it’s thanksgiving weekend and most places are closed. Until then what should I do? I have 4 cats at home, but they are all fully grown now and I've never had one this young, I would say he’s only 1-2 weeks old. I’ll keep warming up the milk I made him, but what else do you recommend I do to help this kitten? I also should mention, the lady that brought him into the store thinks someone just abandoned the kitten there. Cause there’s no way that kitten could have wound up in the parking lot all by himself.

Do I have to give up my pet?,"Hi there, about 5 years ago, my exes brother couldnt look after his 2 cats and didnt want them anymore, basically about to abandon them. Even though i was very reluctant to get involved, especially because i lived on a main road, i eventually decided to take them rather than them be abandoned.

Now after 6ish years, 1 of the cats unfortunately died but the other is still alive and well loved and looked after by me and my parents. Now though my exe's brother is saying he wants his cat back, or i need to recompensate him to buy him a new kitten which is worth around £900. I dont know the exact laws on this seeing as he decided he didnt want them anymore but do i have to give him his cat back? I said i would be happy to recompensate him the value of the cat currently (around £2-300 for a ragdoll of 8 years old) but im not willing to pay him for a brand new kitten, even though i feel like i dont owe him anything because it was him that abandoned them in the first place.

What is the law here, do i have to give him back his cat, or compensate him at all? Been trying to find advice online but finding it difficult. Thanks!

Can’t afford kitten vaccines,"EDIT: I set an appointment at Petco for this weekend. Thank you for the help guys 


Can’t afford kitten vaccines

A few months ago, a cat came to our porch and we’ve been giving her food and water. We’ve never had pets before this, we were just taking care of the cat. The cat got used to us and would return every day for food and water. She had been coming to us for three months when we came home one day and she was giving birth on our front door. We didn’t want to just leave the kids outside because we didn’t want them to get hurt so we took them to a spare room in the back where we still keep the kittens. We give them food, water, a litter box, toys and I spend time with them every day. Recently, I found out that kittens need to be vaccinated after 6-8 weeks. Our kittens are 11 weeks. I panicked and started calling vets asking for information on vaccines for kittens, but the price is just not suitable for us at all. We aren’t necessarily poor, but we are not really wealthy either. We don’t live in the best neighborhood or in the best house and as much as we want to take care of the kids, I’m not sure we are able to. Are these vaccines absolutely necessary? We’ve seen stray kids before with presumably no vaccine, but they seem to be fine, but I also don’t want anyone to be hurt. Any advice would be helpful.",2023-10-06 01:26:50

Serious question: Can a cat be mentally ill? Like beyond depression/anxiety?,"Ok so my brother and I have four cats and a dog. All but one are pretty normal (though the dog is the independent one oddly enough). Three of them are sisters one of which is just... off. Phoenix is just weird to the point that we have come up with our own terminology for her behavior phases thay she goes through. One week she'll just hang out near the food all day, sometimes just moving the bowl around seemingly for the hell of it. Then, randomly,  she'll just change out of nowhere and start hanging out near one of us and dig in there for awhile. But then, most troubling is when she does what we call bricking. She'll start wanting to climb all over me (and rarely my brother)and want to just lay on our chests, close to our faces like a furry little brick (hence the name). Sometimes she'll do this for weeks then randomly start acting differently again. I'll get up, she'll jump off and wait for me to come back and climb right back on. The vet gave her prozac but I didn't like the effect it had one her, she had some pretty gnarly side effects. Plus, though she is as sweet and gentle as a cat can get, giving her a pill is downright dangerous. She's incredibly strong despite being the smallest one lol. There's other weird things about her as well (like her obsession with ice) but I don't wanna get into tl;dr territory.

"If you don’t have the time, energy or money, don’t get a pet","So many of you are shocked that you need to put effort in, or that your pet’s well-being is your responsibility. People are even here complaining that their pets smell. Give them a bath ffs. They’re animals, what did you expect?

Training takes work. Proper care takes time and costs money. You are responsible for the creatures in your care. If you can’t handle it, don’t get one.

Edit: apparently it wasn’t clear, but I’m not talking about a financial situation changing or anything along those lines. I’m talking about people who won’t have the capacity to own an animal an **get one anyway**, or people who don’t understand basic care and adopt an animal anyway. That’s my issue.

Please stop putting words in my mouth. I’m talking about people who will get a puppy and get shocked when it pisses everywhere and bites because they thought they came trained for someone reason, or people who will put a goldfish in a tiny bowl because they can’t afford a tank.",2023-10-03 12:59:55
People on this sub are way to judgemental.,"I saw a post saying this sub is too negative and subbed because I thought ""that's too bad, maybe it needs some positively"".

In minutes I found someone in a desperate situation who just wanted help - and one of the most upvoted comments insulting this person, saying ""YOU MAKE ME SICK"" and not at all empathetic to their situation or that they clearly weren't being flippant but trying to be careful about how they acted next. 

And now it makes sense why this place is negative - attitudes like that BREED negativity. Why is anyone going to post something positive about their pets if the responses are potentially going to tear it down anyway? Why would anyone ask for help? I understand being frustrated with people taking on responsibility and then going ""Oh too hard"".

But this was a person who had taken care of this pet for 9 years already and had diligently taken care of it in their old age for a while but just got to a point they were overwhelmed and the vet it doesn't sound like was giving them proper advice - they were explicitly asking if they should just rehome because they DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO because their own health issues were starting to impede their ability ability care. 

THAT IS NOT a situation at ALL implying someone just doesn't care. That's clearly a very loving owner who wants to make sure their pet has everything they need and isn't getting good direction or support.

And that was one of the most upvoted comments on that post! It reminds me of someone who decided to insult me and tell me I'm a bad cat owner...because my cat has a non-functioning eye that he's had since before adoption and they thought I should just be forcing him through a stressful surgery. They didn't know anything about his situation and life but decided to judge my entire character based on THEIR non-understanding 

I cannot imagine seeing someone clearly suffering and struggling and going ""I'm going to make this person feel WORSE"". I hope maybe mods institute a rule AGAINST that kind of attitude because it doesn't help a single pet or person - it just makes it where people are more afraid to ask for help and thus more likely to make uninformed decisions.",2023-10-03 01:13:39

"Want to keep a stray male cat in heated garage over winter, can I keep him from spraying?","I live in rural Saskatchewan, so possible -40 celsius weather coming in a few months. We developed a friendship with a stray cat over the past few months, he comes over everyday for some food and comfort and seems to really enjoy being with us, but doesn't exactly let us pet him yet. I want to keep the little dude from freezing to death if possible and I have a nice heated garage/woodworking shop that I could easily keep him in for the coldest months to take care of him. However, I make and sell quite a few woodworking items and I absolutely can't have him spraying piss all over my shop. Is there anything I can do other than fixing him? He would be very difficult to get into a vet, he isn't super trusting. 

There is no other animals that have ever been in my woodshop so there wouldn't be any scents of competing males, so I was thinking maybe he wouldn't have any reason to spray. But my wife thinks he'd just spray all over no matter what. I would guess he's about 1.5 years old.",2023-10-02 01:47:34
I'm afraid that my rabbit will die even though everything is fine. How do I stop being afraid of death?,"My rabbit will be 6 years old in November, he has never had any serious illnesses, currently he only has a bad eye but it is nothing serious and I take care of him as best I can. However, for the last few months I have been constantly afraid that I am about to lose him. When I spend time with him I have the feeling that these are his last moments. I have tried many times to explain to myself that everything is fine or not to think about it at all, but it doesn't help. At the beginning I tried not to pay attention to it, because it's normal that everyone worries about their pet and doesn't want to lose it, but now it's killing me. It has made me cry so many times.

What to do when you want a pet but are unsure if you'd be able to handle it?,"**Edit! : Thanks to everyone who's given me a lot of sound + rational advice! I think as i get a little farther into college I would consider fostering an animal, but right now probably wouldn't be the wisest time. I happened to find a cat cafe in my area and will get my fill of cats this weekend :D**

As the title says -- I'm a college student who is not commuting, so i'll be spending a little more time at home (i mostly stay at school to do work/study + such) My  sister had been wanting a cat and I too really liked the idea of having something to come home to since I have been feeling a bit lonely at home.

We had our own preferences on the color and I saw that having 2 cats is better than one, and surprisingly ended up finding a bonded pair of 2 yr old cats with the colors that we both preferred.

Our house has never had a pet before, and I feel like my parents are trying to dissuade the idea with how much I would have to deal with and do for them...etc. I am pretty busy with school, and I would much prefer to do most of the work as opposed to my parents (they would def hold it over my head lol), and kind of my sister as well? She can be a little careless sometimes -- so I'm just a bit hesitant there.

But, the idea of hypothetically getting the cats made me realize a bit how lonely I'm feeling and would really enjoy having a companion of pretty much any sort, but don't want to possibly be a bad owner simply because of school.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: College kid feeling lonely at home, would love to have something to take care of, but am unsure if it would be good idea with being a rather busy student.",2023-10-01 09:27:27
How do you guys handle kittens?,"I have a 7 week old kitten, had him for about a week. First time having a pet, I live with my parents and they’re not too fond with pets, especially my mom. The cat got into places downstairs where it shouldn’t be, which required me and my parents to lift up or break just to get him out and he keeps running back to those places every time he’s downstairs under our supervision and my mom became fed up with it so now he’s in my room, and has mostly stayed in my room. He’s just cooped up there all day. I feel so bad not being able to bring him out, the most I can do is bring him into my brother’s room. Although my parents do feed him whenever I can’t, it’s mostly been me who’s feeding him and cleaning him. I commute to college and my classes have absurd gaps in between so I’m just stuck there all day. My younger brother doesn’t wanna help with the cat so much so it’s mainly been me watching over him. It’s so exhausting. I haven’t had a goodnight’s rest the entire time I’ve had this cat and I am really struggling to provide for the cat. The cat is clingy, which I love about him, but he can be a bit too clingy. Should I give him away? I don’t want him stuck in my room all day, he deserves to be out running around the house playing.

My neighbours cats are driving us crazy with anger,"Me and my wife live in a lovely bungalow and we have a lovely garden which we have spent alot of money on. My new neighbour moved in next door last year and she has 17 cats. Now, don't get me wrong, I like cats and I'm not a cat hater but this situation I am in is driving me and my wife crazy with anger. The cats are constantly shifting in our garden and it's a new daily chore of cleaning it up. 
Some of the cats have even come into the house through windows and have clawed the wallpaper and carpet and have pissed in corners.  I don't know what to do. I have told the neighbour but she does not care so I have brought a pooper scooper and I now fling it into her garden. Today was the last straw. We made a lovely dinner today which the cats had gotten in and ate it and ripped it up all over the floor.

Partner panicked and “forgot” about our 2 cats during fire alarm,"I got an email from our apartment while I was at work that our fire alarms had gone off by mistake. I texted my boyfriend who I share our two precious sweet boys with (whom we both have raised since little kittens and love so so much) asking him if he had evacuated and taken the boys with him. No one knew at the time that it wasn’t a legit emergency. He answered back that he had grabbed his work backpack and ran out the apartment and didn’t think of the boys until he had come back up to the apartment and saw them scared shitless. He said he was so panicked that he forgot about them. I’m having a hard time with this now wondering if I can even trust him to save them in an emergency and how he could possibly even forget about them at all when they would be the first thing I try to save over myself even. Am I overreacting? He said he wouldn’t make the mistake again but my anxiety says different and can’t trust him now and it’s making me spiral thinking about what could happen.

EDIT: Thank you all for bringing me back down to earth. I can 100% see and understand all the different perspectives I’ve been given. I definitely overreacted and I know he loves them just as much as I do and he did feel bad for forgetting them so that’s pretty shitty of me to make him feel an ounce worse. Someone mentioned that I don’t even know what I would do in an emergency situation and that is so so true. I apologized repeatedly and feel terrible about it and it is the most important to me that he is safe first and foremost. We will definitely have a plan in place going forward and practice drills as a family.

"What's a cute, funny, or weird habit/quirk of your pets?","Pretty self-explanatory. My cat just did hers and I want to hear about everyone else's. Feel free to describe how it came about if you'd like.

When my cat Lexy was a little under a year old, she started this thing where she'd walk around the house making a sort of lilted meow/yowl (basically starting low like a yowl, but then lifting up to an excited meow) with a toy in her mouth until she found one of us or we called her. At first we thought she was MAYBE wanting to play, but when we'd try to engage with the toy she brought us she just kinda stared at us and walked away. This paired with the fact that she still did her usual ""play"" cue only confused us further. 

Eventually it hit me after I received the wonderful ""gift"" of a dead mole from one of the feral cats in the colony my neighbor and I take care of; Lexy might be doing the same kind of thing, especially since she's the sort of cat that absolutely LAVISHES in human attention. Just MUCH more direct and dramatic, because that's just kind of how she is.

So the next time she started this, I called for her. I heard her approach with her chirpy little excitement meows, muffled by her toy rat, and when she entered the kitchen with the toy I excitedly asked her, ""Whatchu got?"" and when she dropped the toy at my feet instead of trying to play, I praised her for being such a good hunter and basically put on a show of being excited about the ""gift"". This seemed to be exactly what she was wanting, as instead of usual dead-eyed stare and grumpy strut away she was meowing and chirping back at me and rubbing herself all over my legs before hopping on my lap for cuddle time.

Now, five years later, she still does the same thing at least a couple times a week, and ALWAYS when we have a visitor. No one believes us that she wants praise until they cave and do it, and in the case of new people are dumbstruck at how quickly she warms up to them if they praise her when she does it. We like to think it's her way of welcoming people to our home and testing if they're nice humans to be around, and in our case a token of affection.",2023-09-28 23:49:43

I’m in an abusive relationship with my husband’s dog and I’m over it,"Just as the title says, I (53F) am in an abusive relationship with my husband’s (56M) dog (5M). I’m not sure if I want advice or if I want to vent. 

Except for my stint in the Army and living in a no pet condo, I have always had a dog in my life. 

For context, 30 years ago my husband and I  moved out of the condo we were renting and into a rental home.  One of the criteria I asked for was to have a dog.  We bought a small dog and we have had dogs ever since.  We were given dogs and have rescued dogs.  

Six years ago my husband said he wanted to get another dog before our current rescue dies. He researched different dogs and decided to buy our current dog, I’ll call him dumbass (DA).

I have had issues with DA since he came into our lives.
I even had issues before he came into our lives. For starters, the day I found out he bought the dog, my husband was headed out of town. He dropped the bomb on me that the dog was going to be delivered on x date and x time and he wanted to make I was home for the delivery. 
I was surprised he had made the purchase because the breeder was in another state and I didn’t remember him going to see the dogs. Someone picked the dog for him and sent him a blurry picture through a text. 
In the 1st month after getting him, he started biting me.  We were trying to crate train him. I was reaching into the crate to get his food bowl and he  bit my face.  
Before the dog was 6 months old, I had been bit on both hands, my right should and both legs. He breaks skin and draws blood.  The time he bit my leg ,I had been excited about something my daughter found and when I started yelling with excitement, he bit me. 
My husband tells me, the dog has triggers and I should be aware of them. 
Here are his triggers: being excited, jumping, not putting his dog leash on in a fast enough, not taking the dog leash off fast enough, not giving him his food on time, taking away a toy… there are  so many others it’s ridiculous. 
He bit my sister and drew blood, my husband said it was my fault because I wasn’t watching him. Why did he bite my sister? she stopped petting him.  He bit my nephew and drew blood.  I can’t invite anyone over because DA will attack and locking him up is a bitch because he will growl and bark the whole time. 
And every time the dog bites me my husband will ask, “what did you do?”  EVERY TIME!
Yesterday was the last straw! The day before, I was trying to get DA away from the smaller dog’s crate.  I said, “outside.”  When I didn’t put the leash on him, he bit me. Per usual, my husband asked what did I do.  
Yesterday, my husband nearly did the same thing.  DA was in the smaller dog’s crate, my husband picked up the dog leash, the dog came running and my husband locked the small crate.   That’s it. He didn’t get bit, there was no growling, no snapping. Nothing. 
I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m just done!

Edit: WOW! There were so many comments there are just many to reply.
I’ll start with the most common comments: training the dog. I did!!! Since the dog had issues with me, my husband suggested I do the training. It didn’t work like I hoped. The dog doesn’t jump on me so big plus. Behavior modification training didn’t work either. 
The next common comment was that I had a husband problem. I’ve never thought of it that way.  When he would ask me what I did, I was just frustrated that he would suggest it was my fault. Now I have some thinking to do on that front. 
The next comment was that I shouldn’t have people over. If you read the post I wrote that because of the dogs’ behavior, I can’t invite people over. 
There were a lot of comments that made me think about my situation. 
For the many that suggested getting a professional, as stated above we have. However, I’m now thinking not all trainers are the same and if my husband won’t get rid of the dog maybe I should look into a different trainer. (Again, I’ve been thinking about the comments about having a husband issue)
Oh… and the dude that said grab the dog by the scruff of the neck, assert my dominance and throw the dog outside… Why?!?! Why would you do that to an animal?!?! What would be gained by hurting a dog?!?! Yes, DA has bit me but lashing out and hurting the dog isn’t the right answer.
For the person that suggested reactivedog thank you.
After reading the comments, I’m going to speak to my husband and try make him understand, we can’t keep going on this way.",2023-09-28 09:27:07
Is it a bad thing to take puppies away from mom when they're only 1.5 months old?,"We got a puppy from our neighbors dog who gave birth, but the whe neighborhood wants these puppies and that's why we had to get a reservation for them
There were 7 puppies in total, 3 males and 4 females
We got a male one, and the rest were given to other neighbors/family/friends, but one male puppy (Tuco) was left with his mom and he fed on her milk and played with her

Now we're noticing something, everytime the mom, our puppy and Tuco are together, our puppy is always scared? He's usually not afraid around us but everytime he meets his mom and brother he acts like a complete coward (Hiding between our legs, under tables) is it normal? Or did we get a more submissive dog?(If those exist) should we let him stay with his mother for more time so that he's used to interacting with them?

Cat misgendered,"I got my sweet cat at the end of June from a girl who recently had kittens. My girlfriend and I fell in love with what we were told was a her.

I was finally able to get her into the vet today and we found out our baby Iris was actually a male. My girlfriend were shocked and a little heartbroken as we specifically wanted a girl. We still love Iris with all of our hearts but there is still a weird, awkward feeling, especially when saying he or him. We also don’t know if we should change his name.",2023-09-27 12:43:25
Trouble getting pills into my cat,"I have a cat with serious digestive issues (something like IBS) and it looks like I will have to give him pills indefinitely to reduce intestinal swelling. Unfortunately, he is extremely skittish (was a rescue from the wild) and does not like to be held. Even petting him requires him to feel like he is at a safe distance. He does enjoy being petted, though.

My problem us that I can't hold onto him long enough to get a pill into his mouth. He will usually slash me to ribbons and then launch himself away. He completely freaks out. If I can get a towel wrapped around him so he can't flail, then I usually have success. However, initially getting him into a position for towel wrapping is difficult. I've considered scruffing him without lifting him up, but does anybody have other suggestions for controlling him long enough to force him to take his pill?

As a fyi, I have crushed his pill up and added it to his food, but he usually detects it and then refuses to finish, so he doesn't get all of his pill or his food.

EDIT: I've received a bunch of suggestions. I replied to many of them, but can't quite keep up. Thank you, everyone. Here is my plan:

1. Purchase churu, pill pockets, and capsules. Try various combinations of them.

2. If that doesn't work, I'll look into compounding.

I will try to remember to update if I find anything that works.

Thanks again for all the great suggestions.

UPDATE
I didn't see anything in the rules about how to update, so I hope an in-line update is ok.

First, let me say a massive ""thank you"" for the many suggestions I have received.

Second, I wanted to clarify that the biggest issue for me was ""capturing"" and securing my kitty while getting a pill into him. It is not safe for one person to do so without wearing full body armor. Oddly enough, he never tries to bite, but the fit he throws will slash up any unpadded body part. When my wife and I work as a team, we can get him swaddled in a towel, and then I can get pills in him pretty quickly. The only person in the family who can pick him up and hold him is my daughter. I have no idea why, but as soon as she gets an apartment that will allow pets, she will probably take him. Even for her, the window he allows being held is very short.

And finally, for the update. Although I was looking for control methods, the suggestions of ways to get him to willingly take his medicine are the real winner. Churu was a massive score. Even with a powdered pill sprinkled into it, he will scarf it down. I've tried a number of other things and he won't touch them with the medicine in them. I can't believe that I've had at least one cat at a time for over 30 years and have never noticed that churu existed. Maybe it's because I've never needed it with any of the other cats. I'd much rather have my poor kitty consume his medicine willingly because I know picking him up stresses him out.

Kitty is heading to a different vet tomorrow to see if we can find some better resolution to this chronic issue.",2023-09-27 06:25:57
"My cat got attacked by dogs, he wont eat","Recently my cat got attacked by five dogs, we rushed him to the vet. He has a deep wound above his tail and on his thigh but none of them hit anything fatal, its been three days so far he hasnt eaten anything or drank anything (he did drink a bit of water yesterday). We told the vet this and he gave him infusion(?) shots, antibiotics and something for his pain i think. The problem is, hes an old cat(13) and we are scared he might not survive because he is not eating nor drinking, the vet told us not to force feed him or anything like that. I feel like they're just cheesing us out for money and that they know hes going to die. Im usually the optimistic one in the family but the more this is stretching out the more im becoming pessimistic. What do you guys think, i certainly dont know what to think myself anymore. 
The vets told us to go get him an rtg scan to see if there's some internal bleeding or something, his other lab results say hes lost a lot of blood but in a certain parameter hes ""alright"".


Some more context: He's not really a house cat, he grew up on the streets and as he aged he slowly started coming inside our home. He'd be out and in randomly, one night he was out he got attacked (sunday i think). The wound on his tail was stiched up because it was pretty big, but he has another on his thigh that isnt stiched up and is being left to heal. We are bringing him to the vet every day, so he can get his shots and get the wounds cleaned.

Edit: Answering some common questions and suggestions.

I am NOT from America, a lot of the foods, medicins, products are unfortunately not available here :/

We were told specifically NOT to force feed him and definitely not to feed him any type of hard food (including chicken, fish etc). This also means no syringe feeding.

On that note id like everyone for the advice and for trying to help, it is greatly appreciated. The kitty hasn't made any progress but we aren't yet losing hope! Ty all, I'll keep you updated! :)",2023-09-26 21:35:00
I decided to keep my cat out of my bedroom and now I feel so guilty,"I am crying. I got my four month old boy almost two months ago. I live in a one bedroom kitchen apartment. 
I am a very light sleeper, which is why I avoid sleepovers with friends. I stay up the whole night even if no one is making noise. I can't sleep in a flight too. 
But despite all that till now my cat was sleeping in my bedroom. I have to climb a ladder to get to my bed so till day before yesterday he would sleep on my chair.
But since a few days he has started climbing up on my bed. Yesterday I could hardly get one hour of sleep. I picked him up from my bed and kept him on the chair twice but he still wants to climb the bed.
He always has access to me 24*7. I work from home, so he sleeps on my lap and follows me everywhere. Even to the toilet and the shower.
I love him and if I could sleep like a corpse, I would have him on my bed.
But the no sleep really affects me in a bad way. I get grumpy and stressed out. Which leads to anxiety too and overall bad thoughts. I am scared of taking it out on him in a fit of anger. I don't want to abuse him obviously.
The whole day today I spent emotionally resenting him, but of course I hugged, kissed and fed him.
But I feel like if I let him disturb my sleep I'll start to dislike him and I fear that the most.
Tomorrow I have to go to the office to attend important meetings, I need sleep.
I am having a hard life right now anyways, I have no one in close proximity to rely on. I am trying to avoid as much distress as I can.
Today I bought those cat repellent mats and attached it to the ladder so he can't climb it. But he climbed it anyways. I was hoping if he gives up trying to reach my bed he can sleep in the bedroom.
So tonight, I arranged two comfy beds, water, food , toys and a light source outside my room. He gets more room to play than my bedroom. 

But he is not used to that so he is meowing outside my room, asking me to open the door. I can not sleep through the meows too but I know that is something I will have to deal with.

I feel guilty and I don't know what to do. Does anyone also keep their cats or pets outside? If someone is dealing with a similar situation please tell me.",2023-09-26 19:58:21
Is it weird to reuse a pet name?,"When I got my last cat, I was still with my (now ex) partner.  I was the one to decide to get a cat and picked the name for her. At the beginning my ex said that if we ever break up I'd keep the cat since I was the one that wanted one to begin with, however over time she got really attached to it and ended up keeping it after we broke up. 

I really love the name I had picked, and now I'm ready to get a new cat but I'm afraid it might be weird if I use that name again.

What do you think?

Edit: After some suggestions and thinking, I settled on two new names, Lilith and Kerrigan, for a bonded pair of cats that I plan to adopt.  Thank you everyone for your suggestions!",2023-09-26 05:20:08
My relatives think they saved a dog but they put him a worst situation,"I recently started college and have a part time job. How is this relevant? My relatives are grown adults who sell food for a living they have done this ever since their 4th child was born. So they are pretty well off. It’s been a few years that they have had this older dog named pulga(that’s not his real name). They never have taken care of that dog AT ALL. They would give him cheap a— food even though they are well off for crying out loud they recently bought a truck one of the newest models. That cheap food caused pulga into a depressed state so I decided that I was going to take care of THEIR dog. I’ve bought him food, toys, treats, and even bowls from another relative who had a dog. This is coming out of my pocket which whatever but they don’t even ask for how much it was nothing. They have done things to pulga that I don’t even want to mention. They haven’t taken him to the groomers since they lost the dog(yeah they LOST THE DOG). So up until now his nails have been horrible so I decided to cut his nails on my own which I later discovered that he has an injury which they never treated. I was beyond pissed at that point because how could they leave him in such a state. I was exhausted of telling them to book an appointment in order to take pulga to the vet so I decided to take it upon myself to take him myself. The bill is going to be large since when I previously I called they haven’t TAKEN HIM SINCE 2021 or 2020 like man. Then after that I am going to take him for a hair cut because as you can imagine they haven’t even taken him for rabies shot since I told them ON MAY 22 of this year. 

I’ve also told them if it’s too difficult to keep up with a dog I can keep him. Another thing is that they have two high school student which can take Pulga on a walk but no the kids who are in elementary school take Pulga on a walk it’s dangerous. 

Now I take pulga on his vet appointment tomorrow hope everything goes well 

The question is what should I do? 
 
Keep in mind I’ve told them before they claim they’ll change but they never do

How can I get 2 kittens to feel comfortable around me?,"Hi guys.

I'm babysitting my sister's 2 kittens and they're pretty skittish (when I'm around). 

I'm a tall male so that's not surprising.

I've tried sitting still and watching TV quietly near them but they'd rather stay under the table 6 feet away from me.

I really hope I'm not hurting them by scaring them like this, I move around quite slowly and carefully so as to not scare them. The only times they ever come relatively close is when they hear me remove the lids off of their food, though i'd rather leave the room so they can eat alone in peace.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated! I've only really dealt with dogs so this is new for me.

Thank you guys :)",2023-09-25 11:22:51
"Why do all pets except for dogs, cats and fish seem to be awful?","In my entire life I've had 12 dogs that I've either lived with or seen/taken care of weekly. In my opinion they're very easy to take care of because I enjoy taking care of them. For example, I take my current dog for two 1.5h walks every day but it never feels like a chore. I love spending time with her so much and I'm always like a meter away max for most of the day (when I'm home). Recently I wanted to try out a new type of pet, like a guinea pig, hamster or even a reptile. Everywhere I look though it just seems like the cons heavily outweigh the pros and it's really demoralizing. Like people complaining about how much they need to clean their guinea pigs cages and how much they hate feeding their snakes or lizards. If anyone has any pet recommendations, I live in a cold climate (Canada), I have a lot of empty large spaces for any caged animals and money doesn't matter.",2023-09-25 08:25:25

How safe is it to pet-sit domesticated rats with a cat household?,"My daughter has an opportunity to weekend pet-sit two pet rats that she gets along with really well. However, we have four cats and to me that seems like a bad idea. Even if we sequestered the rats, I would think the scent would set off the cats, and the rats would probably be stressed by sensing their natural predators around. If this was a permanent adoption, then we would slow-roll it like we do when bringing in a new cat but I'm of the thought that this is basically impossible to do safely in our situation. But I wanted to check with anyone who might have experience with both types of animals.",2023-09-24 04:48:14
Pet insurance (Pumpkin) doesn’t cover my cat’s kidney disease anymore.,"Background: My cat (14 yrs) was recently diagnosed with late stage kidney disease, I had took him to Vet/Emergency room several times for screening and in-hospital care. I bought Pumpkin insurance for my cat that covers 80% of cost for each medical bill. 

What happened: Following my pet’s insurance policy, Pumpkin  has sent me 80% refund of each medical bill that is related to my pets kidney disease, the total refund I have received is around $2000. 

Last week my cat had short breath and hadn’t ate for two days, so I took him to emergency room, which costs me $10,303, however, the insurance company rejects to cover the cost for my cat’s kidney disease because they just found it is an pre-existing condition, they said my cat was diagnosed with stage 2 kidney disease in 2021 before I subscribed their plan. I love my cat more than anything and had took several days off and canceled my families trips to take care of him ever since i found his disease, if I had learned his kidney disease earlier, I would have taken immediate actions to prevent it from getting worse. However, the vet never tell me anything about the disease not mention the treatment plan, I am very sad that I’m going to lose him soon and keep blaming myself for trusting vet so much.

I know I will take him to hospital whenever he needs professional care, but I really can’t afford the high cost of each visit, that’s why I bought him insurance, now the insurance company changed their mind and is not going to cover the fee anymore, what should I do? I need some advice.",2023-09-24 04:46:36
"How do you deal with grief, knowing your beloved pet will die eventually?","I’m a rational person, but I’m also a deeply emotional person. Today I brought my dog in after finding a new lump near his groin. It’s a small mast cell tumor. From what the vet told me, they are wildly erratic that can shrink and grow. He’s a happy and overall healthy 10 year old lab. I’m a 29M and I bawled like a baby on the way home, and later on at the day at the thought of being without my boy. 

Yet I know death is natural and part of life, we all must die. Though I’m struggling to control my own emotions. I’ve lost pets before, family pets, I cried them too. But today was worse, and he’s not even dead yet. He still played as though nothing is wrong. It’s my opinion, but the dogs we get in our late teens and early twenties see us grow into full adults, they are formative years and they are with us through all the ups and downs through those years.

What advice do others have on how to process our pets mortality? I’m thinking of taking advantage of a work program that pays for a few therapy sessions per year, I’ve never done it though so not sure what to expect.",2023-09-23 11:39:44

"I now have an ""outside cat."" Is that as bad a thing as I've always been led to believe?","For context, I live in an apartment block and there are quite a few stray cats around here. Recently, I noticed one was hanging around my back porch and the steps near my apartment. I live on the bottom floor, so I've been leaving some water and food out as it's been pretty hot out lately. Since I've been doing so this cat has gotten familiar with me and my GF and has been exclusively hanging out on my back porch or near it. She can't be more than 8 or 9 months old and is sweet as pie. She lets us hold her, loves belly rubs, and is surprisingly healthy, but still obviously feral. 

I've tried to reach out about rehoming her, but there are more people trying to re-home stray cats than there are people adopting them in my area, unsurprisingly. I reached out to humane societies and they're full, and a normal shelter told me she'd likely be put to sleep after a month because they're also full to the brim.

I'd love to bring her inside, but I already have 2 elderly animals that barely tolerate each other and I know it just wouldn't work. 

As long as I'm giving her food and water, and if it comes to it, vet care, is keeping her outside so terrible? I plan on getting her shots and maybe fixed if I can find someone to watch her while she recovers.

I know keeping a cat outside is generally considered not cool, but when circumstances don't work out am I doing such a terrible thing?",2023-09-23 10:19:55

Do I have a case to take my vet to court?,"Last Tuesday the 12th, my perfectly healthy 8 month old puppy had surgery to get neutered at a clinic recommended to us by our primary care vet. The very next morning, he was displaying signs of infection like rapidly swelling scrotum and penis and purple bruising in the area. We sent a picture to the spay and neuter clinic concerned about these things and they did not think it was anything abnormal and just told us to ice the area. Wednesday night, the swelling was getting worse and our puppy was very lethargic so we called a 24 hr emergency vet to see if we should bring him in, and again was told it didn’t seem like an emergency and to wait and see if it continued to worsen before bringing him in. Thursday morning, obviously, he was still getting much worse and by this time was leaking foul smelling discharge from the surgery site and clearly had a visible infection including dark purple spots on the flesh. We brought him into the emergency er vet this time and they basically just prescribed him an antibiotic and some more pain meds and sent us home. Friday morning he was much worse, couldn’t walk or stand up, refused to eat, was leaking fluid from the infection site all over the place, still swelling up and now had black spots on his scrotum. We brought him back into the emergency er vet and they admitted it was now a bad infection and that he would need to be hospitalized there over night. He ended up staying there Friday night and Saturday night while they just had him hooked up to IV fluids and pain meds as his condition continued to worsen. Saturday night they told us his tissue was necrotic and they were going to have to start cutting it off to stop the spread of the infection. At this point, the skin down there was already starting to fall off his body on its own and was gray and black. Sunday morning they called us saying he was continuing to decline and we would need to pick him up and transfer him to another emergency vet with specialist. We were charged $5000 for his two night stay at this er vet that did very little for him. It was at the second er vet that we were told he has a flesh eating bacteria that has caused the infection, necrotizing fasciitis, and that his treatment is 3 days behind because the first er vet did not act quick enough in removing the dead tissue to stop the spread. At this point, he has been transferred to a 3rd er vet, this time at a teaching hospital with a specialist soft tissue surgery team because so much skin has turned necrotic that he will need skin grafts. We have spent well over $10,000 at this time and will likely spend thousands more on his ongoing treatment. We have already emailed both the spay and neuter clinic and the first er vet asking them both to take responsibility for the severity of his infection and file a claim with their insurance companies to cover the medical expenses we have already paid and will have to pay. The neuter clinic said they filed a claim but their insurance said they will not cover the medical bills (10,000) that we have already paid which I do not understand. The er vet has not yet filed a claim and said they need to gather more information on the case first. With all that being said, do I have a case to take one or both of these vets to court if they refuse to pay these bills? Or how can I get them to pay the bills without having to go through a long lawsuit process.",2023-09-23 01:08:46

My Cat doesn’t Groom Herself and it is costing me,"Last year I adopted a senior ragdoll cat (9y/o). I usually adopt senior animals because I believe they deserve the same opportunities to grow old in a loving home as younger pets. 

However, this particular pet requires a lot more attention than I was expecting because when she goes #2 the way she sits to do it makes it go all up and down her butt. 

I’ve done sanitary trims on her, and even with the lack of hair back there she still manages to cover her butt in …. Well yea. I always keep pet wipes or baby wipes by her litter box because I have to wipe for her, otherwise it accumulates and she’ll just walk around with it all over her back side. She doesn’t groom herself well at all and not often either. 

Whenever she sits on anything if I haven’t caught her fresh out of the litter box to wipe then it gets butt juice all over the floors. I have to bathe her bi-weekly because she’ll lay on the floors full of her butt stuff and becomes incredibly stinky. I’m having to mop the floors a lot more than usual to combat her sitting anywhere. 

Thankfully she’s too large to jump on counters, but she does like to sit and lay on soft things, as a cat would, and I’d like to be able to decorate, but I know as soon as I get a nice rug or anything it won’t even last a day.

I think I bit off more than I can chew with this one, but I feel extremely guilty about the possibility of giving her to another home because I don’t want to traumatize her. I don’t believe in giving up on pets, once you commit I’ve always been an advocate for seeing it through… however, I don’t know what to do. 

I’m in school and got a cat because they’re typically low maintenance outside of regular brushing and grooming. I’ve grown up with cats and I’ve had one of my own for years before this one. However, with me being in school and renting I can’t have her messing up these apartments, it costs and it costs A LOT.

I’m really unsure of what to do?",2023-09-21 21:40:21
"Hey, thinking about adopting a kitten or getting a pet to improve mental health under current living conditions.","I recently moved out of my parents place a little over a month ago to work on myself and live the city life for a while. Now I’m staying at this pretty nice studio apartment and I’m pretty much moved in. 

Again I’m also working on myself and trying to ease the anxiety issues that I have. I already signed up for therapy, but I also thought about getting a pet.

I grew up in a very strict dog only household because my mom HATED cats. Now that I’m on my own, I think I would like to try new things and actually have a pet of my own with no restrictions. I thought about a kitten or a cat because those wouldn’t be too bad for an apartment, right?

TLDR: thinking of getting a cat, but grew up a dog person and I’d like to hear a few opinions on this. Trying to focus on mental health and having a companion since I live alone. Also live in a nice studio apartment in the city.

Edit: My apartment does allow pets. It even has its own grooming station downstairs. Also live in front of a park.

"Advice please, I’m at my wits end with one of my cats","I will start this off by saying, my tolerance is high. I am an owner who has accepted cats over having nice furniture, they rip my sofa apart and I’m not phased by this. I’m not phased by them on my kitchen counter. They pretty much own the house. Whatever, I love cats. 


I’ve had 2 cats for 7 years. 7 years. In this time, I have one angel of a cat who I love probably more than anything or anyone in the world, I often get upset just thinking about life without her (dread when the day comes). I have another cat who has been the cause of me having to buy a new bed (this was a couple years in as he urinated on it so much it was in bits, he would literally climb into the bed and urinate on it whilst I WAS IN THERE). He is and was neutered. I stopped allowing him in there. After this, he started urinating on my sofa. Which isn’t even washable, so I have spent many days being unable to relax and even use a sofa, as I have to strip it and soak the cushion in various concoctions to try and get rid of the awful smell, it is screwed anyway. I can’t afford a new sofa.


After a long while of this, I have taken to just putting him in the (large) kitchen whilst I am not actively using the sofa as it was sending me into a nervous breakdown coming home to cat urine on the one place I can relax regularly. There is nothing too soft in there that he can urinate on. So instead, he just defecates on the wicker rug in there. Pretty much daily. He has a tray in there, pretty much doesn’t matter how clean it is, I pick up his poo from the rug every single morning. There is nothing medically wrong with him. It’s been 7 damn years of this, he’s ruined a sofa, a bed, and I am just so so so so so sick of it. Truly. I love my other cat so much, but this one just seems to add constant stress to my life. Please can I have some advice. I’ve got so close to giving him up throughout the sofa situation and it’s like I can’t do it, but all he does is make me unhappy. What would you do?

Our cat is completely disgusted by me and attacked me,"Me and my boyfriend have two male cats (2 and 3years old). He got them before we started living together. I live with them for almost 2 years. While the little one loves us and shows us equal affection, the older one is completely disgusted by me.
 Every time I touch him he starts cleaning himself, running as fast as he can away and in the cases that he allows me to pet him, he starts purring and going straight to my partner without allowing me to touch him again. Few months ago he attacked me out of nowhere, I was doing chores at home at the moment, he bit me and scratch me so deep that I couldn’t walk for few days and it left a really ugly big scar. 
 I tried to do bonding activities with him like playing, giving him treats, talking nicely to him. Nothing worked. Honestly after the attack he left me with really mixed feelings. It’s making me really sad because I love cats and I find him cute, but at this point I am wondering if he would attack me again or is he going to continue with his behavior. He is really lovely towards our other cat and my boyfriend.

Do you have any suggestions what can I do so he is at least a bit less hateful towards me?

Update 1: Yesterday I went out to buy his most favorite treats and now I am the only one to feed both of them. I am not using any perfume or lotion. He came for a split second to me, lifted his tail and moved on. I’ve got to say that this is already a step in the right direction.

Update 2:
My partner just told me that this cat was saved from really abusive ex owners and for some time, when he wanted to pet the cat‘s head, he kind of put his paws on it to protect it. Could it be connected to my current problem with him?

I want to thank you for your support and help. We absolutely appreciate it!",2023-09-20 22:19:53
Not Ready to Let Go of My Dog,"I have had my terrier mix Chewie for over 11 years now. I rescued him when he was 7. I think they got the age wrong because he seems to be maybe 14 or 15 and up until six months ago was in great shape. He's has some arthritis in his back legs but besides that was doing just fine.

 Then I started noticing he stopped sleeping in the bed with us and snuggling. He was always so loving and I remember thinking I could never imagine sleeping in the bed without him until one day he just stopped. We would even pick him up in case it was his back legs that were hurting him to jump but he jumps right out. He could no longer tolerate being held and gets very mouthy.. Wasnt biting really but if he doesn't like something he will put his mouth on our hands? He no longer responds to his name, could be hearing issues but then he started pacing, getting suck under and behind furniture and the doctor told me he has dementia. Dementia is a very sore subject for me because my grandma who raised me also has it and she's in the final stages of it so for my absolute best friend in the world to have it has really shattered me.

We have him on gallapran (?) and gabapentin for the morning for arthritis pain and trazodone at night to sedate him. The sundowning pacing has gotten so bad.. Half a tablet sometimes doesn't help and we need to try to give him to him around 6pm for it to work but one tablet is way too much. Two nights ago he was up until 2am walking in tight circles and pacing for hours.  I picked him up, put him in his bed and he immediately fell asleep. I just cried for three hours after that realizing it may be his time because what creature would want to live like this? He sleeps constantly, but when he is awake he is walking around confused with his tail between his legs and at night he's circling and bumping into walls even with the night lights I've installed. With the trazodone there have been a few nights he fell asleep and he actually slept in our bed and I was so happy to be near him even though this 14 lb dog somehow almost pushed me off the bed. Haha. He no longer barks or really reacts to visitors. 

After the other night seeing how tired he was but couldn't stop pacing I read every doggy dementia post on here trying to figure out if it is the right time. It's hard to gauge because they say to choose five things he enjoyed and if he no longer does most to let him go... He never really played with toys, he's eating and drinking just fine.. Slowly but he's doing it. But the cuddling has stopped, he liked running around but barely does that anymore probably due to his legs. 

I took him to the vet yesterday to discuss if it may be time and she noticed when he circles he goes clock wise only and said it could be something  beyond dementia.. Maybe a neurological issue like a tumor that would call for an MRI which she said is like 10k. She said the constant circling is not normal of course and he did it the entire visit. He used to hide behind me at the vet but now he just circles over and over. I don't want my dog to be constantly scared, confused, anxious. He's always been kind of an anxious dog but this is bad. I explained to her that I have a wedding next month that I have to fly home for and I needed to put him in a kennel but I'm dreading it and I'm scared to do it... She straight up said you should not put him in kennel in this condition and I agree 100%. She told me to think about euthanizing him before I leave. She told me even if I didn't plan to board him would I want him to live another month in this condition. At the end of the month we are supposed to take him to an Airbnb with us, but I noticed the last time he went to an Airbnb he did the pacing and circling the entire time... The new environments have been throwing him off and I feel so guilty traveling with him or without him now. 

It's so hard because physically he is okay besides his legs but mentally he is another dog. I'm in pain thinking about losing him but I don't want to wait until he is really suffering to let him go. Due to my partner traveling in October if we do this it would be next week and the thought makes me want to throw up. I haven't stopped crying since I laid him in his bed at 2am the other night. And of course last night the trazodone worked and he slept in his little bed. He even cuddled with my boyfriend a little before bed. I almost want to cancel going to the wedding just to spend more time with him or try different dosages of the drugs which the vet told me we could try. What would you do? I'm trying to be a good dog mom but I feel evil letting him go right now.

Edit: The doctor who saw Chewie yesterday called today to say we could test him for Valley Fever since we live in AZ. I personally got VF last summer and it's been hell ever since. It never really goes away, She said it is maybe a last hope when it comes to maybe making him feel a little bit better. I said I would call her back to let her know if I want to do that bloodwork, but reading the symptoms for dogs...I really don't think he has it and if he DID I wouldn't want to put him on another medication that may or may not make him feel better. A year later I still feel like shit from getting it. My boyfriend and I have basically decided to let him go at the end of this month before he travels back east. So we get a few more weeks of spoiling him. Thank you all for your comments and stories. I appreciate you reassuring me that it is okay to let go <3",2023-09-20 22:08:03
Leaving my baby cat alone first time,"Please share your experience how did you manage leaving your pet for a long time alone first time! I feel super anxious about it. We got two kittens and one of them died unfortunately very recently after nurturing. It was a huge stress for me. On top to this we had our vacation planned this week way before, nine days trip. Now my baby girl for the first time is going to stay lonely at home for such a long time. We left home max 6 hours before and now nine days. Of course we tried to do everything to make her comfortable: feder, water fountain, set up camera, our friend will check up on her once a day, but still. Thought of my poor baby being all alone closed in the apartment so lonely, parents can you give me advice on that please. Cause I m very close on canceling my trip.

We see the dog calm down a little and decide to go to the movies and if by the time we come back he’s still not ok i’ll take him to the vet ( we were hesitating taking him because times are tough and money for emergencies is LOW, we have a trip coming up literally this week , and we’ve taken these dogs to the vet so many times this year alone because of something they ate and ended up being fine that we didnt want to take him unless it’s absolutely necessary) i also texted my friend who’s a vet but doesnt live near me for advice and she was helping me out. We come back from the movies and he’s wobbling not as much but still shaking, still looks petrified, and now can’t stop peeing everywhere my parents were still hesitating and i said nah fuck this i’m going to the vet i’ll get a loan idc, mom comes with me and my stepdad who’s still super high decided to stay home with my other dog. We get to the emergency hospital and the first thing they ask is if its possible he ate any drugs, my mom’s and i immediate reaction was no because we thought of drugs as pills and medicine and that’s impossible for him to get into, and our main concern is if he ate a frog or something bc he catches them in the backyard often.So they take him to the back to examine him and i’m sitting with my mom in the room and i’m like “…mom could it be possible he ate my stepdad’s weed? he was smoking with them outside” she immediately gets defensive and upset at me for even suggesting that and says they meant medicine not actual drugs, and i’m like ok but the symptoms are pretty alike to weed greening out soo.. anyways long story short doctor comes to the room and lets us know our dog is high as fuck and even smells like weed :) my mom’s face of pure shock was.. very satisfying to say the least. But yeah they gave him fluids and activated charcoal and my little buddy is gonna be ok, they said to keep him monitored and go back just in case but all ended well :) safe to say stepdad got the bitching of a lifetime tho.",2023-09-20 13:02:56

Are there any GPS dog trackers that actually do what they claim?,"I don't see why most of these products are so faulty. I could strap my old iPhone 5 to my dog and track it via Google Maps location sharing and I would have it in real time, accurate down to a few feet, and it would still last a few hours. I asked one of them what the deal was and they said in the interest of extending battery life they have to sacrifice gps accuracy and update frequency. So basically instead of making a product that doesn't work when the battery dies, they've gone the interesting route of just making a product that doesn't ever work. Have you guys come across any product that works?

Petsitter lost my cat and didn’t tell me for three weeks. How do I start searching?,"My dad was supposed to look after my cat while I went to visit my mom for the summer. He didn’t tell me she went missing until I came back. He told me he tried his best to search for her but to no avail. He told me he put up signs and asked neighbors but I don’t think he did much else. With this in mind, what are other ways I can try to look for her? I know I’m at a disadvantage because I didn’t know about her being missing sooner. Anything helps, thanks <3

Am I making the right choice by getting my kitten tested for a UTI,"I have no idea if I’m being paranoid or not, and my anxiety is causing me to overthink this so I’m hoping Reddit can help. 

I’m not sure if I’m making the right choice by taking my kitten (male, 4 months) in to the vet today to get tested for a UTI. We’ve been to the vet twice in the past two weeks I’ve had him (I adopted him 9/1). The first time was because he was sneezing a lot and I was worried he had an upper respiratory infection (during out he just has allergies). The second time was so he can finish up his last dose of the FVRCP vaccine and to get tested for feline leukemia and FIV. When I saw the vet on Saturday, I brought up that I’m worried he might have a UTI. She asked if he was peeing in small amounts and I said no, but then later realized that I don’t actually know the normal size/frequency of peeing in kittens, so we didn’t do any tests while we were there. 

After doing more research, I’m regretting not getting him tested while we were at the vet. My kitten does pee frequently. A lot of times it’s golf ball size, sometimes the size of my palm. And sometimes it is smaller. He also pees upward of 6-7 times a day. He usually meows as he’s digging in the litter box, but I think that’s just his personality since he doesn’t sound like he’s in pain (but I’m not entirely sure). He doesn’t meow while he’s peeing and he doesn’t look like he’s straining, but I read cats hide pain very well. He also goes in the litter box often to dig a hole, looks like he’s about to start peeing, and then doesn’t and runs off. I did find some small clumps of pee yesterday and today that were half the size of a golf ball, so now I’m paranoid he might have a UTI. I called the vet today because I wanted to ask more questions, but instead they asked me to bring him in again. 

I’m really worried that this many vet trips is going to stress him out and that getting poked and prodded again might also not be great, but my gut also says to be on the safer side since a UTI can become serious. What do folks think? Am I overreacting or is it better to be safe than sorry?",2023-09-19 03:17:21

BF wants to bring cat to my house,"For context, I've been around cats all my life, I love each and every one of them. I used to have cats of my own until a few years ago, and now occasionally cat sit for my friends' cats. I love them.

BF and I have been together for a year. Each has their own place and we've discussed about moving in together in the future (not earlier than a year from now). The problem is, he has a cat and he spends most of his time at my place, so he suggested he brings his cat here so that she's not left alone for long periods of time.

I had thought about it myself as well, that it's a pitty to leave the poor thing alone for so long. I wouldn't mind having her here, I miss the pressence of cats. 

Aside from what would that mean for the relationship, my main concern is the cat. She is 2 years old and blind after an eye infection, and one of the most easily scared cats I've got to know. She's never completely comfortable around the space and usually hides. I'm worried that the change would be too much for her.

In general, I have a lot of confidence on myself around cats, mostly because I respect their boundaries and invest on time until they feel comfortable around me to slowly start building a relationship. I'm also a quiet person and I very rarely have people visiting. My BF's cat also seems to prefer me to his roommate. 

But I've heard some horror stories about cats taking moving to a new place, very bad. Like, getting a heart attack. 

I voiced my concerns to my BF, and told him that if she's coming over, it should be at least for a month, so that she gets to adjust to the place and not lose any sense of stability? We already bought things for her for my house, and she is to come here two weeks from now. 

Has anyone had similar experience? I expect her to hide for the first week at least, but is there anything I should pay special attention to? Thanks to anyone who shares their experience




*UPDATE*


It's been less than a week, I think Cat is adjusting good- I'm kind of surprised actually. She's visibly more chill when BF is around but in general she's strolling round the house, let me do some cuddles and regularly assaulting my carpet.

Not so good news- naturally this comes with some extra chores (litter sprayed around evenly, plus BF being around more, ergo laundry, dishes to wash etc.).

Moving Out. Should I get a pet? First time pet owner.,"When I was growing up, my family hated pets. 

We very briefly had a dog but it was moreso a dog that came into our backyard and never left. We didn’t really raise it or walk it, we just fed it and it slept outside. 

Anyway, I always wanted a pet and figured since I’m moving out soon now is the time. 

I will be living on my own in single bedroom apartment. I work 5 days a week full time but other than that, I don’t go out as I’m not a social person so I reckon me and my pet would spend a lot of time together. 

I don’t know what pet I should get. 

A dog would need to be walked and trained. And my family hates dogs and won’t visit if I have one 

A cat is more my style but I would like to cuddle and snuggle my pet and I feel like cats would just swipe at me all the time. My family hates cats too but I feel a cat would be less intrusive and thus they’d likely just ignore a cat. 

I was considering a rabbit? It feels like the best of both worlds. It’s not too intrusive and they likely wouldn’t see it as “dirty” like a cat or dog (in their minds) and I likely wouldn’t have to walk it or worry bout it being aggressive or loud.

Hi everyone, not sure if this is the right place but I was hoping to get some advice here. I was out walking my small dogs when out of no where a huge loose dog attacked them. After the ordeal, the owner of the dog showed up and apologized, we exchanged numbers and said they would cover the vet expenses. Unfortunately, my dog ended up passing away a few days later because of the severe injuries. Ever since the incident, i have reached out to them multiple times but they give excuses as to why they are unable to send me the payment. I live in California, legally they are responsible for the expenses. I've threatned legal action and that also did not seem to motivate them. I've given them plenty of time to gather themselves and avoid taking legal action but now i have a reason to believe they have been evicted. I filed a police report when the incident happened and was told to file a small claim but I do not have their current address. Is there a website I can use to search up where they currently live? I feel like i don't another choice but to take legal action. i've been very understanding but I'm angry and heartbroken that my dog is no longer with me. On top of everything i've been thru, its not fair that these people want to leave me with the financial burden. Has anyone been thru a similar situation and how did you handle it? Also, any tips or advice on small claims court in california would be helpful!",2023-09-17 11:52:23
The In-laws dogs are in bad shape and they won’t take them to the vet,"So I am completely at a loss on what to do. This involves my in laws. They have two small dogs. One of the dogs is a baby to my Boston terrier so this breaks my heart even more. 

Sometime over the summer my SIL came to visit for a month. While my husband was at his parents house visiting her, he noticed that Maddox (one of the dogs) had a mass, a little bigger than a golf ball, on the back of his leg. He brought it up to his parents and they brushed it off and claimed that they had seen it a while ago and he was just fine and it was nothing to worry about. At that point, they had absolutely no intention on taking him to the vet.

Fast forward to after my SIL left to go back home. My husband was watching his parents dogs and FaceTimed me to show the mass on Maddox.  It actually had gotten a lot bigger since the first time he seen it. So he brought it up to his parents again and they just kept saying how they had no money to take him to the vet.

So about another week later, the other dog (mya) had a massive flea problem. They blamed the fleas on my SIL. But yet again they would not take her to the vet. It even started to affect Maddox. They basically kept hinting around for me and my husband to do something with the dogs.

 I would have stepped in but we have a huge vet bill we are currently paying for. My dog, and the brother to Maddox, had gotten sick with a rare liver disease and was in the vet for over a week.  That has tied up our finances badly. We did end up going to the store and buying some flea medicine and shampoo to at least try and help with mya’s flea issues. TBH I have no idea if they even used it. 

They finally wanted to get Maddox to the vet last Friday but they will not take him in. It’s either because my FIL can’t drive or because my MIL is working. But they also just use their son for everything, even if it means for him to miss work or be put in a bind. I cant go either because I am working. 

Tonight my husband talked to them and the mass on maddox is spreading and it’s going up the whole leg and his back. It’s probably bigger than a softball and this dog is about the size of a small boston. They are starting to act like they have no money to take care of it or take him to the vet. 

I’m soooo mad. They some how came up with the money to go over 12 hours one way to pick up my SIL and her 4 kids. They brought them out here for a whole month and took care of them and even took them back home. But now they just can’t take care of their own dogs? They think mya is on the verge of passing because the fleas are soooo bad. We have sent dog food over to help them, and bought the shampoo and meds for mya’s fleas but I somehow get the feeling that we are gonna have to pay for this or else the dogs just won’t see a vet at all. 

I don’t know if I should turn them in for animal neglect. Who would I even call to do that? Would they know I called? They don’t have a lot of people over and I think the only ones who know about the dogs are us and my SIL. 

Need some advice please!",2023-09-17 11:24:29
Are cats easier pets than dogs or was it just a bad experience in my case?,"I remember when I was a kid my family babysat a dog. And the first thing it was shit on my bed. And then it barked 24/7. And it was humping my leg. And it was constantly wanting attention. It was a nightmare.

But then in college I lived with my brother for four years. He had a cat. He was so chill. All I had to do was feed it and clean his litter box. Most of the time it just wanted to be left alone and chill. Yeah, sometime it would purr and do cheek rubs. Which was fine. But it didn’t want attention 24/7 like the dog.   


Is it usually how it is? Because I kinda want a pet. I think dogs are cute but I‘m thinking of maybe getting a cat instead if all dogs are like this.

ALWAYS check references for pet sitters and don’t ever trust them completely,"Just a PSA and vent. I know I messed up. 
I hired a pet sitter from my apartment complex because I had a work trip for a week and found it comforting a pet sitter would be in the same building. I met with her in person before I left and explained everything that needed to be done which was not much. (Wet food in morning, dry food bowl filled, water bowl filled, clean litter). It would take 10 minutes tops. 
This woman didn’t give my cat dry food or water for the entire week. I hate myself because she was sending pictures and I never looked closely at the water and food bowl in the pics. It wasn’t until I got home and the water bowl was bone dry that I looked back through the pictures and sure enough you can see the water levels lowering every day and by Thursday she had none left. 
As a result, my cat ripped up the carpet next to the bathroom door trying to get in to get water since she sometimes drinks from the tub after I shower and probably figured that was her only option. 
This woman should not be a pet sitter. Her excuse was she didn’t notice the water or food bowl was empty. Am I crazy for just assuming it is common sense to check those things every single day and better yet to put fresh water and food every day??? 
I feel ashamed that this happened. I should’ve heard from previous clients (if she even had any) and I should’ve set up one of my cams to keep an eye on her food and water. 
Don’t let this happen to you and your fur baby.",2023-09-16 12:42:59
Why does the vet want $1000s in testing for occasional vomit?,"Just frustrated, because I’m bringing my cat to the vet tomorrow for some inflamed looking gums. While I’m there, I plan on mentioning that she throws up sometimes, like every 3 ish weeks to a month. She grooms well and mostly grooms her lazy brother so it always has hair in it. Anyway, last time I brought her to the vet and mentioned this they said they wanted to get an x ray, some other scan, run bloodwork, etc. listen…I’ll die for my cat any day. But I grew up with cats, cats be throwin up sometimes ! They’re gonna do a checkup and a fecal, and I know they’ll tell me she needs more testing that I can’t afford. Obviously if there is other cause for concern that makes further testing extremely necessary because of something other than vomit that’s different, but they tell me this every time and every time I say nah cats vomit they just have to give me all the options and I leave feeling terrible that I didnt fork over 4k in testing. Idk…am I crazy? Do I need to let them do hella testing? She eats, drinks, sleeps, plays, snuggles, everything else is normal.

EDIT: dudes, I’ll do whatever I have to do to keep her happy and healthy, I’m just frustrated because vomiting doesn’t seem like cause for soooo much money in testing but I will do it if I have to. Yes I have pet insurance, yes I will stagger the diagnostics, and yes she goes to the vet regularly.ALSO $4k was dramatized i was quoted like $900 for all they wanna do, it just feels like 4000 to me 🥴",2023-09-16 11:24:56

Should I keep fighting a ridiculous dangerous dog designation?,"Edit to address multiple comments- I’m not a backyard breeder. You people jump so high to your conclusions your in danger of just floating away one day.

He comes from a very good bloodline, but more importantly he’s my best friend. It wasn’t in the immediate plans, but I wanted the option to continue his legacy. 

He really is probably the best dog I’ve had. It’s sad that you are judging him from one situation where things stacked up enough that he couldn’t handle one more trigger. I wonder what you would say if your dog bit someone or if you yourself have never been overwhelmed enough to do something stupid? 



Original post-

I should probably post this is r/legal as well, but I want some other dog owner’s opinions. The end question is should I take up the fight again and is it at all realistic that I eventually win? Sorry in advance for the length.

Back story- In 2019 I took my two German Shepherds to the vet for their yearly check up and vaccines. It was storming pretty heavily after we arrived so my male was pretty nervous, even outside of the fact we were at the vet. They had already taken each dog and weighed, drawn blood and did rabies vaccines and we (2dogs and I) were sitting in our little room waiting for the vet to tell us the blood test results. 

The female was loose and easy, but the male was sitting on my foot pressed against my leg. An office worker came in and both dogs stood up to greet her. We chatted a minute during which the male sat down close to my leg again. She asked if she could give them treats and I said yes. She gave one to each, but the male didn’t eat his. At this point she got down on her knees and wrapped her arms around the male dog’s neck, hugging him, with the side of her face pressed against the side of his face. It took about 5 seconds for me to see what was coming, 6 seconds for his lip to curl in a growl, 7 seconds for me to say “No!” and eight seconds for a small piece of her lower earlobe to be on the floor.

She rocked back on to her heels and stopped for a few seconds. All the while my dog was just sitting there like nothing had happened. She left the room and things were a little hectic after that. I took both dogs to the car and apologized profusely. The vet then came outside and we spoke briefly. I told her I was so sorry, I felt guilty, I never should have let her hug my dog, but he had never done anything like that so it wasn’t something I ever suspected. She then informed me that they had marked his chart as CAUTION because at his previous visit he had growled when doing blood and vaccines. No one ever informed me of that, but I still felt I should have asked her to back off my dog. I should never have let her hug him. She was a stranger and I should have protected him from an uncomfortable position.

The next day I received a phone call from animal control requesting my current address. Stupidly I gave it to them and they showed up later that afternoon to take my dog. I called a friend that is an attorney and she informed me that I did not have to turn him over if they did not have a warrant. I signed paperwork agreeing to quarantine him for 10 days and they left. I naively thought that was the end of that. Monday morning comes and you would have thought I was Pablo Escobar. My street was lined with police, detectives in suits, it was nuts. There were a good 15-20 people there to watch my dog perp walk. When I brought this dangerous nuisance dog out he didn’t pay a bit of attention to the strangers all around and went straight to my car thinking we were going for a ride. One officer even reached out to pet him until I stopped him with an icy look and “you’ve got to be kidding.”

After the 10 day quarantine period was over they informed me they were deeming him a dangerous dog and in order to get him back I needed to be in compliance. I was good with everything except I didn’t want to neuter him. I asked if I could come into compliance with everything else and get him out while we waited for the hearing I requested. They refused. I spoke with specialists, attorneys, you name it, I tried it. They were unwilling to budge and refused to release him before the hearing. So I found the man who teaches the dangerous dog courses for our state and told him the whole story. I also reached out to one of the top ranked dog behavior specialists in the country. They both found the whole situation ridiculous and blamed the woman. The DD course teacher actually came to the hearing in our favor. The magistrate, who works with AC all the time, treated him so badly I was embarrassed I put him through that. He literally stopped him mid sentence and said “I don’t want to hear that dog psychology mumbo jumbo.” Needless to say we lost the case.

I came in to compliance and allowed them to neuter my dog and he was released to me. He was sent home with a poorly closed wound that ended up opening completely the next day and cost me $700 for another vet to put him to sleep, clean it out, cut off the infected skin and properly suture. 

This was three years ago. We have to register and pay yearly, carry $100k liability policy and several other things. The worst part is AC comes every few months to inspect our house and we can no longer travel with our dog. We can’t even leave the house with him without letting them know all details. I could have/can appeal the magistrate ruling and take it in front of a circuit court judge. I don’t have the money to pay another attorney to do this, but I can represent myself. I’ve already found several court cases that classify what she did as provocation and therefore unable to have him classified as dangerous, but it’s no guarantee. I would love to have AC out of my life for good, but is the whole fight worth it? And can I win?",2023-09-15 13:20:09
is it cruel to keep cats in a cage for most of the day?,"please do not downvote me cuz im not doing this i dont even have cats.

***For all the people who don't believe that im a minor or i dont have a job, f** off! i dont care what u believe or dont believe! im here to get help lol... and if you're misreading my comments, reading in between the lines making assumptions, or just straight up LYING about what i said to other people in these comments; GET A LIFE!!!!! If u need me to clarify, jusy ask or message me. Im here for advice and help which i already got. so, ahem LeNerdmom , GET OFF MY PAGE! i dont care if u dont believe im a minor and frankly its weird that ur stalking my page to see where i work and accuse me of not working there? dont believe me? this post isnt worth ur time!*** (but as mentioned, i already know what i need to do thanks to other comments, but this does not include *unfortunately* breaking into their home and stealing the cats)

my boyfriend's grandma has two cats that i helped to foster when they were kittens. we aren't on good terms anymore but she houses the cats now. she keeps them inside a cage all day and only lets them out to pee and poop. one of the cat i helped raise as a baby, i ask my boyfriend to bring with us whenever we go out, but the other cat belongs completely to her so he stays home. they stay locked in a cage all day and i feel so horrible. i suggested to my boyfriend that he gives them away if shes gonna keep them locked up all day but he said its not his decision. 

she doesn't keep water in the cage. so when bf opens cage, they go straight for the water bowl and drink nonstop. this making me think she dehydrate or neglect them.

personally, i think its cruel. but she says its okay bc she lets them out for a bit everyday. For reference, the cage is approx 35in.x20in. long. Cats are 3 months old and stay in the same cage. There is space for them, and a dog food bowl which she keeps in their cage. is it wrong?

EDIT: am aware about what to do. to the comments rhat were able to give me advice or message me about my options and suggest resources, thank you. i have taken your advice and began to explore my options for help
***I already plan to call animal control and shelter after school today. Please stop telling me to take the cat away when i cant, despite what u think. i will be calling the shelter***

to the ones who choose to be judgmental and rude despite not knowing full circumstances, please take a break from reddit. you can give advice and still be civil about it

please understand the situation: if i could take immediate action, i absolutely would. however , i do not live with them

for those telling me to gather photos and videos; i cannot because i dont live with them. but! as comments suggest i will wait for them to admit or usher them into admitting abuse 

for those telling me to just steal the cats and give them away. please be realistic . i dont have a car and their house isnt within walking distance. i dont have keys or anythinf else. how do u expect me to break in and take them lol. if u want to give me advice, please be reasonable.

What's the most respectful way to ask if someone hurt your dog??,"(Edit: thank you everyone for your responses and for validating my concerns. I just need to trust my gut feeling and stop bringing him. I will contact the owner later and tell them about my concerns.
Edit 2: even if nothing bad happened, he is still communicating to me that he doesnt want to be there, so I am going to listen to him. Thanks again everyone for your input and advice!)

I dont know if I should just change daycares or if it's okay to ask the owner if anything happened to my dog. Let me start by saying I am a professional dog groomer, and I of all people know that most dogs don't want to be left with someone and they put up a whole show, but once the owner leaves, they're completely fine and walk back to the salon with me. I know a good deal on dog body language as well. 

(Some info: My dog is 2 ½, pittie, and very well behaved/trained. Every daycare he goes to loves him. His daycare is a small business run out of a barn with a huge fenced in area attached to the barn. I chose this place because it's smaller and he could get better care with less dogs for the employees to tend to. They don't take any more than 20 dogs a day. Ive taken him there no more than 20 times, he only goes once a week)

This daycare I've been bringing him to was good, but recently it seems to be going down hill. The other day when I was dropping my dog off I heard someone angrily yell at a dog to shut up/stop barking (listen, again, as a dog professional, I know working with dogs can be emotionally taxing. But it irked me how angry they were, and people who work with dogs know that just yelling at them isn't going to make them stop?), he started coming home not even tired he still had so much energy as he would if I had him in a crate for hours at work (he comes to work with me so I can make sure he gets bathroom breaks), and the past two times he has been reluctant to go with the lady who takes him inside. The first time he was only a little hesitant, his ears went back, he lowered his body into the seat of my car and he didnt jump out without me asking him to. The second time, today, he did the same thing except worse, he was showing a lot of submissive behavior, and backing all the way into my car and i had to pull him out.
This might be normal for some dogs especially if they have separation anxiety. But my dog is never like this, he is pretty good about leaving me and was always super excited to go to daycare and was tuckered out by the end of the day. 

I feel like I might be being paranoid, and I absolutely do not want to accuse someone of hurting my dog because I know first hand how awful it feels to have some accuse you of doing that (crazy customer, story for another time lol!) but theres no denying that his behavior is not like him, and worrying. I want to ask if something bad happened to him, but Im not sure how. Or maybe I shouldn't, and I should just trust my dog and take him somewhere else. 

Sorry there might be details missing because I'm trying to write this quickly at work to ease my anxiety as he is there right now. I also dont want this post to get too long. I just would like some insight from other professionals and pet parents. Am I being paranoid?, should I ask if something is up? Or should I just leave quietly?",2023-09-14 22:11:23
What is the best way to lose a pet?,"As in: what’s the least traumatic way a pet can die, both for the pet and for its owner? 

Our 14 year old dog just had a scare, we thought he’d had a stroke but it turns out he has vertigo caused by an ear infection. We all had said our final goodbyes to him as my husband took him away to the vet—now we find this out and he’ll probably be home tomorrow! Which is absolutely wonderful, but now I can’t stop thinking about how it’ll go when it IS his time. And I just can’t wrap my head around it. 

We had to say goodbye to our favorite cat just this past February, when we found him breathing all wrong and learned he was in CHF and there wasn’t much they could do—that was unexpected, felt cruel (he was only 7) and really awful for the whole family…so I know that’s not it. Has anyone ever had this go not completely terribly??

ETA: you guys, thank you so much for sharing your beautiful stories. I had no idea how much I would find comfort in reading them, it helps to not be alone. 

Our old man is still at the vet hospital, but things are looking good! It’s possible that he has a brain tumor and not just an ear infection (ok that didn’t sound good) but he is up and walking around and eating and happy. I now know that we will bring him home, spoil him for as long as we have, and once he seems to be in pain, or stops eating, or starts not being able to pee or poop outside, we will have our vet come to our house to help him go while we hold him and sob. It’s the best way. 

We’ve had him since he was 8 months old, he’s a rescue from NC. We have a Christmas tree farm and he’s a bit of a local celebrity (not really), many families can’t wait to see him each year when they come get their tree. It’ll break our hearts if he doesn’t make it to tree season but I’ll absolutely let him go before that if it’s his time. He’s just the best boy.",2023-09-14 10:53:14

Where can my grandma's weird pets go when she dies?,"My grandma has seven chickens, four ducks, two cats, and a tortoise. My aunt has chickens, so she'll probably take some, but I don't think she'll be able to take all of them. Idk if she wants/can take care of the ducks or other animals. The cats honestly might not make it (women in my family die OLD) and if they do we could probably take them to a no kill shelter, but the tortoise really concerns me. What on earth do you do with an orphaned tortoise? Or the ""leftover"" ducks and chickens? I love animals, but the only person in the family fit to take care of any of them would be my aunt and she definitely can't take all of them. Like I said women in my family die old, so we won't have to deal with this soon, but probably within ten years. I know that's a lot of time, but it's just been on my mind.",2023-09-13 11:20:06
Update on my gf’s cat,"So I called a couple shelters to surrender her cat & I had to make an appointment. There’s nothing available until next month. I’m still waiting for a response for the second place I reached out to as they didn’t answer so I sent an email. I didn’t bring it up to my girlfriend but I did talk to her about how she was being abusive to her cat. I told her it was wrong & not fair & it made me feel upset. I said that it made me sick to my stomach to think that we might have kids in the future & if she was like that. She started feeling bad & crying. Then she started self loathing. She said she’ll try to be better. I told her she better try hard, not just for me but for her cat. Her cat deserves a better home with people that actually love her. She hasn’t hurt her since i talked to her about it. I’m skeptical that she’ll actually change so I’m not going to let my guard down. I still plan on breaking up with her & getting her out of my house. I want her cat to be okay first. I shared some papers i got in therapy & it seemed to open her eyes & make her realise that she’s in the wrong.",2023-09-13 06:49:26
Please help,"
I had left my two guinea pigs under a relatives care because I was going out of town for a couple of weeks. My piggie had ran out of hay so I gave her money so she would be able to buy some. I come back and one was fine, but the other one is just sitting in a corner. She barely moves, she doesn’t squeak, she lost weight and when I say their favorite word(snack) she doesn’t even respond. At first she would nibble on some veggies I would offer, but now she doesn’t even show interest. I asked and turns out she didn’t even buy the hay, and has been feeding them random vegetables around the house. She claims she cleaned the cage but it is very filthy, and most of their toys and hiding places are gone. (I was not making her do this for free, I payed her)

I tried calling multiple vets and they are all either closed, have no appointments till next week, or don’t even take guinea pigs. I tried syringe  feeding her a mixture of pureed pellets, water and other vitamin rich veggies but she does not want it. I checked her teeth and they do not seem overgrown. I’m sorry for how unorganized I am but I am really freaking out. Is there anything I can do for now? I looked at the emergency medical guide y’all have, but I’m not sure. Please any advice helps.",2023-09-12 11:53:28
Is it ok for my animals to sleep with me on my bed?,"I have a cat and a dog that I absolutely adore and have had them for a while (my cat since I was 7 and my dog for 3 years, I'm turning 18 now). Honestly I've never had a problem before but ever since I got my dog I noticed I've been waking up with puffy eyes, sneezing, basically the typical allergy symptoms. I wanted to know if anyone has developed allergies to their animals over time?

It's not that bad and I really honestly don't plan on ever making them sleep separate because my bed is basically their own and them cuddling up to me is the cutest, I'm just curious if anyone has this problem or if it's harmed their health.

EDIT: Thank you to all the wonderful answers! Also to say a few things, I already have severe asthma and many many allergies. I also Groom my animals and change my sheets weekly! I think it might have to do with my weak immune system after reading some comments and suggestions! Thank you once again and I will for sure never stop cuddling my cute fur babies to sleep❤️

"Carpet apartment, bad cat allergy, is it at all possible for me to have a cat?","Hey y'all!

I have wanted a cat my entire life, but aside from one absolute babe I had as a small child, I've never had another one. Now as an adult, out on my own and with someone who supports me endlessly (including wanting to get me a cat), I have one problem. 

My boyfriend and I live in a pretty small apartment, 2/3 of which is carpet. As the title states, he is decently allergic to cats. He can't stand to be in a house with a cat for more than 30 minutes before it gets overwhelming for him and he has to go outside, and that's without the cat in the same room as him. 

That being said, he wants me to have a cat just as much as I want one. He's even looked into hypoallergenic cats and made me a list of cats I could potentially have, if I'm willing to spend the money. My coworkers have talked about food you can feed them to make them less allergy producing? I'm not too sure how that works or if I trust it fully. He does have a good friend who's also allergic to cats, but his fiance has multiple, so I'm trying to get him to ask his buddy for any tips. I figured in the meantime I could come here and see if anyone has any advice. Is it possible for me to have a cat without massively inconveniencing his existence? Any and all advice is super super appreciated, and if this is successful I'll remember everyone who helped make my lifelong dream come true 🥲

Considering behavioral euthanasia,"I desperately need advice so thanks to anyone who reads this. My cat is only 6. I adopted him as a young cat, and when I did, the shelter warned me that he had missed the key socialization window and that they suspected he would have lifelong socialization issues. This has rung true. When it’s literally JUST me home, he’s happy. Comes out from under the couch, wants to be pet, etc. I met my husband a couple months after adopting my cat and he has always been scared of my husband and anyone who enters my house. My mom is here weekly and she’s never even pet him, for example. My son was born 2 years ago and since then he’s basically under the couch or another piece of furniture 24/7 unless if my son is asleep and my husband is out of the house, or its the middle of the night, despite the fact that my husband is nice to the cat and I don’t allow my toddler to chase or harass him. 

Like 3 or 4 years ago he was diagnosed with idiopathic cystitis also known as inflammatory bladder disease. It’s a disease that’s not very well understood. It happens mostly in cats with high anxiety levels. Their bladders get inflamed and when this happens they have painful urination and they pee outside of the litter box (because they associate the box with the pain they’re feeling). Let me list the things that my cat has peed on over the years when he has flare-ups… our basement carpet which we had to replace for thousands of dollars, our 2 couches which we had to throw away, 2 armchairs, multiple carpets, inside suitcases, in my hamper. I don’t want to make this about the material things, but I have to admit it’s really hard living in an environment that is frequently being urinated in. My whole house smells like urine, guests have commented on it. He has a flare up of his condition every 6 months or so, and when he does it lasts about a week with blood in his urine and peeing all over the house. The flare ups have no clear cause. And I think the flare ups have just generally taught him that he can pee wherever, so I suspect he pees outside of the box even outside of flare ups of his condition. I’ve gone through multiple bottles of enzyme cleaner.

I’ve done a lot to try to fix this. He’s on Prozac. He’s on a specialized prescription diet. I keep the environment as peaceful as possible. Never light fragrant candles or anything that could bother him. Never try to take him out from his hiding place. Rarely have guests. Have tried a bunch of litters and nailed down one I think he likes. Boxes on both levels of the house. 4 litter boxes. Have tried with and without a lid. Different litter box sizes, different litter depths.

I woke up this morning and my new armchair was saturated with urine. I’m at my wits end. I’m pregnant right now so the house is just going to be even busier this time next year. I don’t see how this situation is sustainable. As a last resort I called the shelter I got him from and the lady I spoke with, very kindly but bluntly, told me that the shelter is willing to take him but that frankly he is not adoptable and will not have the happy ending with an old lady that everyone envisions for a cat they rehome. She told me she recommends euthanasia. On one hand I was floored but I also kind of expected it. I don’t know what to do.",2023-09-11 05:41:17
"Advice needed involving neighborhood ""stray"" cat","A few weeks ago I noticed a new cat on our street. I called out to him and he immediately came running over to me, not shy at all. No collar or identifying tags whatsoever. He kept following me around the yard while I was working outside. He was very sweet and personable. I gave him a few cat treats and came inside for dinner, but he still stayed in the yard for about 10 mins.

Saw him again the next day, but further down the block. At this point we started getting worried, as our street sees a fair amount of traffic, some not abiding by the speed limit. I posted a notice on FB and Nextdoor with photos of him and our location. A volunteer from the city shelter recognized him and said he had been adopted from them in January. She said he was chipped and to bring him in so they could scan him and alert his adoptees. Brought him in the next day, and they immediately remembered him, and said he'd lost a bit of weight. They held onto him while they tried to contact the owners.

We didn't see him for the longest time, until yesterday. He is unbelievably skinny now and not as spry as he has been. Fearing for not only his safety, but his life, we took him in last night to feed him and let him get some rest. He's currently in our downstairs bedroom with food, water, a litter box, and bedding. My wife slept with him last night and we've been spending time with him all day. We already have two cats, and need to keep them all separated because we don't know how our cats will take to him. We're keeping him again tonight, and taking him back to the shelter in the morning. I posted again on social media but have not heard anything.

Is there anything that can be done to make sure he doesn't get back to his current owners? They are clearly not taking care of him at all. Also, he's declawed, so he as no way of defending himself. He absolutely should not be outside. He's devoured the food we've given him. We're hoping the shelter can intervene and do something? It's a no-kill shelter so we're not worried about that. He's very sweet and have no doubt someone would adopt him. He needs a good, loving home, and clearly does not have one.

**Edit 1 (there will probably be many as I update this):** Instead of taking him back to the shelter, we are taking him to the vet in the AM. But he's currently curled up next to me with a belly full of food.

**Edit 2:** Took him to our vet today for tests/blood work/etc. He tested negative for kitty AIDS, we get his other tests results back tomorrow. I posted an update on social media, a volunteer that used to work at the shelter said he's on meds and we are working on getting that info. At this point we are going to work on keeping him, just needs to see how he integrates with our other cats. If it doesn't work out, I know of a family in the neighborhood would accept him and treat him lovingly. He is 100% not going back to that shelter. We'll see how the next couple of days go, but he is getting well fed and taken care of. Thanks to all that have reached out! Also I should note, he is NOT DECLAWED! He hides his claws very, very well!",2023-09-11 05:30:08

My grandma refuses to take her dog to the vet and he has an infection. What do I do?,"My grandma’s dog Bear has been with us so long in my life. He was one of the labradoodles bred by my parents that my grandma adopted so I’ve literally known him my whole life. He’s almost 12 years old now and he’s has sores on his legs that he keeps biting at. He smells like he has an infection (my mom is a nurse so she knows what it smells like.) and my grandma will not take him the vet. She says it’s a money issue, but she pays $40 dollars a month to put him on a vet plan, so the visit will be free. If he needs X-rays or antibiotics she has to pay for that, which my parents have agreed to help with, but she refuses that too. 

Yet she will to have him groomed once a month for $100 dollars, so I don’t know what’s going on, but I would like to help to him before it’s too late. Please help!

Update: Thank you all for your concern and advice. It took a lot of convincing but we will be taking Bear the vet tomorrow morning. Hopefully it’s just antibiotics needed and not anything more serious. I’ll update when we know more.

Update 2: We took him to the vet this morning. They said he didn’t have an infection, but they gave him anti inflammatory medication and apiquill for the itching. He also has diarrhea a lot in the mornings so they gave him meds for that as well. It came to around $427 and she let me pay for half of it as long as she can pay me back.

Is rehoming the right thing to do [help][advice],"Tough situation ahead.

My dog possibly killed my brother’s cat. 

So it’s been a pretty rough ride the last couple of weeks.

A couple weekends ago I went to my sister’s wedding out of town. I left my dog (husky mix) at my parents house with their full husky and a pet sitter who agreed to watch the animals for the weekend. Unbeknownst to me, my brother’s cat was also being boarded there for the weekend. He says he didn’t know my dog was staying there either. 

Very traumatically, the night before the wedding, we get a phone call from the pet sitter letting us know there was an incident and my brother’s cat was mauled by one of the dogs. He did not see or hear it happen because he was watching a show with headphones on, but he suspects that it was my dog because of the way she was acting and he hadn’t seen her for a bit. There were no obvious signs of scratching on either dogs, but there was quite a struggle and a pretty rough scene to discover.

My brother was gutted, as this cat had been with him through a lot of ups and downs over the past decade. We were all devastated and while we showed up for my sister and put on a brave face for the wedding, we were all pretty emotionally rocked the whole day.

My brother is obviously very upset and would like us to do something with our dog (either re-home or euthanize). Things are very tense right now because of it. I would be devastated to lose my girl, but I want to do what’s right.

A couple other important things to note. I have two cats myself that our dog has lived with for two years and she has never shown any aggression towards them before, nor since the incident. They have carried on as normal, and they often snuggle up with each other. She also shows no other signs of agression to people or kids. Still, we have been watching them like a hawk and have been careful not to leave them unsupervised for any amount of time while we figure out what to do.

Another factor is that an incident preceded the death of my brother’s cat when my parent’s dog bit my dog over a chew toy earlier in the day. So tension in the house was running high and they were with an unfamiliar person. 

We are tortured with so many regrets and what-ifs. We had planned to hire our own pet sitter, but my parents convinced us to let their friend watch the dogs. We also wanted to have our friend come get our dog after we heard about the bite incident, but decided against it. Rumination sucks. And the thought of potentially having to give our sweet girl away has been making me really depressed and ill. Even though she probably did something terrible, I have to remember she is a dog, and part husky no less. I still love her and want to protect and keep her. But I don’t want harm to come to my other feline friends, or my family relationships. 

Things are pretty rough right now. Some very hurtful things were said, and it’s going to take time for this to heal and get better. Thoughts? Advice? I’m not looking for adjudication, but I want to make sure I’m keeping perspective in all of this. Thanks.

Edit: Thank you all for your comments, suggestions, and advice. It’s very helpful to hear other people’s perspectives. It’s a tough, complicated thing and right now nothing seems right or fair, but I guess that’s life. It holds no punches.

A couple clarifying things. I would not consider euthanizing, as I couldn’t bring myself to do it, nor do I believe that is the appropriate thing to do unless aggression was an escalating problem with our dog. So far, there has been no sign of that. My brother accepts that, but still believes the responsible thing to do is find a new home, which I am still seriously considering. 

As far as the pet sitter goes. I do wish I had been more questioning the night of, but they were pretty shaken up as well. Everyone sort took it at face value that our dog was the culprit, myself included. The cat had stayed with my parent’s dog for an extended period of time before without issue. Their dog has aggression problems with people though, which seems like the bigger issue to me. But I don’t want to be pointing fingers when there will probably never be a way to know for sure. It’s a mess. Right now, my brother believes my dog was involved for sure, and maybe the other one as well, and he will probably put the same request on my parents.",2023-09-10 01:00:06

How soon is too soon to get another cat after your cat dies?,"My beloved cat who was only 3 died suddenly (within a minute) traumatically due to an underlying heart condition. This happened a month ago. This was very shocking as he showed virtually no clinical signs. I was absolutely devastated. I loved that cat more than I have loved any animal. My boyfriend feels the same way. This happened a month ago. I cry intermittently about it. I have a memorial for him in my apartment. I will never forget him. 

However, I have always had animals in my life. They are very important to me. I’m a vet student in an extremely rigorous and demanding program that chips away at my mental health. I also have mental health problems. Having an animal relieves just a little bit of that pain. I am feeling like I would like another cat. But I am worried. My last cat I loved so so much. He was aggressively affectionate, goofy, and never ever caused problems (no peeing outside litter box, no biting, etc.) im worried about another cat not being this way. I’m also worried it is much too soon to get another cat. My kitty died a month ago. I feel like I’m not honoring him by replacing him. I also feel like it isn’t fair to the other cat I’m bringing in to be a “replacement.” Also people may judge if I just replace my beloved cat. 

I guess what im asking is - when is it too soon to get another cat?

Edit: wow - thank you all so much for your support and kind words! I adopted a 3 month old girl from a rescue today. She makes me so happy. I feel like we rescued each other! I will always miss my sweet boy. I think about him all the time. He will forever be in my heart. Thank you all for your responses ❤️",2023-09-09 22:05:55

2nd ETA: I would never buy him an animal w/o him knowing 

 I think my partner needs a pet, he’s been very down and I found having a pet really helped me. Problem is he lives in an apartment that gets incredibly hot in the summer (+30c/+86f) so he would need something that could withstand that. It would also have to be very low maintenance as he doesn’t have a lot of spending money. Is this even possible or am I describing a unicorn?

"Local Humane Society Shelter Refusing Adoption Because I'm a Lesbian, What Do I Do?","I'm not sure where else to post this, I'm sorry.

My girlfriend and I have been trying to adopt a cat for a while now, we have a good record with animals, a local vet, up to date vaccines, everything. We found a cat we really like and put in an application, and fair enough 2 other families were interested in the cat as well. However, the locale humane society shelter has been handling things in a deeply unprofessional way with obvious discrimination to the case.

We live in deep south and are open about who we are and that we are in a romantic relationship with each other. When we went to adopt, the lady asked if we were roommates or a friend just tagging along, and we said that we're together and live together, something that earned an obvious scowl from this woman. Her demeanour changed COMPLETELY and she became less willing to give us information, talking in circles to avoid answering question, constantly interrupting me to prevent me from speaking, etc. Whatever, the rest can be done online/over the phone. We submit out application and it's not approved, they call to tell us that our pet (a small dog) isnt up to date on vaccines and I say  they are. The woman on the phone, who I'm pretty sure was the same woman, says she called the vet herself and they have no record of us. I ask her to give me a moment, call the vet myself, they say  they have all our records and will happily call the shelter to confirm. Cool. Great. I wait, get a call back from the vet saying they called, cool. I call the shelter again, get the same lady, same answer ""your records arent up to date, app denied"". After some talking, I get my case brought to the director's desk and think maybe I'll be able to do something and the front desk lady tells me she'll be reviewing all the open cases for this adoption since multiple families were interested so they can find the best home for the pet and that they'll have an answer for me next week. Okay cool, that's great!

This was 2 months ago.

I've called twice since then to check up on this, and was able to speak to another woman besides the first who then tells me suddenly ""oh yeah, Lady 1 threw your file away because she said y'all weren't interested anymore"". I ask to talk to the director and get transferred, and the director tells me she wasnt even aware of my application or interest in this pet. I went back and forth on a lot of this and was told I'd be getting a call back today, and its been 3 hours since then. I called to follow up and was told to just be patient. Time has passed since when I was told  to expect the call, and it's become obvious to me that I'm being given a run-around by people who clearly dont want me to adopt.

Maybe it's a bit fo a stretch to say it's because I'm gay, but the crux of this started with a woman who very obviously homophobic and has been lying/getting rid of records to prevent me from even being in the discussion - This has turned less about adopting and more about sheer discrimination and unprofessionalism; is there anywhere I can repor this kind of behavior about this or am I just fucked because some old hag doesnt like her fruit?",2023-09-09 03:31:17
Are cats really this smart?,"I have an indoor cat who unfortunately got fleas this summer about 2 months ago. I’ve been doing all the things, flea medicine, spraying furniture/carpet and lots of vacuuming.

Anyway, about 2 weeks ago my cat has started to avoid the floor at all cost. She jumps across furniture and table to avoid the floor. She also mostly only stays on non-fabric furniture like tables, stands or dressers. If she has to touch the floor she does a full sprint to get off of it asap. 

Does she really understand that the fleas/eggs are mostly in the carpet and is purposely avoiding them? Are cats really that smart, has anyone else’s fur baby done the same?",2023-09-08 19:47:06
Preventive rabies vaccine,"Preventive rabies vaccine

This is something that I still can't understand why every pet owner doesn't do, let me know if there is something that I've missed?

Rabies is considered to be fatal even if the slightest symptoms start to show up. So it's either be safe, or be dead. With rabies vaccine available for cheap in public hospitals, shouldn't pet owners get it as a precaution every year or two?

In my case, playing with my dog involves the dog regularly catching my arm with its mouth or scratching my legs with its paws. Isn't there a chance that a minor wound somewhere might go completely unnoticed?

What are your views on preventive rabies vaccine for pet owners?


EDIT: I'm confused why PET OWNERS don't take the rabies vaccine as a precaution every 1-2 years. Sorry for not posting my question clearly :')",2023-09-08 13:23:42

Why is a cat with a collar waiting all night on my doorstep?,"I’m genuinely confused. This very sweet cat owned by one of my neighbors (idk which) keeps waiting overnight, every day, on my doorstep. We have other cats so I thought maybe he was friends with one of our cats but he acted like he’d never met them. This is like the third day he’s spent the night on our porch, why won’t he just go home? We don’t wanna let him in cause we’re not the kinda neighbors to steal a cat with a COLLAR, but we don’t know what to do. We haven’t fed him or anything, either. We’ve pet him a few times but other than that he’d have no reason to choose our house specifically.",2023-09-08 07:51:17
10 year old golden lab accidentally consumed cooked onions,"Without me knowing until hours later, a friend of mine fed the other half of her burger, which I had put about 2 teaspoon of diced onions in the whole burger before cooking, so she’s had roughly 1 teaspoon. She is a medium sized dog and seems completely fine but wanted to ask opinions because I know onions are toxic for dogs. Thanks I’m advance.
Edit:
Thank you for everyone’s replies. I did end up calling a friend who is a vet and she confirmed it was likely not a big deal, especially considering my dogs size and the quantity consumed. I appreciate the help and feedback so much we all love our pets. Have a great week!",2023-09-07 21:59:21

My 6 year old cat is having a hard time with the fact that other cats exist. ~1 year old cat (a stray I’ve been trying to transition inside) who isn’t housetrained had an accident in the corner of my CARPETED bedroom. Understandable. I dabbed up as much pee as I could and then soaked it in Resolve Urine Destroyer.  Dabbed that up, sprayed some more. That was last Thursday night. In the past 6 days since, my cat that I’ve had for all 6 years of her life has peed in that corner 4 times.

 I’ve repeated the same steps as above each time, but she chooses to pee there while I’m sleeping (waking me up with scratching), so I can’t catch her sniffing around and discourage her. Can’t close my bedroom door while I sleep because it’ll get to unholy hot temperatures. I’m thinking about taping aluminum foil all over the area. Wtf can I do?",2023-09-07 13:31:43
Neighbors dog keeps showing up at my house. Any advice?,"
UPDATE: They came and got him. Thank you everyone, I don’t think play dates or dog sitting will be in the future unfortunately. 


There is a husky that keeps showing up at my house. This is the sixth time. I have his owners contact information, but sometimes i wait for them to contact me so I can spend time with him. My husky passed five months ago and it’s very nice to be in this dogs presence. He lays in my lap, cuddles me, and LITERALLY has opened our back door to come hangout with us. He has been at the house for seven hours at times and no post was made, and the owners made no effort to contact me and ask if we had seen him. Which makes me feel like they either don’t know he’s gone, or don’t care. He is bathed, and fixed, so I know they don’t abuse him. I just don’t want him to continue getting out and potentially getting hurt. We love him, and he obviously loves us because we can tell by the lack of dirt and panting that he runs straight to our house. I also obviously don’t want to break someone’s heart and take their family’s dog. What’s the best thing to do?

More information for new people seeing this post, he was at my house for almost two days before they asked about him and came and got him. They said they made efforts to call out his name and that he gets out when they let him out to go to the bathroom. Owner said it’s her boys dog, so the likelihood of rehoming or play dates are low.",2023-09-06 13:54:09
Should I take my cat with me?,"My cat is 6 years old and has always lived with my mom. The last 4 years I’ve been able to see him a few months every year. While he’s primarily lived with my mom, he’s always been ‘mine’

Recently though I brought up taking my cat with me to my new apartment and my mom was against it and wants to keep him. I’m not totally opposed to this and just want what’s best for the lil fella

Do cats adjust well to new environments after only knowing one home? How can I make it as easy on him as possible?

I’m primarily concerned with his mental health cuz he’s on anti-anxiety medication (He bit one of my mom’s guests; my theory is my mom’s house has 3 dogs and can be quite busy so he’s stressed out all the time)

"Single and work full time, looking for advice owning a dog","As the title suggests I’m single and I work full time, overnights actually 10:30pm - 6:30am as a local news producer. As such, I get no breaks and go a full eight hours at work.

I’m really lonely in a new city, been here about 5 months and miss my dogs back home every day. I really want to adopt a dog but worry I’d only stress it out by being gone that long with nobody else to look after them throughout the day. I still haven’t quite made any friends here outside of coworkers as I’m usually working while others are sleeping and vice versa. 

Is it possible to have a furry friend with my schedule, or would it be too hard on them? Despite how much I want to adopt, I don’t want to stress out the dog in any way.

"Cat has vomited 6 times in the last 24 hours, hasn’t touched his food and has diarrhoea.","I’m so worried, he is completely unlike himself. When I had noticed his dinner from last night hadn’t been touched and all the vomit he had done in the night, I had called the vets in the morning. 

They had advised that he may have a stuck hairball, and to try offer him boiled chicken, to see if he can keep it down. He usually loves chicken, however he is completely uninterested. He is yowling when I pick him up, which he never does either. Do I make an emergency appointment or wait it out?


UPDATE

We did get an emergency appointment at the vet. During the initial examination vet said that he is extremely dehydrated, and his temperature was way higher than what’s normal. 

However due to his vomiting and diarrhoea which she suspected was gastroenteritis, she didn’t want to prescribe anything to lower his temp as it could worsen his other symptoms, she did prescribe him anti nausea medication to help him eat. They ran some blood work, all came back normal thankfully! We have a follow up appointment tomorrow to see if his temperature decreases, if not he will have to stay the night at the vets on fluids, but fingers crossed his temp lowers by then!

Anti nausea meds have helped slightly, no vomiting yet and he has had a little bit of chicken and some churru treats, he’s still feeling sorry for himself but acting a little more normal 🤣 but all in all nothing seriously concerning, hopefully he’ll be back to the goofball that he is!",2023-09-05 23:13:07

My cat has been meowing and peeing nonstop.,"Since last week we have noticed that one of the cats (female, spayed, 13) has started meowing loudly and continuously for no apparent reason and peeing a lot out of her litter (and drinking more than usual), mostly in a specific point of my bedroom; she has never been the vocal type, however she has had multiple problems with cystitis in the past, so we thought that might be the case. We soon noticed that there was no blood in her urine (like when she had cystitis), on the countrary it looked almost fully clear; what's more is she's been particularly picky with her food, so we gave her chicken, but after just a couple of days, she looked like she was tired of it already. We have a vet appointment in a couple of days and I really hope we can sort this out; but still, I am litterally going insane because of her meowing.

I do not have the means to take her to the vet earlier than two days from now.  Just PLEASE, if anyone has had a similar experience please tell me how you dealt with it. I don't know what to do anymore.

P.S.

I forgot to mention that she's borderline underweight and has always been, she's always been very picky with kibble so we've always given her wet food (specific for her cystitis problem), but not as much as right now. And no, I don't think she's meowing because she's hungry, I've tried multiple times to feed her when she meows and when she eats what I give her, she does so reluctantly, and it doesn't stop the meowing. Also, we always have kibble outside that she can eat whenever, it's not like she can only eat when we feed her.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

We took her to the vet, turns out her kidneys aren't functioning well. We got her many different types of wet food designited for those problems (in addition to the one we were already giving her because of her cystitis problem) to make sure she doesn't lose appetite; she also got prescribed some supplements, although she doesn't really like them so we have to sneak them in her food. Lastly we will be increasing the fluids we give her. We have currently no way of knowing if the meowing was related to her kidneys issue or not: if her kidneys get better but she still keeps on meowing and acting strangely, it's probably dementia, she's an elder cat after all, it's not uncommon. Only thing we know for sure is she wasn't meowing in pain, she was just really destabilized. ",2023-09-04 17:54:07

Should I call animal control,"Okay, so long story short I was facetiming my parents when the neighbor dogs got out and started eating the dear food in the yard they had put out. Come to find out they are breeders and have 7 dogs in a 676 sq ft house. Some full grown some puppies. My mom said one of the dogs that hopped the fence looked emaciated. Still facetiming my dad as he’s walking the dogs back over and I see 2 full grown golden retrievers in a kennel together. They don’t even have enough room to turn around. So instantly I got pissed and I said I was going to call animal control. My parents had witnessed that they had been free in the backyard all day and just now put them in the kennel. I’m worried they will be out there all night in the kennel. My parents told me not to call animal control because they animals are “fine” and “that’s just what breeders do.” My parents are also cowards and would rather stay friendly with their neighbors than cause problems and actually help these dogs. Idk i’m just very frustrated and don’t think it’s right to keep 2 full grown dogs in a kennel that they both can’t even comfortably lay down in. What do you guys think?",2023-09-04 11:10:44
Elderly safety inspectors do not allow pee pads in the house?,"I have an older neighbor who recently had a housing check after her last fall and hip replacement surgery that was completely unrelated to her small dogs. She had fallen  in the bathroom. She lives with her adult son and adult grandson who look after her and care for her. 

The inspector who came in to evaluate the conditions of her home to make sure it was safe for her to return said that they're not allowed to have the pee pads in the house at all, and that the dogs had to be taken outside or allowed outside every single time, even in winter.  The only other issues in the home were they wanted them to install additional bars in the bathroom, since they only had 2 and they had to expand a doorway to make it more handicapped accessible. 

This was the first I have heard about restrictions on things like pee pads for elderly inspections and am wondering if anyone else has encountered this?  She is unable to take the dogs out herself so now her son and grandson have to do it, but are worried about being able to do so every single time and that the dogs are just peeing on the floor when they remove the pee pads and are not signaling if they want to go out at all because they're used to the pee pads. The dogs are elderly too and are not very willing to change their ways either so what options do they even have now when the inspector already told them they had to remove the pee pads from indoors entirely. Doggy doors are not really an option because of the other wildlife in the area. Ideas on what they can do? TIA",2023-09-04 10:50:21
Why are regular vet checkups important?,"(Im 17 m btw, still living w my mom) Im taking my 6 pets (1 cat, 2 dogs, 3 birds) to the vet for a checkup this month, as they're due for one. Its probably my cat's first checkup like ever, and mayyybe one of my dog's, because now I have a job that I can get them checkups and can take them the same week/month

The thing is, my mom never takes them for checkups, hence why its probably my (old, 15 year old) cat's first time later this month. I told her I'm taking the 6 to the vet and she's like 'why, that's such a waste of money'. So that's what I'm asking here. Why take them to the vet for checkups? I dont think she'd take her 2 dogs, her reptiles, her 4 birds or dozens of chickens, to the vet ever. Unless of course, there's an emergency. Even then never the chikens. She did take my one dog to the vet for an emergency a few months ago but still doesnt like checkups.

It just really bothers me. She's not always good at proper animal care yet has so many. I didn't even buy any of my 6 pets (only have bought my tarantulas but i dont count them rn), they were either gifts to me or just became mine.

This is kinda just a rant but also asking for thoughts and to help reason with my mom why they need regular checkups. Its good for their overall health, helps catch things early, etc. What else can i do to explain this stuff to her?",2023-09-04 04:39:30
I think I need to rehome my cat,"My cat has been making my life very difficult. She pees on my bed, my pillows, blankets, rugs, kitchen/bath mats, clothes. If I leave something on the floor she’ll poop in it too. When I’m trying to sleep, she’ll keep pawing at the sliding door which makes a banging noise. The door is open so it’s not like she’s trying to get in or out. She ruined my last couch and is ruining this one. 

She used to use her litter box and scratching pads. I tried getting her a new litter box, didn't work. I’ve had her for about 3 years. She didn’t start getting difficult until like 6-7 months ago. It’s just too much for me to be doing so much laundry and constantly cleaning up after her. It keeps getting worse as time goes on.

I adopted her because she showed up on my porch and wouldn’t leave for a few days. I made sure she didn’t belong to anyone by getting her checked for a microchip; no one claimed her when the Humane Society posted her on their lost pets site. She used to be a super well behaved cat and we had a great bond. I live alone and work from home. It’s already overwhelming to take care of my place by myself at times. I’ve also recently become sober and am trying to better my life. For the last month I’ve been working on getting into a more consistent, healthy routine. She has definitely been disrupting that.

Idk what to do because I love her, but I feel like this is a time in my life where I need to think of what's best for me. I would feel so guilty rehoming her, but I also feel like I may need to for my own well-being. I don’t know who would be willing to take her with the issues she is having.

**TLDR:** Is it super fucked up of me to rehome my cat? She has become a disruption to my life during a time where I need as much peace as possible.

EDIT: I took her to the vet 2 and a half weeks ago and they took a urine sample, she did not have a UTI. After reading some comments I think it may be a territorial issue bcuz cats have been hanging out in my yard and underneath my house off and on since the spring. I have been seeing 2 specific ones more frequently recently and I know at least one of them is a male. I also know for a fact she absolutely despises male cats 😅",2023-09-04 03:29:53
"I love my cat, but I've become suddenly allergic to him","Hi everyone! So I need some advice: I have one sweet cat (he's about 3 years old) and I am allergic to him now. I love him to death, but my life is so much harder and I don't know what to do.

I brought him in off the street a few years ago; he stole my heart immediately! He was so malnourished then, didn't stop purring for several days straight when he came home, and he's been by my side since. Unfortunately about a year ago, I suddenly developed horrible allergies after exposure to one of my friend's (very fluffy) cats and my body has been through hell since. 

The allergies were really bad at the beginning (my eyes would swell practically shut, I was struggling to breathe, etc.) but over time it's gotten better. I thought I could get through it, and I've been taking allergy meds/using nasal spray everyday, but it is just been so consistently difficult.

It's not great for my cat either-- I feel so bad every time I'm in bed and he comes up to cuddle and I have to push him away (he's allowed everywhere else, but I cannot have fur/dander on my pillowcase). I try to groom him (the brushing somehow makes it worse idk how) and it does help to give him baths (I don't do this frequently-- I don't want to stress him out and I'm just so busy). I vacuum and clean regularly, and I've bought an air purifier that has helped only slightly. I've also considered getting allergy shots, but apparently you have to get them weekly for years and as a college student, that's not easy (logistically, financially, time-wise). 

I love him so much! He is the sweetest, most outgoing and affectionate cat I have ever known, and just overall such a spunky little guy. We've been through it together, and I can't imagine my life without him. But I wish I could live life without these allergies!

Maybe I'm just frustrated right now (I'm writing this after sneezing literally 8 times in a row, several times, and running through an entire small pack of tissues in the past 10 mins lol), but it's not always this bad and most likely things will just keep going as they are. But I will admit sometimes I wonder if it would be better to re-home him, the allergies are such a constant struggle and it has put strain on our closeness (no longer can he lay on my lap for hours at a time, I start dying; giving him too many scratchies will blow my sinuses up for hours; I wake up with swollen eyes at least once a week and its embarrassing to leave the house, etc). I live with my boyfriend who isn't allergic (curse him), so he still gets his love and attention (just not from his favorite person, me, hehe). 

Are there any other options that I maybe haven't thought of? Please please send any ideas my way. I don't want to have to part ways (it would be so so difficult for him and it would crush me too), but is that what has to happen now? Maybe he'd even be better off ?? I'm at a loss. Please let me know, thank you guys so much!! :') <3",2023-09-03 15:58:49
"I want to adopt a cat, but im worried my apartment will be too small for him..","hello, so I know this question must've been asked many many times, I read some threads about it, but I still feel the need to outline some things and ask it myself..  


so a person I know got a Canadian Sphynx kitten, and for some reasons he can't keep it..  
I want to take him off his hands, I like him, he's  funny little dude.  


problem is I live in a very small apartment.. I decided to get myself the minimal space I need as long as I don't have a family, so I basically live in a tiny half studio apartment..   


I have a small patio, but I don't think I'd like to let a cat of mine to roam freely outside here.. especially a sphynx, he will be either kidnapped or killed   


 will such a cat do fine in such a space?  
I read about people suggesting to make cat runways that'll utilize the 3D space in the apartment.. but I think im not going to do that..I might get him a tower and build him a small house and a bed..  


will such conditions be cruel to a cat?

My friend keeps getting new dogs. It's making me sick!,"I have 2 cats and recently got my first puppy. I have always loved animals, and view them as a part of the family. My friend (I'll call him Tim) has always had cats and treats them as family members. He adopted his last cat as an elderly boy and took very good care of him for his whole life. 

When Tim told me he was getting a  Pit bull puppy a little over a year ago I was surprised, but supportive. He got it through his (now) ex bf (I'll call him Aiden). After Tim bought the do from his ex, Aiden decided to take the puppy back, and only reimbursed Tim a little bit for him. 

He was sad, so he adopted an adult pit bull from a shelter. He had her for a few months, but since he lives with his mom and psychotic brother (that's a whole other story) the dog got aggressive. Tim brought her back to the shelter, whi said she was too aggressive so they had to put her down. Tim was heart broken! 

So what does he do? He rescues another dog (surprisingly not a pit bull) from another state. This was a big dog, and his mom lost him within the first couple days of bringing him home! They found him, bust still couldn't handle him, so since my fiances son was looking for a new dog, they just took him in. 

At this point Tim still wants a dog, and is determined to have a pit bull, so he adopts a pitbull puppy from a breeder. He has had this puppy for a few months, I think he is about 10 maybe 11mos now. Tim says this puppy is super sweet, but too unaware of his surroundings and Tim is afraid the puppy will knock his mom over. His solution: a friend of his is taking the puppy so Tim can pick up a new pit bull puppy this Saturday. 

I'm passed! Tim is such an irresponsible dog owner and expects me to support his decisions. He us super excited about this puppy, and everything he talks about it, it just makes me sick. Who seriously thinks it's OK to trade animals like this?",2023-09-02 22:50:11
Why have an outside pet?,"I've never understood the point of keeping an outside cat/dog. My neighbor had a really friendly chubby cat, but she was an outside cat that was unfortunately ran over a few days ago after being away for a while. I felt so bad, but also felt that could have been prevented if she monitored the cat better. There are many dangers to these creatures, from vehicles running them over, someone taking or harming them, predators, and injuries/diseases that can be prevented when they are homed inside. Personally, I think pets should have the care, resources, and love from inside the home. And yes they can still go outside. I understand some people don't have those same options as others. Just wanted to hear from some people who have ""outside"" pets. How do you manage their safety, especially those pets who run off for days at a time and why?

Edit. I don't mean farm animals or shepard dogs, chances are they have lots of alotted/fenced land to roam and not just randomly fleeing their home. I mean domesticated pets that don't have dutiful jobs, like people who have cats and dogs that leave home regularly for days/weeks at a time.",2023-09-02 08:05:16
"Pet sitting, was not told the house had fleas, any advice?","So, long story short, an old family friend asked me to pet sit for them this weekend. I walked through the place last night with them, they told me all about the pets, (3 dogs, 2 cats) it took about an hour. We spend the rest of the night with the dogs, who were very excited to have new friends! Rolled around on the floor with them and everything, they loved it. It was a great first night.

Fast forward to today, while eating breakfast, I feel a tingle on my legs. Do a quick smack, lo and behold, it's an fn flea. I contacted the owner and got the info that they've been dealing with them since they moved into the new place, ""it's a process, believe me"". That information would have been dope to have yesterday. 

I have 2 kitties at home and i absolutely DO NOT want to bring a single flea home to them. I brought 2 cloth laundry baskets full of laundry, 2 playstations, and 3 backpacks, and my car with me. I have longer hair down below my shoulders and a big bushy beard that im hoping i dont have to cut off, but im willing to if needed.

planning on getting 2 cats should I get both at the same time or stagger?,"Hi so as my title says I plan to get a cat. Well 2 so they will have companionship while I am at work. Should get them at the same time or get 1 then the other a few months after?

Edit I have had cats before but never 2 at the same time.

Compromises for cat-owner and cat-hesitant to move in together?,"Love my bf but hesitant to move in together because I don’t want to hate my living situation for the below issues. I used to have a cat but its been years and I’m somewhat addicted to having a super clean space. However what compromises of changes have you made with a partner to solve any of the below issues? From either perspective of cat-owner or non cat owner moving in with your SO

1) cat keeps me up all night by walking on me, pawing my face, purring loudly on our heads (I mind this one the least but gets annoying after he just woke me up out of a dead sleep by pouncing on my belly). Literally exhausted all day following staying at his place 

2) claws the carpets very minorly but a bit

3) litter smells awful and makes my bfs clothes all smell really bad from the closet

4) puts his face in my bedside water glass at night and licks the rim

Please help


**Edit** thank you for all the good advice. I don’t know why a tumbler instead of a glass didn’t occur to me but that’s an easy-ish solve. **Otherwise we will talk about what people are suggesting:** keep the cat out of the bedroom at night, improve the litter setup, and provide scratching stuff.",2023-08-31 23:52:12
Newly adopted stray cat is just... there,"I recently adopted a 2 year old orange stray cat from a volunteer friend last month and until now, she is still hiding under beds and couches, staying inside boxes/basins/ anything with holes. For the whole day, she would not move her spot (at all.) unless I move her or its feeding time. She also doesn't move away if I put her on my lap or near me, unless she needs to feed or use the litter, which then she goes back under the bed. I'm not joking when I say that some days I only see her thrice, and thats because I look for her. She's also very quiet, rarely meows unless hungry.

&#x200B;

Is this really her behavior? She's been like this since Day 1 and I thought she just needed time to settle in her new home. But, it's getting concerning that she's just... there

EDIT (UPDATE APRIL 4, 2023): thank you all so much for the tips and advices! she’s entirely different now, in the best way possible. we have her enough space and just took our time with her and now she’s turned into the most affectionate and cuddly cat ever. she’s also very talkative and would be very vocal for our attention. thanks everyone!

I'll start,
 The other morning(4am) I was woken up by 3 year old cat(who always sleeps with me). She grabbed my hoop earrings(they are small) and pulled on it! Guess I didnt give her the attention she wanted, so she started chewing on my engagement ring and my watch.

Btw, I was wearing all of this while it was happening.

I’ve repeatedly asked my mother to deal with this, but she doesn’t. The cat litter box does not get cleaned enough and the cat dislikes the dogs (one anyway).

Allergic to my roommates cat,"I moved into my apartment about 3 weeks ago, my roommate has a cat who is super sweet. The only problem is I’m allergic to cats. When I first moved in it was a very mild allergy, I used to be around multiple cats all the time (worked at a animal shelter and would petsit cats) a year or two ago and rarely had any symptoms. Now I have a constant sore throat, which goes away as soon as I leave the apartment. I currently take allergy medicine (zyrtec), but I don’t know what else to do. My apartment won’t let me switch rooms, and I can’t move out as I’m locked into the lease for a year, and not allowed to sublease it. 
The apartment knew of my allergy when they assigned me to this room. I had specifically said not to put me with another pet, as I was supposed to bring my dog who is an esa, and told them I had a cat allergy. I requested to switch before I even moved in, and explained why, but they said that they don’t have any available rooms to put me in. 
My roommate has been really good with keeping up with the cat as well, cleaning and switched his food to an allergy friendly one. Any suggestions on how to manage cat allergies better?",2023-08-30 07:51:54

Why couldn’t my cat find food?,"My cat fell from my window and was missing for 3.5 weeks. I looked for her everyday. After 2 weeks i assumed she died and stopped looking. One day after work, my neighbor saw my car coming down the street and ran to me and said, “I just saw your cat! Come on!” I parked and ran after him. We called her name, and she answered with a very faint and weak “Meow”. I ran home to get my glasses and to get her cat food bag. I kept calling her and she followed my voice until she saw me. (I couldn’t get to her due to my neighbors crazy huge garden) She ran up to me and started rubbing her face against me. My neighbor took the food and i picked her up and I felt sick. I could feel, every bone in her body. She must have only weighed 5 pounds. She has long hair, so you couldn’t really see right away how skinny she was. I took her to the vet and she had an injury on her head (probably from a fight with another animal) and also was in starvation mode. They told me she had about another week to go before she would have died from starvation. My question is, why couldn’t my pet cat find food? Is her being an indoor only cat making her handicapped? I thought she naturally would have been able to find SOMETHING to eat, but she didn’t.",2023-08-30 04:12:47
HELP: Roommate is neglecting dog,"TLDR: my roommate(26 F) is gone 10-18 hours a day and is never around to care for dog. Denies the neglect and gets aggressive when confronted. 

My roommate is never home to take care of her dog. A few months ago she started working in the restaurant industry and is gone every day for 10+ hours (10 is being generous). She will go to work at 7 am and not come home until 1-3 am. It appears that often times she works and then goes out with coworkers and doesn’t think to come home and take care of her dog. Even on her days off she will be gone most of the day without coming home to go hang out with friends instead of caring for her dog. She never takes the dog with her anywhere.

The concerning part is that she leaves for such long periods of time and never makes arrangements for her dog to be cared for, not even with us. She just assumes someone will be home to take care of the dog. 

We have confronted her multiple times about this. The first time she was apologetic, the second time she got defensive, and the third time she got extremely defensive, mean, and aggressive. After the first confrontation things only got worse and she got more avoidant of the house, and therefore her dog. All we had asked is that she text us and ask that we let her dog out when she was going to be gone for long hours. Ultimately we just wanted her to be more present in the dogs care and assume responsibility for coordinating her dogs care. Assuming someone will be around in the up to 18 hours she is gone is unfair to us without consent and irresponsible dog ownership. The dog rarely gets walks and when she does it’s a 8 minute fetch session across the street. The dog receives no training and the only time she gets with her owner is the handful of hours she is home to sleep at night. When I recently confronted her, I even suggested she rehome her dog (even temporarily) while she gets her life together. 

The most horrific part to me is that she is gone for these long hours to go party after work. She is completely blowing off the responsibility of her animal to get wasted with college students. (We don’t have definitive proof she is partying, but I don’t see why else she is coming home intoxicated at 2-5 am. Her bar closes at 11pm/12 am. She denies going out but I don’t believe it. Just want to highlight this is an opinion) 

I am concerned for the dogs well being, and the only reason she is receiving adequate care is because of myself and other roommates. I am at the end of the rope of taking care of her dog, especially if she is going to be cruel to us and we can’t have a rationale conversation about it. 

I am concerned on how to make a change in the situation because my roommate is just avoidant, defensive and aggressive. When confronted she just grasps onto semantics and specific situations like “I was home all day yesterday” “I just took the dog for a walk last week” “I’m home for multiple hours a day before my shift” etc. instead of owning up to the fact that overall she is not home enough and when she is she doesn’t care for the dog. She pretty much sleeps, stumbles out of bed and lets the dog outside, goes back to sleep while her dog whines at the door for an hour to be let in, then when she wakes up again she lets the dog inside and leaves for work and doesn’t come back for long periods of time. 

I work from home and am here pretty much 95% of the time, so I see how often the dog is alone and am caring for her most days. 

Idk how to get across to her that being home for one day (which rarely ever happens anyways) doesn’t make up for the dogs required care EVERY day. 

I am to the point where I fear the only thing I can do is tell her I’m don’t helping and being taken advantage of, and let the dog be locked in her room when my roommate isn’t here, so that she can come home to an energetic, neglected dog and to pee and poop in her room, so she can understand that she is not meeting her dogs needs. 

This just strongly goes against my moral codes and I’m not sure if I’m capable of letting that happen to the dog. I can’t call animal control because it’s not criminal neglect. That doesn’t make this situation right. We have almost a year left in our lease. 

I have my own dog and I think my roommate is taking advantage of my compassion and dedication to my own animal, knowing I won’t let hers suffer. 

Idk how to move forward in this situation.

EDIT 1: I feel like I should give a bit of my roommates side of the situation: she works as a bartender 30 mins away, she doesn’t have a car, and doesn’t have a lot of money (according to her). She has been using these things as a way to avoid accountability even though this was her behavior before she totaled her car. 

Ultimately, she does have a lot going on, which is why my roommates and I expressed we were happy to help, we just set the boundary of clear and explicit communication when she needed help with the dog. We never received that. And maybe I’m an AH, but I don’t think any of these factors devoid her of her responsibility of caring for her dog, or at the very least ensuring her dog is cared for (it seriously baffles me she can be gone for such long hours and not make sure her dog has been cared for with even a simple text to us). And I feel like if she can’t accommodate her life to responsibly owning a dog with her current situation, she should consider alternatives (rehoming). I don’t think any reason or excuse can rationalize neglect.

EDIT 2: thank you for all the input! Super sad to see how many people have been in a similar situation. Please keep in mind I am very angry about this situation, and that my post is biased. Facts of the post are still true. 

At the end of the day, my roommate does love her dog, I think she is too caught up in what’s going on in her life to properly care for it though. She would notice immediately when she got home if the dog was gone. 

Animal control can’t do anything if there isn’t documented neglect (I already checked on this). 

There isn’t documented neglect because my other roommates and I care for the dog. We let her out as she pleases, she plays with my dog as they please, she hangs out with me all day, etc.

My roommate meets the bare minimum needs of the dog. She feeds it and sleeps with it. Could the dogs situation be worse? 1000%. Doesn’t make it right though. 

My roommate leaves for 10 hours (generous) to 18 hours (more extreme end of it) most days. Very regularly 12-16 hours. 

As some have pointed out, it’s the principle. The way my roommate is prioritizing and assuming responsibility for care for the dog is wrong. Bare minimum is to just shoot a text our way and ask or sit us down and ask for help. She just disappears for long hours, comes home and sleeps, then does it all again. 

Her circumstances were much different when she first got the dog. She actually used to be a pretty good dog owner. I will say though, even then she would leave for way too long without arranging care (not even with us roommates), it just happened infrequently enough that it wasn’t a big deal. The ignorance I describe has been going on since march.

** points I want to clear up that I fixed in the post: she lets the dog back inside before leaving for work. How much she is partying is my opinion and probably biased in my anger. Fact is she’s gone a lot.",2023-08-30 01:31:21
"People who let their dogs sleep in bed with you, what do you do about your blanket?","Hi! 
I've been going through something rather traumatic and have started clinging to the things around me that I love (i.e. my husband, baby, and dog) I feel like everything is falling apart around me and because of this I've started letting my dog sleep in bed with me so I feel safe at night.

My only problem is that I can't get my dog to give me the blanket. I've brought four blankets in here and each time somewhere in the middle of the night I wake up freezing and my dog in a blanket nest. I've tried to persuade her to move out of it or at least just give me one but she's very adamant that it's all hers. 

My husband sleeps hot so he doesn't even notice that there's no blankets.

UPDATE: 
Wow everyone I was not expecting this post to blow up as much as it has. Thank you everyone for your tips and tricks on how to co-sleep with my pup, it's all much appreciated. 

Although she's still a blanket hog this post definitely did a wonderful job of distracting me from the things going on in my life, and for that I can't thank you all enough. I've tried reading every comment but they just keep coming and I'm losing track 😅",2023-08-29 12:02:32
Neighbor Says We Stole Her Cat,"Let me start this with a little bit of background. My neighbor feeds every stray and feral cat in the neighborhood. We live in a duplex and share a front and back yard. There have been over a dozen cats in and out of our front yard over the past three or four years, with 5 or 6 living on her front porch at any given time. They multiply every year and we have never complained, ever. We have two inside cats and we understand someone who loves and cares deeply for animals. They have torn up our plants, pooped on our porch, nearly tripped my elderly mother running around her feet, and we have never said a word. We’re very much a keep the peace and do not make a fuss kind of neighbor.

This past Friday, one of the kittens belonging to one of the stray cats, quite literally walked into our house. We put it back outside several times but it would dart in around our legs every time we opened the door. We could not help it, we fell in love, fast. It was an adorable, affectionate all-black kitten who immediately acted like he had known us his whole life. We knew financially it would be quite an undertaking, we rent and it is a $300 pet deposit per animal. Additionally, this kitten had a terrible eye infection, was full of worms, and extremely malnourished. We also considered our neighbor and immediately called her to make sure it was okay because we did not want any conflict. She did not answer, but we left a detailed voicemail about what had occurred. She did not return our call and we decided to have a trial run for the weekend before completely committing. By Monday morning we were absolutely certain and head over heels in love and paid our pet deposit and gave the little guy a name, made a vet appointment, purchased supplies, etc. We never heard back from our neighbor and assumed it was no problem. 

This evening, our neighbor texted us after listening to the voicemail and wanted to know which kitten it was. We described what the kitten looked like and she responded back saying that kitten, “belonged to her 7-year-old daughter and she had been taking him to the vet.” We were immediately shocked, she has had feral and stray cats come and go for years and has never claimed ownership of any of them. Additionally, she has made statements in the past about not being willing to pay the required pet deposit. Furthermore, we have seen this kitten roaming our yard and the entire neighborhood for around four weeks now. As I mentioned beforehand, we live in a duplex and our front door has a Ring camera, and we have never seen this kitten enter their home or being taken off the premises in their vehicle. Finally, again, as mentioned, this kitten has a terrible eye infection, a belly full of worms, and is skin and bones. 

We are absolutely shocked by this turn of events and do not know what to do. Her little girl often refers to the stray cats and kittens as “hers” and plays with the ones who are tolerant enough of her behavior, but they have never openly claimed any of the outside cats before. Our question is, what do we do? Does she have a legal claim to him? Should we be concerned if the police come knocking on our door? We are absolutely in love with this little kitten, even though it has been such a short amount of time, we are working hard to restore his health and have cried tears tonight wondering if she might be able to take him back.

We know she has not paid the pet deposit or otherwise we would have immediately returned him, even though it would have broken our hearts to put him back outside.",2023-08-29 10:00:45
My new landlord won’t let us get a dog even though all of the other tenants on the property have pets,"I live on a huge piece of property. There are 7 houses on the property that are all rented out. 
My old landlord recently just sold the property to a couple. Me and my partner have been together for well over three years and decided we wanted the commitment of a dog. 

We asked our new landlord for permission and they said no. We are upset because everyone else on the property has dogs and cats and we thought what would be the issue considering everyone else has them. We have lived on the property for a couple of years now.

I understand ultimately they own the property and obviously want to respect their wishes. I’m just upset with them saying no. I think what made it even worse is that she asked about the flooring in our house which in my head why are you asking me? Shouldn’t you know what you just bought?

My cat is licking all the fur off his back legs and tail. He’s licking like it’s his job.,"I have a cat that used to belong to my son who now lives with me. He has always been a very mellow chill cat. The past few months he has been licking and licking and licking. He does not have fleas. I have had him sleep on a white sheet to see if there are any fleas as picking him up to look at his belly is not an option. He hates being picked up.

He also does not have worms. I had a stool tested. 

He is so picky with food now I am at a loss what to feed him. He cries because he’s hungry and when I put food down he looks at it then walks away. I have tried sooooo many different canned foods to find something he will like and eat. He will like it for a day then no more. 

I also changed his dry food to all meat. He had been eating the Science Diet hairball formula cause he was throwing up daily. 

I went to an upscale pet store looking for advise. It was recommended to stop with seafood of any kind and grains as well to see if he had developed an allergy. I also am giving him calming chews. I can’t tell
If they help. 

I have tried a huge variety of cat foods and he will like one for a day then walk away. Until
a few months ago there was never a problem with his food. I don’t know what has changed. He is also loosing weight.",2023-08-29 03:01:38
My cat went missing 4 days ago and I think I came across his remains on my lawn today :( How can I identify them?,"My cat went missing from my house 4 days ago. We've done everything - posted signs around the neighborhood, talked to all the neighbors, filed reports with Animal Control, the animal hospital, and the local shelters. There has been no sign of him. 

This morning, I saw patches of fur on my lawn that match his coat color. I also found three bones which I think could be ribs. This makes me think he was caught and killed by a coyote, which have been spotted in my neighborhood. Is there anything I can do to confirm if these remains do or don't belong to my cat? This whole experience has been quite harrowing and I just want some closure :(

Edit: Please don’t bother lecturing me on why I shouldn’t have let my cat out. He was an indoor cat who escaped. Regardless, no one here is interested in your soapbox lecture on how cat owners who let their cats outdoors are irresponsible and neglectful. Not a single cat owner out there willingly puts their pet’s life in danger. But we often don’t have a choice in the matter. Cats escape. Or are extremely unhappy when kept inside and act out, so owners are forced to let them out for everyone’s sanity. It’s never a black and white situation, so either have some empathy or just close this thread and move on.",2023-08-29 00:06:30
I threw a cringey birthday party for my cats.,"So I was having a pretty depressed rough couple of weeks and just needed something to look forward to. So I planned a birthday party for my cats (about a week of planning). I actually went to the store bought gifts and wrapped them (They love tearing paper up and spent a good amount of time playing with the wrapping paper.. I also put out decorations and bought myself a cake along with a cat cake (Bassically tuna topped with vanilla ice-cream cat treats for sprinkles they loved it). I got them a little party hat and myself a hat. I was saving up empty amazon boxes and made them a box playground (they just hopped around and sat in all of the empty boxes). They had a blast. I was scared to tell any family members or friends about this because it's very cringey. I was the only human at the party, and we'll my 3 cats.

My dog ran away and was found badly injured. What do we do?,"My dog is mini yorkie, almost 10.

Should I adopt the dog?,"Me (30M) and my gf (31F) are on vacation in my family home (Portugal). While on vacation we came across an abandoned puppy, roughly 3 months old. This puppy has been taken care of by an old lady who feeds her and gives her shelter. Problem is that this lady is also on vacation and can't take the puppy with her to her permanent home as the building she lives in doesn't allow pets. My gf and I have posted pics of the puppy on social media and asked around if anyone is interested in adopting her, but to no avail.

So now we have 3 options: 1) leave the dog in the village by herself; 2) take the dog to a shelter; 3) adopt the dog.

Option 3 would normally be a no-brainer, however there are certain variables to take into account as we live in an apartment with 2 adult male cats.

What would you do? We are scared of adopting her as we never had a dog in an apartment, and this addition to our household may not be beneficial to our cats in several ways, however I don't know if I could live with myself knowing that I didn't help this dog in the best way possible.

Thank you in advance.

Edit: We found a lovely home for the puppy! Thank you all for the kind words and help.",2023-08-27 09:55:34

Others say it's basically powdered uranium and if any comes in contact with your cats they're essentially marked for death. Then you have people saying it just doesn't work, is impossible to clean, and the powder personified itself just to say horrible things about their mothers.**

**What's killing me here is not only can I not find an easily verifiable answer, but I also can't even find a simple Youtube video about how people actually use this stuff on carpet and furniture in a pet safe way (Several are out there that just show how to work it in, but I want pet safe methods). Some say one light dusting followed by a few hours out of the house, others say you have to reapply frequently, and more still are saying that if you apply it once you've basically murdered yourself and everything around you.**

So here's my situation, we've found ourselves in a flea-ridden hellscape. Recently we moved to a new rental with myself, my partner, our two cats, leopard gecko, and two tarantulas. Our cats also have an addiction for the outdoors. We don't let them roam however, we just let them on the patio in a secure tent that just allows them to sunbathe and watch the birds, and this occurs usually once every evening. We believe this is how the flea problem started.

Here we are now, still with fleas, and I've come across a potential solution that has worked great for my partner before with bedbugs, that being Diatomaceous Earth. My general understanding is that you basically want a very light dusting of it on everything that the fleas may hide in. **Some people even seem to put it on their animals coats!** That made me confident enough to try it with my cats, until I encountered waves of other people saying that this is akin to homicide.

**SO MANY PEOPLE** say that it's going to cause horrible respiratory issues, but the weird thing is I never find actual stories of this happening. It's like everyone is quoting article after article and the rabbit hole goes on for miles, all the while no one is actually reporting bad experiences. They've all just echoed each others warnings. I've also read that pest control companies run disinformation campaigns on the stuff because it's extremely effective and affordable, which hurts their business. I'm not sure how much I truly buy into that, but it's food for thought none-the-less.

**TLDR and overarching theme:** Has anyone here actually used it for pest control? How did you use it? What were the results? Any breathing problems after it? How much is too much? Why do fleas exist? Do they go to hell when they die?

Any advice is appreciated, and thank you for reading.",2023-08-26 23:59:46
Unleashed Dog Attacked My Yorkie,"My yorkie was attacked by the neighbors unleashed pit bull Tuesday. A police report was made he was fined for not having a permit or insurance for the dog. After the attack he tried to drive away with his dog and take it somewhere but the police met him around the corner and made him turn around. Animal control came and made him surrender the dog. I took my dog to AVS where he had surgery and had to get a drain. He was released Tuesday afternoon. He died Thursday morning. My kids are devastated. My son with ADHD/autism/anxiety that saw the attack is traumatized. All he keeps being up is “the dog fighting Max” 

I’m still trying to process this. He hasn’t come over to apologize or anything. Honestly I don’t want to speak to him because he’s a registered sex offender for molesting a 13 year old child. I don’t know what else to do other than take him to small claims court I guess for vet bills….it was a little under $700. I just don’t know what to do. Max is gone. Is it even worth taking this court? It won’t bring max back.",2023-08-26 08:27:32
Cat won’t stop crying and I don’t know what to do anymore.,"Hi everyone. 

My cat is 12 years old. I’ve had her since she was a little over a year old. She’s either a siamese mix or a ragdoll mix (two different vets had different theories as to what she was lol). She has always been a chatty cat but I feel like it’s gotten worse as she gets older and especially for like, the last 2 years.

A little medical background:

 - She has only been sick once when she was younger, she was throwing up and dehydrated but she ended up fine.
- She has acute arthritis in her back hip.
-  She was overweight around December of last year (13 pounds) because we used to free feed her in order to combat her incessant meowing. Vet told us to take away the gravity feeder and help her lose weight. We got her an automatic feeder.
- Last month (July) she started displaying weirder behaviors: diarrhea outside of her litter box, throwing up, sleeping a lot, and losing weight. Took her to the vet and did bloodwork, xrays, urine. Literally EVERYTHING came back fine. She weighed 9lbs at the appointment.

**Note: In July, we had our floors and carpet done. I was not present during this time but I was told she had to be locked in a room all day as work was done on the house. I feel like this, along with my absence, stressed her the hell out and might’ve triggered this behavior.**

So when I took her for her physical earlier this month, she dropped another pound between her last visit. Vet said the next step would be ultrasounds for her intestines/abdomen. I guess to screen for cancer/masses/thickening of her intestinal walls? That’s what I understood from what the vet explained.

I asked the vet about her thyroids but the vet said they were fine.

But I feel like every single symptom and behavior she has screams hyperthyroidism! Weight loss, incessant meowing and yowling for food! The only thing that hasn’t changed is her energy. She has plenty of energy to cause a ruckus all fucking day because she wants to eat all the time.

We’re trying to get her weight up as the vet instructed us to, so I feed her small meals three times a day. Her breakfast is dry food (tiki cat). Her mid day snack is high calorie so she can start gaining weight. Apparently that’s not enough for my cat because she will start crying for her dinner an hour after. (For reference, snack is at 12, dinner is at 5. She will cry for four hours straight.) Her dinner is Tiki Cat wet food.

I also should mention she has plenty of toys and I’ll give her catnip here and there, and I’m trying to play with her more. Along with being more affectionate because she is an affectionate cat.

I’ve tried correcting her behavior but y’all she is a senior cat. She does not GAF.

I want to get a second opinion. What do you guys think? Am I doing something wrong with her food? Should I take her to another vet?",2023-08-26 04:22:55
"My cat suddenly starts to drink again, 2hours before we wanted to put her down","UPDATE: the vet came by and we decided to wait. We don't know if he is going to recover or if it may worsen in a day or two. But we are happy that we can spend at least a bit more time with him. Thanks to everyone who commented! I couldn't be happier to cuddle him for another night.

My cat's health has decreased over the last week rapidly. He is 13 years old and is sick for a year. (whenever he stopped eating, etc. we went to vent and got medication, which helped him to get better). he has stopped eating for days now and has not been drinking for 2 days. (the condition was never that severe)He is also very wobbly on his feet and sometimes does not manage to jump up the furniture. He lies around a lot and sometimes seems apathetic. Nevertheless, he comes again and again to be stroked and then purrs. He also continues to clean himself. However, since he lost a lot of weight and the vet said he was coming to the end of his life, we made an appointment for tonight to have him put to sleep. (for the last months or so, we went to vent more often)We love him more than anything, but do not want him to suffer. It looked the last days strongly that he has arrived at the end of his life. Today he suddenly started drinking again and ate for the first time (at least a bit). We are totally surprised and do not know what to do. Should we wait another few days? Any tips?",2023-08-24 23:51:32
Does dry kibble make your cat sick?,I saw a tikTok of this lady saying regular dry kibble will give your cat bladder issues and shorten their life span. Should I be adding water to my cat's kibble? We rescued him as an overweight boy so we refrained from wet food till we got his weight under control per the advice of the rescue people who gave him to us. ,2023-08-24 19:13:30
indoor cat mysteriously disappeared,"UPDATE #2: thought i would make one last update on this post to let everyone know that Max has been found, and sadly he was hit by a car on a busy road outside of our neighborhood. i got a call and a text from neighbors who saw our flyers and reported a cat in the road outside of our housing community. we had driven to a shelter to give them a flyer in case anyone brought him in. on the way back we checked, and it was my sweet boy. the hardest part is that he wasn’t even there an hour earlier when we had left, which means we could’ve seen him and brought him home. i feel like an awful cat mom and like i’ve done everything wrong here. i already miss my baby so much, and i know his siblings will miss him too. i’ve decided to get him cremated so that he can always be with us and his siblings. we live in a rental house where i have lost 3 pets now, so i refuse to bury him here because i hate this house and will not leave him when we eventually move. i want to thank everyone again for all the kind comments and support, it meant the world to me. i really did try my hardest to find him, and it really really really hurts my heart that this is the result of my story. Max was a beautiful, sweet, fun, adventurous baby and my heart will miss him forever. i wish i could show you all a picture of him, maybe i’ll make a separate post to show you all what a beautiful baby he was. may my sweet angel rest in peace ❤️‍🩹

UPDATE: it’s been another day, still no sign of my sweet baby Max anywhere. i’ve checked everywhere i have access to, at least 4 times, within the past 2 days. i’ve looked under and inside couches, drawers, cabinets, box springs, beds, closets, under the hoods of our cars, etc. we live in a newer house, built in 2019 i believe. the house is also a rental, so there isn’t any holes in the floor, walls, ceilings, or anywhere else that he could crawl up into the walls or ceiling from. we live in florida, so no basements, and i don’t even think we have access to our attic. our ac vents are closed, and our oven and dishwasher have absolutely no gaps beside or behind them. our refrigerator has maybe an inch of space between the back of it and the wall. i want to emphasize how vocal he is, and i strongly believe that if he was here hiding somewhere and could hear me, he would be meowing whenever i call his name. him and his siblings don’t like cat treats for some reason, so i haven’t been shaking those, but instead have used goldfish, cheese, and his dry kibble to lure him out (he runs up to me any time i eat goldfish or cheese to try and get a bite.) i’m starting to believe that he is either trapped and deceased in the house somewhere, or he did in fact escape and will hopefully come back at some point. i walk up and down my street with food and call his name every night, to no avail. i’m trying to remain hopeful but it’s really hard in this scenario. i’m still really scared that something awful has happened to him. i have called shelters and the ones that answered have not taken in any cats in weeks. i’ll be driving to them tomorrow and giving them flyers with his face and our numbers on them, just in case. i’ll also make another post on the facebook group for my community, next door, the ring app, and anything else i can think of. i’ll probably add a reward for someone if they can find him, i’m extremely desperate at this point. not to be morbid, but i’m really afraid that he has passed away in the house somewhere, and am wondering that if this is the case, at what point would i start to smell it? i know this would be really traumatic and kind of want to prepare myself in case that’s what’s happening. i still have the litter box and food trap set up, i’m also probably going to pin one of my worn shirts out there like some of you suggested. i really feel like i’ve done everything i possibly can, and at this point am just asking for thoughts, prayers, positive vibes, anything i can take to bring him home. if anyone has any other suggestions, again, please let me know! i will do everything i can to try and find him. thank you all for the positive messages and advice, it has been as reassuring as i hoped it would be. coming to reddit always makes me feel better, because i know there are other people who have been in my shoes. ❤️‍🩹

hello all! i’m extremely scared and worried right now, as my indoor cat has seemingly vanished into thin air. this morning i realized i hadn’t seen him in a little while, i slept most of the day yesterday, and when i did wake up i immediately started getting ready for an event. as i was rushing around, i can’t recall if i saw him around the house (i have 7 cats, and sometimes my memory is foggy.) the last time i am CERTAIN i saw him was the night before last, as i was petting him and hanging out while i baked cookies. the rest of my family can’t remember if they saw him yesterday at all, either. he is about 4 and a 1/2 years old now and i have had him and all of his siblings since they were literally fetuses - they were born in my room. my mom and i have absolutely TORN the house apart, looking anywhere you can imagine. we’ve checked in the garage, freezers, cabinets, under the couch, behind the entertainment center, closets, under beds, EVERYWHERE! i thought maybe he could have been sick and craving isolation, but i’ve looked anywhere i could think of and considered every hiding spot in the book, and still could not find him. we never keep windows open, our ac vents are still intact, there is no entry to our attic, there is no way to get behind our appliances or anything. we decided that he must’ve gotten out somehow, but we usually don’t leave doors open and he usually doesn’t run out if we do, and nobody in my household recalls seeing him escape. he likes to explore but has never left the porch or run away like that. i’ve posted on next door, the ring app, facebook communities, anything i can think of, as well as putting up posters around the neighborhood that have his face on them. him and his siblings are all very vocal and love to meow when i call their names, but we haven’t heard anything. we’ve walked around our house, all around the backyard, and up and down our street calling his name and have gotten nothing. i’ve put his litter box and a bowl of food out for him, and set up one of our blink cameras so that if he comes for either of those things he will trigger the camera and notify me. i’ve had him since he was born and my animals mean everything to me, this is extremely heartbreaking and i’m so so scared and worried. i just want to know if there’s anything else i should do? i’m starting to lose hope and i’m scared he’s gone for good, whether he’s lost or deceased. i’ve been absolutely torn up over this all day, i feel like a terrible pet owner because i’m not even sure when he disappeared. if anyone has advice on anything else i could do, please comment. i just want my baby back home </3",2023-08-24 15:10:44
I hit a puppy,"*trigger warning* 

At 6am this morning I hit a puppy that jumped out in front of my car on a busy highway. I was beside myself. I slammed my brakes and pulled over as soon as I could comprehend what had happened. I was devastated, crying hysterically, running down the side of the road with my flashlight on searching for him so I could pull him off the side of the road. I don’t know how far up the road he was when I pulled over. After about a minute or so searching, cars speeding down the road, I couldn’t find him so I ran back to my car, tears streaming down my face. If you had seen me during the day, you would have thought something was seriously wrong with me the way I was crying. I called my parents, in hysterics, my hands shaking violently. I kept going to work. I left him there. 

I’ve had two pets get hit by cars and all I can think about is how violently they died, how violently he died, if he did. I’m sure he had to, my front bumper is all messed up. There is no blood but I’m sure he didn’t die painlessly. And I know this is going to keep me up at night. 

I just need some comfort in the knowledge that there was nothing I could have done to stop it. He ran in front of me, I had no time to react. I know this in my head, but I don’t know if my brain comprehends it. I’m at work now and I haven’t stopped thinking about it. About how he dropped when I looked in the rear view mirror afterwards. I feel like vomiting. Somebody please comfort me.

Edit 2: The dog passed on impact most likely. I don’t think he was a puppy but really just a small dog. Some kind soul moved him to the side of the road while I was at work yesterday. That, or he was able to walk afterwards and moved off the road where he passed, which would explain why I couldn’t find him. I saw him this morning and my dad is going back tonight to put him in a box so we can bury him properly at home with flowers. I still feel so sick about the whole thing and immediately burst into tears when I saw him this morning. I’m glad he passed relatively quickly and I’m thankful he managed to get off the road somehow so that I can give him the burial he deserves.

My coworkers took me out to drink and play arcade games after work to help me feel better. It helped a lot and so did some of these comments. Thank you to everyone who helped cheer me up <3",2023-08-23 19:07:25
"Why does my cat do this? (Harmless behavior, just curious if there's a reason for it))","i have a cat (11, male, fixed, entirely indoor) who i've had since he was a kitten and he's been doing this as long as i can remember. 

when i go to bed, i give him some treats and get in bed. he leaves my room, goes into the living room and picks up a toy (always the same one -- he used to do it with any of his toys but lately it has been the same one every time), and he meows loudly while he carries it around for about 5 minutes. eventually, he drops it on the ground (always in/around the same part of the living room) and comes in to bed. 

if i call his name or come see what he's doing, he stops and he doesn't do it any other time. i know what he's doing because i've snuck out and watched him do it and the toy is always in the same area then next morning after i move it or he plays with it throughout the day.

obviously it doesn't really matter and i don't need him to stop doing it or anything, i think it's funny. i'm just curious what he's doing.",2023-08-23 15:33:55
What just happened to my cat? Should I worry?,"My cat was facing away from me and started making some noise, I thought that she was just licking herself while growling because that’s what it sounded like and from behind she was doing that motion.

I called her name and she turned to face me with her mouth wide open. She was slowly lifting her paw up but her face and the rest of her body seemed frozen in place. It lasted for only a few seconds as I ran over to her in a panic and the minute I held her she was normal again. 

Tried looking it up but not sure what it could be, safe to say my chest is still so tight that it hurts and real breathless right now.

UPDATE: Hey guys. So I’ve taken a look at both saddle thrombus and Flehman’s response. It looked nothing like any of those to me. Also I guess I wasn’t all that clear but she wasn’t actually licking herself, I just thought for a second maybe that’s what she was doing. She also doesn’t growl if it’s just us in the house, only when my partner is around and they weren’t. To me it kind of looked like a stroke, unhinged jaw, frozen in place, very very slowly lifting her paw up by the side of her face. I don’t know, maybe I’m wrong. I’ve never witnessed her cough up a hairball around me so I thought maybe she was choking on something and just froze from it? Anyway, I’m going to take her to the vet. Thanks for the help.",2023-08-23 04:27:08
That time my dog made us call the vet over nothing,"I had just finished eating dinner with my family when our dog started whining at the treat cupboard. Normally just after we finish eating dinner she gets a bonio if she's been good, so, because she'd stayed quiet and behaved well while we were eating (a rare occasion) I gave her one. She gently took it out of my hand and ran into the living room to eat it on her usual spot on the sofa.

Normally she's weird and won't eat it until someone comes and sits down beside her so once the table was cleared I went to check on her. For once she'd mustered up the courage to eat her bonio all by herself and was hoovering up the crumbs. When she'd finished I gave her a chin scratch and noticed a lump on the left side of her jaw. At first I thought that maybe she'd chewed her bonio a bit too enthusiastically and dislocated her jaw but if she was in pain she would be crying and wouldn't let me touch the area. 

I called my dad over and he looked inside her mouth. He could see a lump on the inside too. We quickly called the vet and they gave us an appointment for just under an hours time despite the fact they were very busy. The vet who answered suggested that she'd maybe eaten a bee or a wasp which wouldn't be too surprising for our dog. She was biting the air in discomfort so we figured that was probably what happened. We took it in turns to comfort her before it was time to go. We got her harness on, collected a blanket and her doggy seat belt and were about to leave the house when she began to gag. We braced ourselves for her to throw up but instead out pops a chunk of bonio. It had been caught in her cheek and the lump was now gone. 

We then had to phone the vet to explain that it was a false alarm which was rather embarrassing as the dog smiled up at us like she'd not just caused the whole family to worry for an hour and wasted the vets time. At least we didn't make the discovery while the vet was looking at her. That would've been an expensive treat 🙃",2023-08-23 03:41:16
How often do you clean the house with a very fluffy cat?,"My SO lives a 3 bedroom condo (litter Box is in one room), which is ok clean otherwise but there is a straight up sheet of cat hair on everything, the sofa, the carpets, bed, clothes, towels. I think it’s really gross coming from a non pet household. What is normal/expected?  In my mind I’m thinking the cat should be brushed everyday and things vacuumed 1-2 times a week and the sheets washed every 1-2 weeks minimum. The cat shouldn’t be let in the closet to get the clothes/towels get covered. Is this overboard? I have no idea what to suggest but it’s making me not want to go over there, but I’m running out of reasons and don’t know how to say “your hairy house grosses me out” without having some suggestions or realistic expectations. I think SO only vacuums every 3-4 weeks and brushes the cat randomly like maybe once every two weeks.",2023-08-22 20:51:43
Grieving,"I've never lost a pet before or had to deal with the grieving process. I had a cat for 2 years and got used to doing everything with him. When I showered, Spade (the cat) was there. When I was on my computer playing games,  Spade was on my lap or on the floor right beside me. It never mattered what I was doing, he found a way to be there with me. At the end of last month, I had to put him down because his insides were leaking inside of him. Putting him to sleep was one of the hardest days of my life. I'm not an emotional person but I cried for a week straight, the week after that I was just extremely grumpy and angry with the world. I lost a lot of direction in my life. It took me three weeks to remember what it's like to have hope. Been enjoying my hobbies again lately. Feels good. My sleep has been horrible. Lucky to get a few hours of sleep each night until recently, I finally started sleeping. I guess that's when I started enjoying hobbies and life again. Until the other night I had a nightmare about Spade. The nightmare started with me having a happy life with him, and it ending in going to the vet and having to put him down. Except the nightmare kept looping. It wouldn't end. And now I just feel so depressed all over again. I feel like all the progress I thought I was making was crushed. I guess my question is, is this normal??? How long do people typically grieve? What can I do to help myself? Why won't this pain go away? How do I express my emotions to people who don't understand? I hear , ""it's just a cat"" a lot. I'm a very optimistic and happy person, it's how I've functioned my entire life. And now it's so hard to be. I shouldn't be this depressed over a cat I would think. But I am. Every day is so difficult and whenever I feel a little better again I get crushed. It is so tiring trying to be happy.",2023-08-22 01:08:22
Cat adoption regret - need advice and support,"Hello. I adopted a one year old female a couple of days ago and I failed to realize how active, playful and how much energy she has. I take full responsibility that I didn't realize that part. I wanted a more independent, laid back, chill cat, which now I am realizing an older one would be a better fit. I am at work all day and cannot play with her or give her attention for most of the day.

I am planning on giving it another week to see if she ends up adjusting to my lifestyle or calming down. But, am I a terrible person for feeling this way? For returning her back after just a week? She is young, so I know she will find a loving home SO quick, and I want that for her. I just don't have the mental capacity or emotional stability to give her what she might need.

Please, I would appreciate your kindness. I feel awful about making a rash decision and not doing my research on young cats, but I just want to hear some thoughts about how I should know if she really is a wrong fit, and if returning her that soon is cruel. I don't want her to be in an unfit household for too long, she is the sweetest and deserves a home that can give her what she needs; energy. And I know she will be snatched right up.

Thank you in advance. And once again, please be kind. This is not an easy time for me right now.

UPDATE: I decided to surrender her back to the shelter, and it was the best choice for both of us. In good news, I dropped her off this morning and she's already adopted again! Thank you all again for your advice and words and I just hope she's thriving in her new home :)",2023-08-22 00:34:47
Should I call animal control if I think some kitten are not being taken care of?,"So we have these neighbors who are just weird. They leave at all hours of the day, have a mix of different races of kids of all ages (which is fine it there is only 1 adult and maybe 4 kids or more), I’ve never seen them take their trash out (like to the curb for pick up) and one of the kids yelled at me asking me what I was looking at when I was outside doing nothing. I wasn’t even looking at her at all! 

Anyways to the pets, they have 2 small kittens, and I’ve seen them outside and inside. And whenever they are outside I always just say hi and go on with my day, they don’t come over or anything. Well yesterday they were outside so of course I say “hi kitty” and they both ran over to me and were meowing. It was the first time I saw them up close snd I noticed how skinny they were. And my poor heart couldn’t handle it so I gave them both tuna. They ran to me like they had never been feed! And the one who was the shyest (wouldn’t get close to me at first) come running up to me for pets and loves.

I keep an close eye on them until I saw that the neighbors returned. I picked them both up (after they were done eating and walked them back to the neighbors. The boy didn’t make eye contact with me at all and grab the kittens, the shy one tried to climb back into my shoulder as if trying to run away. 

I’ve been thinking about this all day and it been killing me. But I don’t have proof that those kittens are in danger or not and I don’t want to put my family on the spot light if they try and come after us (I have two small kids and my husband works a lot so it’s just us)  because I called AC on them. I don’t know what to do.



Edit: One I’m sorry if my wording for the mix race sounded rude. I just meant she might be Forstering because of the all the different ages and race which that’s fine as long as the kids are safe. 

Two: I haven’t seen the kittens but now there are two different kittens that come outside, both look healthy then the other ones and I heard they were also from said neighbor but not 100% sure I’ve only seen the first ones so those worried about a million cats in my neighborhood then it’s already happening 😂 but thank you everyone for the advice! I appreciate it",2023-08-21 22:59:30
Lost my newly adopted 4 year old cat,"As stated in the title, I adopted yesterday a sweet 4 year old cat (from a family that couldn’t keep him because their son declared allergies). The trip home went as expected, he was meowing, and quite stressed. When we arrived at home, I confined all the spaces in my house except for the living room and the kitchen. 

He was very friendly and went on to explore and even hid behind the couch. But then he went upstairs and managed to go into one of the bedroom. He was hidden behind some furniture but still responding to his name. So I decided to leave him be, and to give him space. 

But when I came back to the room (about 30 min later) just to check. He was gone. After inspection, there was a small hole in the wall, for cables. As this area is quite remote, we did not see this hole before. This hole leads to some attic that we cannot access. 

We heard him in the evening, running. I put some water near the hole and a toy. But since then, nothing. The litter hasn’t been used, and the water seems untouched. I tried to check if he was still in there but I heard just tiny noises. I put some tuna earlier this afternoon. 

I am starting to get really worried, as I’ve never had a cat before. I read that this type of behavior is normal for a distressed cat as he doesn’t know his new home. But I am really worried because it is a bit hot in the house and he could be stuck somewhere. 

I am sorry for the long text, but does anyone has any advice on what I could do ? I was really happy to welcome him home, but now I’m a ball of stress ! 

Thank you 🥹",2023-08-21 00:59:04
Pet names for your pets,Okay we all know it: our pets have several unofficial “pet names” that are a play on their names or are just plain silly or ridiculous. What are your pet names for your pet?,2023-08-20 22:50:38
update; My mom is overfeeding my dog and won't listen to what I say,"Wow, wasn't expecting that last post to get the attention it did. All of your responses have been so helpful, but I am unable to do most of them due to me living in the suburbs. No access to a car, and can't buy anything online.

A suggestion I found really helpful was mixing steamed vegetables with my dog's food instead of whatever we have been eating.

I checked the fridge for vegetables, and we had none. I went to my mother, asking for some, and she berated me emotionally. Yelling why i was ""criticizing her"" and how i had ""no right to judge her."" I wasn't even judging her, we just only had fruit and junk food in the house and I wanted vegetables.

I asked her if we could get some next time we went shopping, and she went on a whole spiel about how I can't say I just want ""vegetables."" but I have to be more \*specific\*. Whatever That means. So I listed off the veggies I knew that Lola could eat. and left, thinking that was the end of it.

We went shopping later that day, and when parents came back all they had was the necessary veggies burgers  that my pescetarian sister needs to eat. I asked about veggies, and Mom said that i wasn't ""specific enough' and she couldn't buy ""just vegetables.?

After another incident that just isn't entirely related with my mom picking a fight with literally everyone in the house, we ended up going out to eat.  I tried to order some steamed veggies so that I could save some for Lola and see how she reacted to them, but I also just wanted to order steamed veggies.

Mom went ""Booorinngg"" and went on a tangent about how she ""knew my tastes"" and how I wouldn't like the veggies. I just wanted some for my dog.

Oh, not to mention, before we left, I realized that dog would miss her usual feeding time. I asked Mom about it, and she threw a bone with some of those unhealthy meat-wrapped bones into my room, where we put the dog when we left.

I told her we couldn't do that, since dogs need to follow a specific diet and that those bones, which are meant as snacks, aren't sustainable meals. Mom practically GROWLED at me and told me to ""NEVER question the dog's diet.""

So, that's that.

Also, I pretty badly hurt my foot yesterday and I can't take Lola on her walks. I have been trying to be stricter with her walks, but I'm not sure if anybody will take my place.

I also used that scale-trick another redditor recommended on Lola. She is 20 pounds. My mom didn't even know how much she weighed. She was around 23 before we left for Turkey. Keep in mind she is a Coton de Tulear; I am almost positive she is overweight 

I have been doing my own research. I can probably contact that dog-sitter for ideas.",2023-08-20 20:06:12
Question for this who've lost a Pet,"I never have and currently my cat us experiencing some health issues.

It got me thinking about what i am going to do when the inevitable happens...

I don't mean as in putting my pets down. Did you guys bury your pet? Keep their ashes? 

Is there an option to make their remains into something you can hold onto forever like a necklace?

It makes me incredible sad to think of never seeing or holding any of my pets ever again and want something to take with me when I die too...",2023-08-20 14:28:21
The scariest shit happened just now,"I was letting my ball python explore the room while he was out of his enclosure, and I noticed that he was getting a little too close to the space behind the bookshelf.

I went to pick him up and put him down somewhere else, but this little mf had his ass set on going under the bookshelf and getting lost. I kept a hold of him but he was already turned around a corner and under it so I couldn't get him out without hurting him.

Luckily there's a little opening on the front of the bookshelf so I reached under there and pulled him through, I was so scared that he had hurt himself and at this point I was crying and trying to check him for scratches, but he looked okay, he wasn't even scared or anything just happily slithering around on my arm, completely calm and flicking his tongue at me.

Are cats likely to interbreed?,"So I’ve recently adopted 3 stray kittens, 2 girls and a boy all siblings.

My mom is forcing my dog to overeat and won't listen to what I say,"Hi, 15F, sophomore w/ ADHD. Medicated, and the meds are monitored by my Psychiatrist semi-monthly. That might not seem important, but it is.

I have a Coton de Tulear. When summer started, she was 6 pounds overweight. That is more than 25% of her supposed bodyweight. She's a scruffy little thing that I ever so creatively named ""Lola"" when I was nine. Love her to pieces.

I struggled a lot with taking care of her before summer. My ADHD made it so that I had extreme difficulty with switching gears and taking her out when needed. Sometimes, I would be so absorbed in a task (any task, really) I would forget to tend to her most basic needs.

However, I knew that we were overfeeding our little Lola. When Lola came to us from her breeder, she took an immediate liking to human food. She refused to eat any of her dog food unless it had human food (with our scent on it) sprinkled on top and mixed in.

This escalated to her sometimes having entire hot dogs (This is a tiny dog!!! a hot dog is a pretty good meal for an adult HUMAN, not an itty bitty Coton) and various other meaty foods. I would often try and sprinkle cheese in her food instead of literal steak, so that she would eat her dog food. More often than not, it worked.

But whenever I did that, my mother would scream at me for ""being lazy and purposefully underfeeding her."" I have had a bad tendency my whole life to do tasks halfway, because I'll often lose focus mid-way through.

There have probably been dozens of occasions I can recall where I have to cut up some steak for my tiny little doggie through tear-soaked eyes while being screamed at by my mother.

But this wasn't something I was doing halfway through. I was doing this because I knew my dog was overweight. My mother couldn't distinguish between the two however, despite my various attempts to explain it to her.

I am a pretty well-rounded child, but my home habits are my one huge shortcoming. I used to forget to walk her because I was too absorbed in whatever I was doing. It is something I am terribly ashamed of.

Lola also had a terrible bone-eating habit we all used to indulge in. The bones she eats are wrapped in a little meat thingy. She smokes through a 12-pack in a matter of a few days like a hardcore alcoholic. I also tried to stave her off of them, but my Mother called it ""cruel"" and would make me give it to her.

But right before we left for our family vacation this summer, we went to the vet and found that Lola was horrifically overweight. The vet said it was due to her human-food diet.

My entire family visits Turkey every year (except for 2020-2022, ofc) . My Turkish family is extremely old-fashioned and HATES all dogs with a passion because of cultural reasons. My immigrant father works himself to the bone 24/7, and the one thing he asks for all year is to visit his Turkish family.

(i'm going into detail about this so nobody accuses me of not loving my dog by leaving her overseas for two months.

While before my grandparents had taken care to Lola, they were unable to this year because they had gotten a Coton of their own. We left her with an old Spanish teacher who was infamous for treating the dogs she babysat with the utmost care and affection.

Horrified at the news that our dog was ACTUALLY overweight, I explained to my mother that Lola needed to go cold-turkey on her bones. They were actually going to kill her. I tried to use the analogy of cigarettes. If a hardcore smoker wants to stop his addiction, he should go cold-turkey. No ""just one for the holidays,"" Nothing.

My mom and I devised a plan to completely stave Lola off of her bones and her human-food riddled diet. We got near-daily updates from the dog sitter while in Turkey, and Lola was perfectly content. She was reluctant to eat her dog food without any human food, but over time the dog sitter and us worked out a perfect mix for Lola that she ate and enjoyed.

While in Turkey, I did a lot of soul-searching and found a way to counter my issues. I also had my medication halved. Now, I got sucked into things much less and was able to change tasks much easier.  I was also more aware of my body, and the people around me.

When my family reunited with Lola a few days ago, I was overjoyed in my newfound ability to care for her. I started going on runs with her, and overall just enjoyed her presence more, and fulfilled my job better as her primary caretaker.

Lola also lost all the weight she gained. Our plan had worked, and she was healthy again!  I was overjoyed by this, and super proud of both myself and Lola. Since coming back from Turkey, I've had major changes to my diet and physical activity levels. Overall, I am a much more level-headed and happy person.

Lola stopped begging at the table, and was eating ALL of her dog food pretty consistently, with the special mix on top. She rarely ate all of her food, even when there was human food on it.

I was super excited that Lola and I were reunited when we had both undergone our own journeys. But, imagine my confusion when my mom ordered we switch back to Lola's old eating habits. Today, I had to cut up two whole slices of bacon to mix in with her dog food. A few days before, she was eating her dog food just fine.

Of course, now that she was back home she expected things to shift to how they were, so she was a little bit reluctant in eating. But she was still eating her dog food way more than she had in YEARS. Now, we are back to giving her human food almsot daily. i tried to bring it up to my mother a few hours ago, and she snapped at me.

""You're too lazy to even take her out, I don't want to hear any criticism from you."" I have had no qualms about taking her out since we have gotten home (and since I've had my medication halved!) and I have remembered just about everything I used to forget. Aside from a single mishap where my medication hadn't kicked in yet and she peed on the floor, I have been making a huge effort to help my dog.

I thought we had made so much progress, but now my mother is back to feeding her cuts of everything we eat. She begs at the table again, and won't eat her dog food. it took MONTHS to get her to eat her dog food. I'm so upset right now.

There was another incident where my mother forced me to eat food I knew was unhealthy for me because I had eaten a snack earlier. She cooked something I knew was super unhealthy for my body, and I asked her if I could fix myself something so that she wouldn't have to cook a whole new meal. (I Have been very vocal about my refusal to eat this food, and my mother even agreed that it was unhealthy and she would stop eating it as well. For gods sake, she said she was becoming a pescetarian because she ate this food so consistently and it was so bad for her body. )

Instead, she yelled at me and screamed that I had no right to criticize her when I had eaten twizzlers earlier.

I had eaten twizzlers earlier because they were illegal in Turkey, so I hadn't had any in two and a half months. They're my favorite snack, and i was indulging myself with the knowledge that I would be exercising later for two hours. I was also getting my braces soon, so this would be the last time I would be allowed to have them.

I'm just ranting at this point. I'm so upset. My dog is going to die. or something. She's going to be overweight and die. I'm trying to go on runs with her to help her but she is literally going to die.

whenever I try and bring up this issue to my mother, and concerns I have about Lola, she shuts me down and says that this topic is a ""trigger"" for her. It's a trigger to talk about your dog's health???

I'm just actually fuming right now. I am not a perfect person, I am not at all. But I am trying to communicate with my mother about this issue and she is shutting me down. I feel like I am just being dramatic. Maybe this is my laziness shining through. The only person i've talked to about this is my mother, and she says I'm lazy. I don't know. I need outside opinions. Please

edit; Just came back from a pretty good speedwalk with her. She's pretty out of shape. Since changing her diet isn't an option, I'm going to try to exercise with her more. Any recommendations for routines that don't involve any dietary changes?",2023-08-19 22:06:32
Crystals in cat urine,"As the title states, my cat has crystals in her urine. She occasionally urinates on our dog beds, and recently it has been more frequent than usual. The past 2 times she has done it, once the urine soaks through the dog beds small crystals are leftover on the fabric. The crystals are shiny and are about the size of finely ground salt. I am planning on taking her to the vet but will not be able to until Wednesday. I read online that there are urinary care cat foods, some requiring a prescription and some not. My question is, would it be safe to buy one of these non-prescription foods without knowing which type of crystals she has? I read that some form easier in acidic, and some easier in alkaline. It seems most ""urinary"" cat foods lean toward making your cats urine more acidic. Until I can get her into the vet, I don't want to potentially make things worse but I want to do something for her. Should I just play it safe and get her ""normal"" wet food in the meantime? ",2023-08-19 15:04:36
Please check how much you’re actually feeding your pet if they’re overweight.,"I have a golden retriever, and unfortunately she had some major weight gain. Unsure of where it came from as she ate normally with a regular amount of treats and very little human food. She went on good walks with me daily, spanning anywhere between 30-45 mins in the AM/PM and going to the dog park 3x a week. 

My vet kept encouraging more and more exercise so I kicked it up a notch with more dog park visits but nothing was helping, so my dog was switched to a weight loss food with only 1 cup per day (AM/PM) totaling 2 cups.

After 4 months, there was only 1 pound lost. I was getting so worried because nothing was working and my dog is now 7 1/2. I had to spend so much money getting her thyroid checked and the vet encouraged me to start feeding her less. 

I come home, and I go to feed my Dog and I really analyze the food scooper I have. This food scooper came from a Pet store and was marked with a “1 cup” line. To make sure, I went and grabbed one of my food measuring spoons and sure enough the 1 cup that I usually use for baking, when pouring into her regular scooper I’ve been using for YEARS could fit two scoops. 

To say that easily, 1 cup that came from my kitchen, could fit 2 cups into her standard scooper that I’ve been using for years. 

I have been over feeding my dog for several years and resulted into her weight gain. 

Now that she has been on a REAL 1 cup, my dog lost 9 pounds in a month and a half and I can see a drastic change in her behavior and endurance. 

Please double check how much you’re really feeding your animals!",2023-08-19 01:44:23

"Cat has been lethargic for 5 days, vet cannot figure out why","My lady cat is 13 months old. She is usually active, playful and clingy. She loves eating.

Since Sunday afternoon, she has become tired, sleepy, not respond to us and reduced appetite.

Took her to vet yesterday all vitals were good and went home.  When she went out of carrier she vomited. However, later on in the evening she was active, playful and clingy again. Everything seems going to right direction.

&#x200B;

However, this morning, she vomited again, I took her to hospital immediately. Vet again said vitals all okay, done some blood test(which did not test for red/white blood cell), found nothing wrong.  She was very active at the hospital anyway. Got discharged and went home with some probiotics.

As soon as she arrived home, she has become super tired, sleppy, doing nothing but just lying down to sleep, dont even bother to eat....

Results of blood test and her vomits in the comments sections.  Appreciate any advice. Thanks.

Updated 18/8: took her to clinic today because hospital didn’t want us to bring her in. 

Anyway vet at clinic found out she was in fever, will do blood test for red/white blood cells and ultrasound to rule out fip. Finger crossed nothing serious.

Really thank you guys for advice.",2023-08-17 23:08:05
"Wife (mistakenly, had no idea) gave cat broth from a soup with heavy onions/garlic. What should we be on the lookout for in the next 24-hours or 48-hours to recognize when to take him into the vet?","Hi all.

My wife gave a small amount of broth (probably a teaspoon-tablespoon) of broth to the cats to lick up from their bowls. One of the cats lapped it up quickly the other did not, before I remembered and looked up online to see that garlic/onions are bad.

There were about 3-4 small diced piece sof onion in both bowls that the cats didn't touch, so I imagine if there was  any extra they probably ate them. She thinks she only put broth in though. 

I think the cats are going to be fine, it seemed like a very small amount, but what do I need to be on the lookout for in the next 24-48 hours in relation to this potential poisoning? No vets are open over the weekend here and I want to make sure I get in if the right symptoms persist.

Curious about what pets can be an alternative and similar to cats ?,"Hi, maybe not a very interesting question, or maybe it has already been asked a lot of times. But I'm curious about real alternatives to cats that exists, and maybe there are none and it's fine. To better explain myself, I mean an animal with mild to low maintenance required but if it's higher it can fit, but also an animal that you can let roam freely in your house. I'm interested about guinea pigs for example, but they seem hard to care and it seems you cannot really let them do their life in your house/room (maybe I'm wrong ?) I've seen people talking about rats but I'm not sure you can let them do their thing where you have cables or toxic things or heavy things that could crush them. If the answer is nothing it's fine. Just curious about that. 
Thanks in advance for your answers. Have a nice day :)

Edit : I guess my side question is also that i'm very interested in guinea pigs, are guinea pigs happy even if they are enclosed pretty most of the time too? And maybe what can I expect from having guinea pigs in term of roaming and maintenance.",2023-08-16 20:32:05
Can someone like me (who doesn’t love animals) have a pet?,"I am not an animal person and never have been. I’ve never been able to bond with or love an animal.

My spouse wants a pet, perhaps a small dog of a calmer breed, and it would mean a lot to me to see him enjoy animal companionship. We’ve been together nearly 10 years, pet free. He pretends he doesn’t want a pet so I can live comfortably, but I feel like it’s his turn to have a pet since he’s compromised for me all these years.

He tells me he is fine never to have a pet, but I do not want to rob him of the joys of animal companionship. I may not understand people who love their animals, but I can visibly see the value and happiness it brings them.

I would like to learn to be compassionate and patient with an animal even if there is a chance I will never love it. I would like to be a team with my partner to raise something together. We have no kids. I am aware of the commitment it requires to raise an animal. My siblings live with us upstairs, they have two cats, and I’ve learned to adapt. Can someone like me successfully raise a pet, or am I just being delusional?

Edit: I just wanted to sincerely thank everyone for their support and encouragement. I wasn’t expecting to get so many comments or so much support. I am very grateful to everyone who took their time to share their experiences and advice with me. I probably won’t be able to get to every comment but please know I truly appreciate everyone’s advice and feedback, and on a side note, we will probably not be getting a jack russell lol. If we do get a pet, I look forward to becoming a great pet owner and working through the challenges with my partner. Thanks everyone!",2023-08-16 17:44:03
My family doesn’t understand why I adore my cat,"(TW for suicidal tendencies & mental health issues.)


I have severe Bipolar disorder, and my manic episodes tend to be lengthy and very catastrophic. I’m often labeled a “flight risk” by my family and tend to make pretty drastic choices. My depressive episodes are shorter, but just as extreme, and I’m no stranger to suicidal tendencies. However, the one thing that has always helped me, perhaps even more than medicine, is animals. 

I love animals, probably more than anything else. I’ve had a few pets over the course of my life, and they’ve all helped curb my suicidal thoughts in one way or the other. Pets have always been a purpose for me, a reason not to end everything or try to run away, because I had something depending on me. Unfortunately, pets don’t live forever, and so eventually I had to say goodbye to all of my fuzzy friends from childhood. I didn’t have another pet for a while, because my mom isn’t fond of animals. 

But right before college, my therapist suggested an ESA (Emotional Support Animal). I know everybody has their opinions on them, and I’m of the majority that understand that they need to be separate from service animals and obviously proper guidelines need to be followed, but that they do have their uses. I just didn’t realize how useful they were until I adopted my cat Schroeder. 

When I first met him, Schroeder was a little 3 month old tuxedo kitten, with only a little bit of white on his paws and chest. He was so shy, ignoring everybody who passed him until I came up to his cage, and he began pressing himself against the bars so I could pet him. I could feel him purring, and immediately, I knew he was my baby. I adopted him as soon as their adoption hours opened, and named him after the Peanuts character, because I’m also a pianist, and piano is another therapeutic practice for me. I filled out the ESA paperwork and brought him to school with me. 

I know dorm life isn’t for cats, so I invested in a cat harness, cat stroller, leash training, a cat hammock for the wall, and a little comfortable bag to carry him to outdoor restaurants to. I got off my classes at 12, so I was able to go outside with him a lot. Everybody adored him. I swear, he’s a saint among cats. He doesn’t tear things up, is talkative, and is so easy to train. I didn’t even know you could train cats, but his list of tricks are:

- Sit
- Rest
- Dance
- Sing/Chat
- Shake
- Fetch
- Come

It took a lot of practice and patience on both of our ends, but he’s such a good cat. He’s been with me through everything. Every stressor, every pivotal moment, he is here for. I got a job to be able to give him the best life he deserves. Half of my motivation to become a successful lawyer now is because of Schroeder. When I go home to visit my family, he comes everywhere simply because everybody loves him. Whenever he’s not attached to my hip, people ask if he’ll come next time. 

However, they still don’t understand why I dote on him like I do. He gets a bath from a groomer every 6-ish weeks, pedicures whenever his nails need to be trimmed, daily stroller walks around town and leash walks on low-risk hiking paths, an overly pompous dinner, and has cute collars for every holiday, and gifts constantly. It might be overboard, but i really don’t want kids when I get older, and I consider Schroeder my baby. Why wouldn’t I want to give him the best of everything? They say I don’t spend enough money on everybody else and it’s a waste to spend on him since he’s “just a cat”, even though most of the stuff I give him isn’t that expensive. And even if it was, if I had more money, I’d still probably spend it on him. I don’t care what they think. Schroeder has been my angel, my rock. I’ll spend thousands on him if I have to. I probably wouldn’t even be here if not for Roeroe.

"My cat had a cough, was hospitalized and now isn't eating","I presented my cat to an emergency vet on Friday night due to her having a wet cough and abdominal breathing. The vet kept her in the hospital overnight with oxygen and ran blood tests and an X-Ray. This cost me $1650 AUD

The X-Ray showed fluid on her lungs and an enlarged heart, so they've had her on a bronchodilator and a diuretic, as well as neurontin since then. It's been an absolute nightmare getting to take her medication, to the point that she's now hiding from me most of the time.  


The follow up appointment showed that her airways and breathing were a lot better and the vet said she doesn't appear to have a heart murmur, but that they wanted to test her for heartworm. This cost an additional $350 AUD and we apparently won't have the results back for 5-7 days. Failing that they have quoted me an additional $950 for another blood test and an echocardiogram.   


Although her breathing is better and she hasn't been coughing nearly as much, I'm really concerned about how little she has been eating and drinking.  


When I brought her home on Saturday night she was running around, playing with her scratching post and happily chowed down two single-serve sachets of wet cat food that she normally goes crazy for.   


Since the Sunday however, she's been barely eating or drinking. I think she may have developed a sudden aversion to wet food as we tried to give her neurontin mixed up in her wet food. 

She will still come over to her bowl when she hears me getting sachets of food out, or topping up her dry biscuits, but she just sniffs it and looks at me and then slowly walks away.   


I tried giving her some other meats, like shredded chicken and ham, and while she would nibble small bits of these it's nowhere near the amount she normally eats. I put a bowl of chicken out and she basically didn't touch it.   


I've been leaving fresh bowls of water all around the house, even running water in the shower where she sometimes licks up pooled water, trying to get her to drink something.   


I took her to the vet again yesterday afternoon as I was so worried about how little she'd been eating and drinking, especially when she's on a diuretic, but the vets didn't give me much information other than saying that she was ""a totally different cat"" to when she was hospitalized on Friday night and that she had ""improved remarkably"".   


The vet mentioned the possibility of heartworm at this stage and then started her on a course of Pred-X (Steroids) which she said should reduce inflammation in her lungs and stimulate her appetite.   


At this point I kept trying to give her different foods and it's the same thing every time, she will eat a tiny tiny bit and then refuse to eat that food again.   


I've also been struggling to even get her to take her pills, I have to wrap her in a blanket and even then I can't even get her mouth open - I'd tried using a pill gun and she bit the rubber nozzle clean off.   


If I can get any pills in her mouth she refuses to swallow or vomits them back up shortly afterwards and has foamy drool everywhere.   


I really don't know what to do, I've spent almost my entire savings and have no more money left to keep paying for vet bills but I really can't stand to lose her when she's so young and means so much to me. I feel totally helpless like I can't do anything to help her. It feels like it's only a matter of a day or two before I find her and it'll be too late. ",2023-08-15 16:17:14
Need some info on fostering,"Hi everyone, just posting on here to see if anyone could give me some advice. I'm currently homeless and have been sleeping in my car for about 7 months. I have had my little lady Mika (husky) for 3 years now and prior to being homeless she had a yard and a house and all that. However, now that I've become homeless she seems to be sad most of the time. I recently got a job finally and for a good part of the day I can't take her running or be with her. I walk her before work, during my lunch, and take her to the dog park for an hour after work (I wish I could do more but I'm doing door dash to save more money so I don't have to much time in my day) and a few people at my new job have made it seem like I'm abusing her or something and I wish I could explain my situation but I really don't want to be known as the homeless guy at my work. Currently she has to stay in my car with the A/C running all day, on my 10 min breaks I check her water and usually give her a treat for being a good girl. One of the nicer co workers suggested I look into fostering her but I've never done that and am worried about someone taking care of her or letting her escape (huskies are escape artists)

Re encounter with Pet (cat) after divorce. Can't stop crying,"I am going through a turmoil of emotions. Apart from knowing divorce was the best option I left home and my ex, and I moved out of town. I did miss her occasionally of course still mourning even knowing breaking up was the best and more logical hard decision we had to go though and even though I've been more happy general in life.

I'm going through a mild depression period and decided that as we had a pet together that once and then I should spend time with our cat.

So today that day has come and is being so so so weird. At the same time happy but at the same time so many memories and is hurting like hell being with the cat.

I can't imagine what people who have children go through. But it must be kind of the same feeling I don't know.

Was it a good idea? Bad idea? I've been so vulnerable lately, and when I thought that being with the cat would be positive and fun, feels really like a stab in my heart. I missed him so much, it also remembered me of the good times we spent as a couple so it's really really tough right now to be with the pet as I am emotionally overwhelmed.

It's only been a couple of hours I'll probably calm down but anyone felt experienced the same before or has anything to say? 

I should add that we agreed shared custody and the cat is spending the next 3 days with me! 

Thank you

*Edit after 2nd day *

I'd thought of updating everyone here it's being actually so nice and having the kitty around improved my mood so much! It's been 2 fun days, and he already has adapted and happy to be around. 

But it was so so so emotional the first hours..my god. Pets are really really special!!!",2023-08-14 03:24:25
My boyfriends sisters cat has become obsessive over me out of no where.,"I’ve been living with my boyfriend and his family for half a year now and Potato(one of the three cats) has recently become obsessive over me. I’m not sure why. The only thing that had really changed was my partner and I ate some mushrooms that we’re pretty sure was laced with LSD and had a horrible trip. The next day potato started to follow me around, purr and meow at me, and try to constantly jump on my shoulders. I’m wondering what can cause this behavior? She also likes to sleep on me, sit with me while I’m eating, and rub herself all over my stuff. She won’t leave me alone for the most part unless I give her one of my hoodies or my pillow to lay on. She now seems to prefer to stay in our room and even when she leaves it seems to be only for a few hours(if that) before she wants in again. I’m not annoyed or anything and I love potato a lot but me and my partner plan on moving out in the next two months and I don’t want to traumatize this cat, by in it’s eyes, “abandoning” her. Any explanation or tips???",2023-08-14 00:58:22
Friend’s cat isn’t using her litter box or eating as much,"My friend recently gave me their cat to watch over for about two weeks while they went on vacation, which means she’s been staying at my house for a while.

She’s been hiding a lot, from under the table to under the couch, which is normal for her but she also hasn’t pooped at all which is concerning. 

I got her on Thursday at around 5 pm and now it’s currently Sunday 9 am. I know that she knows where the litter box is currently because she has peed and she has eaten a little bit but I don’t know if it’s just nervousness, her not eating enough food to really poop, or something else. Any advice?

Edit- So I took a lot of y’all’s advice of leaving her alone to get used to her new environment, leaving her food and water close to her hiding spot and making her more comfortable and luckily she’s getting more used to being here! I checked her litter box this morning and she used it for both waste! Which means she’s luckily now starting to eat and drink enough to actually have waste

She also started to explore a little more of the house, I found her hiding under my bed instead of the couch or table in the night, so hopefully she’ll officially come out of her shell and start being out in the open",2023-08-13 21:28:15
Bored Cat,"My girlfriend and I got two cats 1 and 1/2 months ago. They are two Persians we found at the shelter and they where born in April 2022. The two are sisters and they couldn't be more different. One is really quiet and loves to just chill out and sleep. The other one is quickly bored and loves to play. (We even got her to learn how to fetch a ball.)

My question is connected to the second cat. We play with her a lot and try to keep her occupied, but sometimes (like every living beeing) we have to sleep. When we are sleeping and her sister is up and about everything is fine and they play with each other, but if her sister is asleep as well, she starts meowing a lot. I love her to death, but it's just really annoying sometimes. Every day I have to get up after only sleeping for like 4 hours, because she sounds so lonely. I don't want her to be bored, but I need some more sleep. Everytime I google this problem, the solution is: Get a second cat. WE HAVE A SECOND CAT! What can I do?",2023-08-13 18:43:38
Hard time bonding after loss,"In late June my neighbors threw water on a grease fire and ran away with their door open. I was inside my apartment at the time and only got one of my two cats before running away. I am completely and utterly devastated of the loss of my other cat. I've cried almost every day since and it's approaching 7 weeks since her passing. She was only about 4. I was supposed to have so much more time with my little family. 

I'm having an extremely hard time bonding with my other cat. I love her a lot too but I look at her and just see a reminder of my failure. Not to mention just more collateral in life. I got these cats within 3 months of each other and one of them is an orange tabby girl and the one that passed was a striped calico. I loved the fact they had matching orange stripes. 

My orange girl meows a lot now. I'm having a hard time playing with her or taking pictures of her. My phone reel used to be just my cats because of how much I loved them. I do not know what to do. I asked my ex-boyfriend, we got these cats together, if he would take her for a while and he keeps saying no. 

Part of me never wants to own an animal again. I look at my orange girl and realize I have 10+ years with her and I'm scared it'll just be 10 years of feeling sad while looking at her. Is it normal to feel this way after a traumatic loss and will the feelings ever fade?",2023-08-12 23:56:52
Cat peeing on everything.,So I have a male cat 1 yo and I recently realized he is peeing all over clothes in the laundry room if they're on the floor in bedrooms I'm not sure If he's moved on to peeing on clothes in closets but  he won't stop and when he does it he meows obnoxiously loud. When I got him he was a kitten and was already litter box trained. It wasn't a case of them lying he was at a shelter and born there and they don't move them to the big room till they're litter box trained. Also he never before recently peed anywhere except the litter box. I'm really at my wits end and have no idea how to get him to stop or why he's doing it but it's ruining all the clothes and the house really smells bad.,2023-08-12 18:14:04
Would it be a bad idea for me as a 16 year old living alone to get a dog?,"I'm currently 16 and I'm moving into a small apartment next year, I was planning on buying a smaller breed like the bichon frise to live with however I've been contemplating whether or not this is a good idea as I would also be going to college from 9am-4pm 3 days a week (this is what I'm most worried about most)

There is another apartment building close to the one I'm looking at moving to which has dog sitting services however it costs a few hundred more per month and lacks things the one I'm looking at moving to has.

Is there anything I can do to make it easier for the
puppy or should I just not get one at all? Maybe a cat would be a better idea?

EDIT: I should’ve mentioned that I do make a stable income which is enough to care for a dog/cat also the apartment is decently sized (500 sq ft)",2023-08-12 11:43:25
Leaving cat home alone overnight (maximum 36 hours),"Hi everyone, I guess I’m here because I’m feeling huge guilt about going overnight to a concert and leaving my cat for 36 hours. She’s a healthy 2 year old, we have an auto feeder (and plan on giving her more feedings than usual while we are away) and a water fountain. We intend on giving her wet food before we leave and then when we get back because she does get both wet and dry. We don’t have anyone that can check in on her, and I’m just so worried and wracked with guilt and anxiety. Will she be okay? She has plenty of toys and things to play with while we are gone.",2023-08-11 10:05:18
What does everyone feed their cats?,"Hello,

I have two adult female(spayed) kitties. They just eat friskies but they could use some more fiber in their diet. They LOVE wet food but it causes some very runny accidents occasionally so we don't give it to them often (both are healthy and have been seen by vets). We are about to change foods(we are mixing, not just changing outright). What is a good cat food that doesn't break the bank and is good for their diets?

"Kitten with diarehha, but everything else seems fine","I'm stressing because I don't know what's wrong. My kitten is almost 4 months old, but for the past few days she's been having the runs, and consistently doesn't make it to the litter box, so it's just kind of getting on our stuff

Outside of this, she acts just as playful/snuggly as ever, so I don't know what's wrong. Is there anything I can do from home to help, or at least elimate options. 

I can take her to the vet if it comes down to it, but if it is something that can be fixed from home, I'd much rather do that",2023-08-11 04:58:05
"Agreed to take in a cat after its mother passed away, now they're asking for her back.","Context 

I agreed to provide temporary care for a cat approximately 8 months ago, following the unfortunate passing of its mother. The individual had to travel to their remote hometown, where their late mother had resided. Due to the circumstances, they chose to leave the cat in our care. The cat's mother had been the primary caregiver, and given the situation, taking the cat along wasn't feasible. Upon arrival, the cat was accompanied by only a litter box. Notably, the cat had undergone declawing on all four paws. Throughout this duration, no updates or correspondence were received from the individual, although their online posts depicted life in their hometown. Now, nearly 8 months later, they've expressed their desire to have the cat returned. Over these months, we've ensured the cat's well-being, arranging veterinary care, offering a variety of toys, setting up automated feeding and watering systems, and providing top-quality sustenance. Our emotional connection with the cat has flourished. Any guidance would be appreciated.",2023-08-10 19:51:26
I am considering giving up my dog. I need help,"I love my dog. He is a 4.5 year old mini dachshund who is affectionate, loves me as much as I love him, and makes me smile. But I have always had a problem with him peeing everywhere. I can’t handle it anymore. I take him out every 3 hours, when I am not home I have a belly band that goes on him, he has a healthy diet, and my girlfriend is always home so he isn’t alone. He is fully healthy, no bladder issues. But he still pees every where. He slips out of his belly band no matter how tight it is, he pees under the bed, on the carpet, on everything. I love him so much and without him, I wouldn’t be here. I feel defeated, devastated that I even am considering this, and I just want him to be happy and not piss everywhere.",2023-08-10 13:38:03
I am absolutely desperate for help with my aggressive cat,"I’ve had my male cat for about 10 years and my fiancé has had his male and female cat for 11. My cat has always been a bit rough when it comes to playing and he’s a good bit bigger than both of them so it’s a little distressing when he plays too rough and tackles them or tries to bite them but I will say I truly think they are playing most of the time. The reason I think they are playing is because sometimes I will see my fiancé’s cats walk up to my cat and kiss him, I’ll find them napping close together or hanging out under the bed together, and often when I separate them (put my cat in a room and close the door) his cats will sit outside the door and seems to wait for my cat. If his cats were truly worried for their safety they wouldn’t do any of this right?

Well we went on a trip for a week not too long ago (fiancé’s dad was checking on the cats daily) and when we came back my cat attacked my fiancé’s cat out of nowhere, this is the first time I’ve ever seen him attack with what seemed like the intent to hurt. There were no severe injuries but my fiancé’s cat got a scratch that ended up getting infected and we had to take him to the vet so they could drain the puss out of the lump that grew from the infection and he had to go on antibiotics but he’s completely fine now. Ever since then my fiancé has been hyper aware of their interactions and gets very upset if my cat attempts to chase his cats or engage in play because he sees it as my cat is trying to hurt his cats. 

I have bought Jackson Galaxy’s anti bully drops but those don’t seem to be helping at all, today I went out and got calming drops from NaturVet so I’m hoping those might help out in the next few days. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what else I might be able to do or what might be causing this aggression? Sometimes it seems like my cat goes into a trance where all he wants to do is chase and pounce on my fiancé’s male cat, you can see this wild look in his eyes when he gets like that. The only thing I can do in that situation is just put him him in another room with the door closed and wait for him to return to normal. Part of me wonders if he has a neurological issue going on?

I appreciate any help or suggestions you guys may have, I am at my wits end and I feel like I have basically cried every day since my cat attacked his because I really don’t want to rehome my cat.

Confused and scared for my kittens,"Hi folks, I am very confused and anxious right now. I had started feeding a stray cat last year, back then she was probably 6 months old tiny little thing. Slowly she started living with us and I love her from the bottom of my heart.  She was stray before so I let her go outside still as it was unfair of me to keep her confined within the house. She then got herself pregnant and delivered 4 beautiful kittens. I have been caring for them and loving them to my fullest no matter how much they cut and scratch me. I had believed that I would be able to take care of all of them until they were old enough to venture out on their own.   
But sadly, things have taken turn for worse. I live in Uttar Pradesh, India and I am currently living on rent with my parents. And animal care like vets and such is pretty scarce here. Animal life, especially that of cats is occasionally treated like a disposable commodity. I was able to get her and the kittens vaccinated somehow but couldn't get her nurtured.  As a result, these 4 little fuzzballs keep zooming about my house. While I have no problem with it, my neighbours are not exactly thrilled with them, I guess envy is engraved within human nature. Before today, they would always try to get us into trouble with our landlord and kept on looking for excuses one way or another to get rid of my cats. And today they succeeded. This one aunty, who mind you is in old age(about 60-ish) and just bitter by nature and constantly looking for ways to cause a fight to keep herself entertained, tried chasing after one of my kittens with a stick, slipped on a wet floor and hurt her back. It was nothing serious as she immediately darted to our landlord. Someone who has hurt their back as much as she said she has would not be able to walk(almost run) so quickly. She then went on to cry and loathe how cats were making her life miserable but then out of nowhere had enough energy and spirit to come at me with all guns blazing. Gist of the story, she did this whole soap opera in front of our landlord and now he wants them all gone. I told him that I will look for people willing to adopt them and that it will take some time. His response: ""I have no sympathy for your cats, I do not care if they die. Just get rid of them within a month"". This made my blood boil, I wanted to make them experience their words right then and there. Believe me, I can be more poisonous than a black mamba when it comes to spitting venom in someone's face. But I held my cool because they were elderly and it would because my family a lot of trouble to move out of there.   


The aunty herself started giving me lectures with a smirk on her face, she said that ""In today's world, everyone is out for themselves and no one cares for others"". I immediately told her that she should keep in mind that she is older than I am and that she would be needing all the kindness in this world soon enough.   


I guess I am just venting out here at this point, I don't know what to do and it angers me that 5 living creatures have to suffer just because a human needed a bit of entertainment in its miserable life. I am angry and scared at the same time. How can some people be so insensitive?  If I had a few more months I could have let these kittens and their mother get on with their lives as strays. At least then nature could have taken its course and they I would not have needed to split the mother from her kids. Maybe I am just trying to avoid the guilt here but I am at a loss at this point. No amount of rage is going to help here.  


It brings me to tears while writing this, but heights of human hypocrisy, malice and greed astonish me sometimes. I am a young adult and I am gonna make sure my kids know of sympathy and compassion towards animals. Especially cats.  
I guess if you know anybody or any org/NGO who would be keen on taking them in or are yourself interested in taking them in and providing them with a better life, please DM me.

Is euthanasia the right choice?,"
My native language is not English. So sorry for the mistakes (I used the translator).

I adopted a kitten two years ago. Over time, he began to develop problems with his eyes. The doctor said it was congenital glaucoma. The treatment didn't help. At some stage, the disease stopped progressing and I thought that the kitten was blind. But three months ago he began to behave strangely. He was afraid of every sound, stopped eating, and hid in a corner. He didn't let anyone or anything near him. Was very scared. I took him to the doctor and they said that he was completely blind. There is a buildup of pus inside his eyes and this is most likely causing him great pain. The doctor prescribed three types of eye drops, but nothing helps. Sometimes he is affectionate and not shy. And sometimes he is very scared, does not eat. All day long he just sleeps. And I'm starting to think about euthanasia. But I feel very sorry for him. He is a living being and wants to live, but at the same time he suffers and experiences pain. I love him very much. But I can't see him suffering. And I constantly doubt the correctness of my decision. After all, sometimes he behaves absolutely normal.

What should I do? Is euthanasia worth it or not?

 The doctor said that the vision will not be restored. It may be necessary to remove the eyes so that the pus does not pass into the brain. I don't want him to suffer like this, but I don't want him to die either. I'm afraid to make a decision that I'll regret later.

I work 6 days a week and I am not at home for 12 hours. All this time he is alone. Because of his blindness, he cannot find his toilet by himself. So while I'm away, I close him in the bathroom. I made a soft and cozy corner for him there, left food and water. When I'm at home, I'm always by his side. I learned to determine when he wants to go to the toilet and help him find it. I became so attached to him that I treat him like my child. And I live alone, so no one can take care about him in my absence.",2023-08-09 19:27:29
Vet visits $$,"Hey y’all,
Serious q… how do you guys afford vet visits 🙃 every single time I take my cat I still end up paying at least $400 out of pocket even with the pet insurance (which is set up in such a shitty way - pay out of pocket first and then get reimbursed). Based on the east coast in the US. Really feel like I’m being cheated or there’s some secret hack all the pet owners know that I’m not in on because it makes no sense to me that people are able to comfortably cough up $400-$800 a visit??",2023-08-09 12:56:16
I want to save my kitten’s life,"She is not eating or drinking water but wanting mother milk which I have never fed her.

Why do I need references for a cat?,"I walked into a pet shelter Monday morning looking to adopt a pair of bonded cats. I didn't even ask to see the cats. I just said I wanted to adopt 2 bonded cats that were relatively healthy and not on the brink of death that have been in the shelter the longest. I just wanted to rescue 2 cats very unlikely to ever be adopted.

They said I needed 4 personal references (non family members), a copy of my lease if I rent, and a background check. I don't know 4 people well enough other than family members to ask to be a reference, and why the hell do I need a background check....is this some kind of joke? I do have a DUI from like 10 years ago.

They gave me an application that was 4 pages full of questions. Why is it so difficult to adopt some cats.",2023-08-08 17:43:59
I feel like a terrible pet owner,"So about three weeks ago, my partner and I adopted a kitten we named Callie, about 3/4 months based on her size. Healthy girl, bright, affectionate, confident, just perfect - I fell in love with her immediately, and she's my baby. The shelter told us we'd need to get her boosters within a month, but a sheet they gave us said between a week of ""blank."" It didn't have a date on it, so I took their word at face value, and figured I would wait for Callie to acclimate to the house, bring in a second kitten while she was young, and get their boosters altogether. This was, in hindsight, super, super stupid, and I hate myself for being so thoughtless. We (my partner and I) went to the same shelter yesterday, spent like four hours considering which kitten might be the best match, and went with a boy we called Boba (3 months) who was sweet, playful, and who I was told was healthy. I knew socializing Callie and getting Boba comfortable would take lots of time and isolation based on Jackson Galaxy, so I, stupidly, didn't think there was much risk of any problem so long as I kept them apart.

Three hours in, keeping the two of them in separate rooms (but in a small apartment where air obviously transfers) we notice Boba is sneezing, but we figure it might just be the new smells. My partner and I alternate to keep either him or Callie company, since they both need comfort. My partner calls me into the bathroom, where Boba is having a seizure after a play session. I held him steady until he stopped, gave him water since he was panting (me basically on the brink of a panic attack, but that aside) and we went asap to an an emergency vet at like midnight. He'd been eating, there was nothing he could have gotten into, but the vet said epilepsy doesn't usually show up this early? They mentioned either congenital defects or a parasite as possibilities that would require thousands in testing. Apparently he also has a URI, which I'm scared Callie picked up. 

We're taking Boba back to the shelter tomorrow because I don't think we can afford his needs, and I'm terrified he'll have another seizure if he's stressed by a new environment/moody resident cat, and I called a vet, who sounded pretty disgusted that I'd waited to get Callie her boosters. 

I feel so ashamed. Boba is quarantined in the bathroom so I can steam the room for his sinuses and keep him warm, and make sure Callie doesn't stress him out. Callie meanwhile is sneezing a little, annoyed at the smell of Boba, and the worst scenarios are running through my head. She had her shots, but if her boosters are late, could she still develop FIV? Could the shelter have missed it like they missed Boba having issues? Could I have gotten Callie sick because I was stupid and reckless and put her in danger? I'm scared to play with Boba and trigger another seizure so I'm just trying to comfort him because my stomach is in knots from guilt. 

I'm scared the vet will try and have us surrender Callie because I was an idiot and didn't check about the boosters sooner. She's been the perfect cat, really easy to train and familiarize with scratching posts and getting her nails trimmed and always using her litter box, easy to redirect so she doesn't bite or scratch, and I love her so, so much. I'm sorry if I'm rambling, I haven't slept much since the emergency visit last night, and I'm tearing out my hair from shame. I don't know if I should get a second cat because I feel like I've messed up so monumentally, but I've heard it's important to socialize cats young, and I don't know what to do. Callie had hiccups for the first time after breakfast this morning and I'm so scared that she'll be sick and it'll be my fault. ",2023-08-08 03:58:17
Sick cat won't eat,"Recently my cat stopped eating on her own. Her skin was also super red. We took her to the vet and they hospitalised her for 4 days. She would still not eat so they out her in a feeding tube. In the mean time they did an ultrasound that showed that her digestive system is all inflammed. They think its either IBD or a type of indolent lymphoma. They don't think she's strong enough to do a biopsy and they say that the treatment is basically the same (medication) regardless so that right now there is no need for the test.

She was in the hospital for 4 days and yesterday came home with the feeding tube. We've been giving her food through the tube but she does not eat on her own. Yesterday she licked the food twice but that's it. Is there something else I can do here? They put her on medication for inflammation, stomach protectors, antidepressants, etc., but I don't think they're working. Her skin is not red anymore but she will not eat. I am honestly desperate.",2023-08-07 23:06:23
Any nocturnal pets with a longish lifespan?,"I know this might be an unusual post, but  I (17) am very busy in life and am gone for over 13 hours a day 2x a week and u hours a day 4x a week and have a bit of a social life.

Please don't recommend hamsters because I've had 6 hamsters in my life and each time they pass it's just another heartbreak.

I've considered getting a kitten but people told me about single kitten syndrom and how I should avoid it especially since it's going to be a housecat.

I Rescued a Kitten and feel bad for giving it away.,"So, a week ago i rescuet a 30 day old kitten from a parking lot. I knew i couldn't keep it from day 1 because of my other cats, but i had to keep it until a friend of mine could recieve her in his house. During that week of waiting, i formed a bond with it. And today i went to my friend's house and left her there with him. 

I know she's safe and sound with him. But somehow i feel absolutely devastated and guilty. Maybe it was the way she looked at me when i gave her to my friend. She looked so confused and betrayed.

I hope i didn't break her little heart. She deserves the world. How do i deal with that feeling ?

Edit: 
Thanks for the replies, I've been feeling a lot better. And he had sent me some updates on her and I can see she's happy with her new dad.

I hope this thread can help more people who felt like I did whe I first posted it.

I can't stress enough how much I appreciate your guy's inputs on this issue. 

Much love S2

How can I get TWO stray kittens out of my car engine? Time-sensitive!!!,"last night two stray kittens climbed into the engine area of my Prius and unknownly, I reparked it in garage. they ended up coming out and running around my garage afraid for an hour but then retreated back into the engine. I do have to go back to work in 2 days and use the car so Im really trying to get them out of it by then. however, I can't leave the car out and hope for them to run away as I live in an area where coyotes and bobcats roam frequently and I'm scared for their safety. ideally, I can coax them outof the engine, contain them, and move the car out, so they can live in my garage until I can take them to a shelter or care center. I've tried honking the horn, using food as bait, and kitten noises but nothing seems to be working. I've also called animal control but they said they can't come unless the kittens are biting or injured, which they arent. is there any way I can get them out of my car and into my garage without opening the garage door? please let me know if there are any ideas thank you so much!  


edit 8/14 - the cats escaped from the hood during the night and wandered around my backyard. luckily I had a cartoon trap type thingy outside with food in it and I woke up to them both inside. I am allergic to cats so i gave them to my friend and now they are doing well and safe. thanks everyone for allt the help",2023-08-05 09:08:14
Am I doing the right thing? Early euthanasia for my cat,"Disclaimer: I'm a complete mess right now and completely heartbroken so I might not be as coherent as I'd like.

In a nutshell, my FIV+ cat has been sick on and off since April. We've been treating his symptoms as they came up, he would get better, then once again sick a week or two later. Everytime, he would stop eating, we would put him on antibiotics, and his appetite would come back, until antibiotics ended. All in all,he went from 7.75kg in April, to 4.5kg today.

Yesterday we brought him to the vet to do more tests, and we finally got an X-ray done. He's got a massive tumor that's pressing against his stomach, compressing it by roughly ~50%, and he's also got fluid in his lungs, potentially due to another tumor. He's also got a tumor on his skin. The vet said that he's currently most likely in a lot of pain (and it somewhat shows, although he's very stoic).

Needless to say, it was devastating, and when we found out yesterday, we started trying to think when euthanasia would be best. Our idea was to try to juggle our selfishness of spending more time with him, with avoiding him too much pain. And then on Saturday is our daughter's first year anniversary party, so we... Kind of have that going on.

The original plan was Sunday evening, so that we could have all of Friday, Saturday evening, and Sunday with him. But yesterday he completely stopped eating. The only food left that he was eating was temptations treats, but yesterday evening he refused it completely. So we jumped the gun, and booked an at-home euthanasia this morning at 10am.

I don't know what to think anymore. I feel like we've tried (almost) everything we can. We've spent a great deal of money (about $2.5k) trying to get him healthy, until we discovered the tumor. I've been spoon-feeding him (on and off) for the last two months or so. But part of me feels like we are taking the coward way out. And then a more rational part of me realizes that this will be deliverance for him. And as terrible as it sounds,if he was still a feral cat (we adopted him from a cat colony) he would long be dead, so part of me feels like we've bought him enough time.

I'm not sure what I'm asking or seeking from this sub. Maybe reassurance? Similar stories? Guidance? I've never been through the death of a pet before.

Edit: now I feel even more terrible/conflicted. He just filled up on temptations this morning (he had 27 pieces). I had to hand feed him, but still. Again makes me think maybe we jumped the gun too much on this, that he might still have a few more weeks left in him...

Edit 2: it's done. RIP Churchill. Thank you everyone for your kind words, it's very helpful. Ultimately, it was the right decision. At least, he is no longer suffering and in pain. And I was able to hold him in my arms (and cry over him) as he passed away.

Edit 3: I've read all the comments, and I will keep this Reddit post with me. This is, sort of an eulogy to Churchill. Thank you everyone. While I do not reply to comments (it would take too long and too much energy) it means so much.",2023-08-04 17:35:44
Got my first cat recently,"I've had family cats most of my life, but recently I've  decided to take in a kitten my family was fostering. Her name is Jellybean and she looks like a grey tabby, and around 3-4 months old.
I plan on leash/harness training her, and hopefully teach her other things, basic tricks like sit or come.
She has many toys and a playmate (another foster kitten that a sibling of mine is adopting)
Currently her diet is dry kibble from Iams that is specifically made for kittens, combined with half a small can of kittens Fancy Feast wet food, once in the morning and once at night.

Do y'all have any tips or recommendations? I'm just a little worried that I could do more to care for her is all. I will be taking her to a vet soon as well. Thank you all for any tips, and I hope you all have a lovely day/evening/ or night!",2023-08-04 00:11:53
Rescue dog won't leave crate," It's 6 days since we adopted our Romanian rescue dog, approx. 1 yr old, terrier mix. She was in a car accident as a young pup and is missing a leg and her tail.

She has been in the UK for a few months, with a foster carer. She had good routines there, was going for daily walks, toilet trained and comfortable with her other dog. We went to meet her at the fosterer and she came to our house a few times before adoption.

We set up a crate in our living room, since joining us she has essentially not left her crate. When we aren't in the room she sometimes comes out far enough to see where we've gone, but will immediately bolt back in if spotted. She has come out to eat from her bowl, but again only after we leave the room.

She has relieved herself a few times on some puppy pads placed away from the crate, but only in the night when we've left her locked in the living room. She has been very restless each night, howling pretty much non-stop. We have tried leaving the radio on quietly, a light, a pheromone diffuser etc.

She has not been responsive to bribery with treats and will only take them if we offer them to her in the crate. Luckily there has been no aggression and she has been passive and fearful when faced with brief looks by our cats (when they've managed to bolt through the open door, otherwise kept separate for the time being).

Does anyone have any tips for how we can build her confidence? We are aware that she will have a steeper learning curve than most dogs due to her past, but her big sad face every time we look at her and the sleepless nights are starting to get to us",2023-08-03 19:45:47
Need help for a premature newborn cat 🐈,"My neighbors abandoned their cat she's not very healthy clearly it has parasites in her skin and also deaf but so cute (all white fur and with different eye colours: blue and white) , she comes everyday seeking for food which I provided, when I noticed she's pregnant I tried to shower it and welcome it home but did not succeed, today I came home from work and it was a complete mess she gave birth to four unfortunate kittens 2 didn't make it out of their sack (I don't know the scientific word for it) and one already eaten by ants when I tried to clean the mess and burry then I noticed one was alive so I took it to the mom she seemed confused and didn't know how to handle it and even bit it so I quickly took it to the nearest vet to seek help but she was closing I showed it to her and told me it will not survive and didn't wanna take care of it. So I did some research and tried to feed it using a syringe and it's still alive and clearly struggling I really can't take care of it as I'm working all day long and I think it should live after all that survival it survived a long time in the burning sun (all of its brothers melted) and the bleeding caused by the mom but in the same time also found him covered with ants I think i should end his struggle but I really can't kill it or cause its death.
Any advice is much appreciated .",2023-08-03 07:16:14
What kind of pet do you favor and why?,"We can all agree to loving animals, but some people just prefer a specific species/breed",2023-08-03 07:15:04
Pet parenthood is so damn stressful (and expensive) sometimes!,"Sorry this is going to be a bit of a ramble - I think I need to just process it all and my husband doesn’t need to hear it for a twentieth time 😂

We have two dogs and a cat - ALL THREE of them had to go to the vet for various reasons today. 

We got a puppy a few weeks ago and he’s amazing, but his poops were weird the last few days so we took him in for that. He’s fine, just a side effect of his last vaccination they think. 

Our older dog had a mast cell tumour successfully removed last year but I found a new lump on her ribs so she had to go in for that. Luckily that was just a fatty lump and nothing to worry about. Our specialist vet oncologist (a job I didn’t know existed but am so grateful for) was very happy with her health otherwise. 

Then our cat stopped eating and hadn’t used the litter tray all day. She was diagnosed with being a petty bitch - she’s upset that we got a puppy and had to change her litter for a few days because the pet store was out of her normal stuff so she went on a hunger and toilet strike. Put some stupidly expensive wet food in her biscuits and she gobbled it down, then went straight to the toilet. 

Now they’re all happily sleeping away, totally unbothered that I spent close to a thousand dollars today and have about the same number of grey hairs from the ball of anxiety that started last week and got worse with every new symptom! 

At least they’re cute! 😂",2023-08-02 20:47:22
In defense of my kitties AITA,"AITA for standing up to my mother?

My mom constantly jokes about wanting to kill my cats.

Me (25F) and my mother have always had a turbulent relationship.  I should start by saying she is actually my step mom, but I was raised without the step parent separation so I had 2 mom's and 2 dad's.  
Although this is how I was raised, my siblings on the stepmoms side (23F) and (21F) view and treat me like the outcast of the family.  I've gone to therapy and made peace with it and I am very transparent to my children (two sons age 5 and 7) about the relationship that I host with my family.  They treat my kids decently so I tolerate the relationship.  
That being said I have 4 sweet little kitties ages 5 4 3 and 3.  They are spoiled, well taken care of, and my home is always clean because we keep up with both our children and fur children's needs. Our cats share a deep bond with our family and we love them dearly.  
My mother, however, despises cats.  I grew up with the saying "" the only good cat is a dead cat"" 
Despite this visceral hatred....my love for cats never diminished and I firmly believe that every animal deserves to be loved, even if you don't ""like"" the animal.  
Fast forward to today.  
I post my cats pictures on Facebook regularly and my mother and her husband will post things like ""there's our next roadkill!"" Or "" devil cat"" "" hey look, target practice""  ect.  I've confronted them several times about this and they know it hurts my family, and it makes me angry.  
I've even taken them off of my account for a time but had to add them back on due to them wanting pictures of the grandchildren.    
I wish it were as simple as blocking them, but they will actually say stuff like this during visits to our house and in front of our family.  It's...unsettling.  for context I grew up in a very abusive household and I was never allowed to speak my mind but I am very protective over my children and my animals.... I guess I'm just trying to ask is this normal? I don't think it is and any advice is appreciated... I talked to my therapist and I know my feelings are validated.",2023-08-02 12:04:21
does anyone else find it hilarious to bully your pets?,"obviously i dont mean actual bullying, like yelling or taunting or god forbid physically, just name calling in ways they cant understand. im partial to angrily lecturing my cat for asking for food, calling her a fat bastard that needs to get a job and move out while proceeding to give her the food shes asking for. or calling my dog a moocher while carrying him around like a baby. its just so funny because i know they only know their names and what time dinner is. or maybe they know exactly what im saying and choose to not be bothered because they know theyre too cute for me to actually mean it. anyone else do this",2023-08-02 07:39:42
How do you cope with wanting to own literally every single pet possible?,"So right now I only own two gerbils and two dogs. We used to have a cat as well but he sadly passed away last year. We also have 15 chickens. Even though I live with my family, I take most responsibility for our animals and I love doing it. I can't imagine life without a pet. I love animals in a way that I doubt I could ever love anything else. This includes spiders, snakes, bees, frogs, etc. However, I frequently fantasize about having new pets. Recently I've been super interested in having a lizard friend, but also really want a chinchilla or a bunny. A bird would be cool too. Of course I would not house all of these at once, nor in the same space, but it always makes me sad to think I have to choose. I want pet mice AND a tegu but I would absolutely not be able to feed any lizard or snake dead rodents as a meal. I know it's totally unreasonable and in many ways irresponsible and impossible to have absolutely every pet I've ever wanted but it makes me so sad to think that there's something out there I'll never be able to care for. Like I want a gecko, a bunny, a chinchilla, a dog, a cat, a rat, a bearded dragon, a tegu, an axolotl, hamsters, fish, birds - even livestock like goats, horses, cows, pigs. I mean what kind of life is it if you don't get to hold a giant lizard at some point? Or try to teach a cockatoo how to say your name? Or brush a baby cow? Or decorate a fishtank? Or or or or or or there is SO MUCH I want to do and not nearly enough time, space, or energy to do it all. Certainly not all alone and certainly not in my 'free time'. LOL imagine coming home from a 10 hour shift and looking after fifty animals that all require different diets, exercise, and habitat requirements. Does anybody else feel like this? And how do you cope? When I didn't have dogs I'd go for CONSTANT walks downtown, even sometimes skipping classes, just for the chance I might see someone walking their pup and they might let me pet them. Those ten seconds would make my entire day. I wish I could do the same thing with rabbits and geckos but people don't usually walk their more exotic pets downtown. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to let that out. Maybe there are some jobs that can satisfy this great desire to love things? (And not in a weird sexual way, just to clarify. I mean just wholesome, wholehearted).",2023-08-01 09:01:20
Is it worth the risk of anesthesia to get my cat's teeth cleaned?,"Hello all, my cat's name is Onyx and he is 5 years old and very healthy. I took him into the vet for a check up and asked about teeth cleaning. They looked at his teeth and said they were healthy with some tartar build up and would be happy to schedule a cleaning. 

My concern is that aside from when he was neutered, he hasn't been under anesthesia and I have really psyched myself out reading about kitties who have died because of anesthesia. 

Does anyone have any experience or advice on this? I want to make sure he lives a long happy life with strong teeth. But I also don't want to put him under any unnecessary procedures that have the risk of death!? 

I love him so much and I'm really scared. Thank you for any and all advice!",2023-08-01 01:59:10
Failure to Thrive,"If this isn't the right sub, please forgive me and direct me else where, but I have some questions regarding failure to thrive and how common it is. 

My best friend has a lot of animals. Mostly cats and dogs, but sometimes also reptiles. She does not always neuter or spay these animals and she often has puppies and kittens. By often I mean a few times a year. 
For a while she was ""breeding"" dogs as her primary source of income, but it's was honestly more like what I imagine a puppy mill would be. She no longer ""breeds"" them for money. However, a lot of her puppies/kittens die from what she says is ""failure to thrive."" By a lot, I mean more than one animal per litter with every litter. 

I have never bread animals, but a few years ago my family fostered 18 kittens during kitten season. Only one kitten died and it was due to a tragic accident. It should be noted that the kittens didn't come form an organization. These kittens were being born in the back yard of a different friend/hoarders house. We took them, all of them, and made sure they were healthy, well maintained and socialized, and we found them all homes. 

I feel like a significant number of her baby animals die from ""failure to Thrive."" This week one of her 7 or 8 cats had kittens, a litter of 6 I think, and as of today they ALL have died, again from what she claims is failure to thrive. I refuse to believe six kittens died just because. I know it's common for one to die, if any, but all 6? I know sometimes runts die because they can have a hard time surviving when small or under weight, but in my experience a little intervening helps. 

How common is this? Is this just something that happens when dealing with a lot of animals? Or is my suspicion of neglect or abuse justified? It's been really bothering me. I don't know what to think.

Edit: she is in rural Arkansas and I am in California. I have not been to visit recently and she has moved from the house I last visited. She has had animal welfare/animal control come out several times due to her prior neighbors calling but nothing ever came of it. She still lives in the same area, so the report I put in last night went to the same office that did nothing before. Here's hoping for something to come of it.",2023-07-31 12:26:37
Downstairs neighbor banging on my floor aggressively every night because of my cats’ zoomies,"I have two kittens (4.5 months old; 5 lbs each) who experience their ‘zoomies’ episode at night. I just moved into an apartment a week ago, and my downstairs neighbor has been banging on her ceiling into my floor every night since I arrived. The apartment is 80% carpeted. I’ve tried giving my kittens relaxing treats and putting them in another room, which, unfortunately, has only caused them to behave even more erratically. The banging on my floor has become even louder and more frequent. When I tried to explain the situation, she mentioned that my kittens’ ‘zoomies’ scare her dog, making it believe it’s thunder, causing the dog to become noisy and prevent her from sleeping. I now experience anxiety every night, expecting some form of loud banging on my floor. I’m not sure what to do. My kittens are still young, and I can’t prevent them from being cats.

They’re annoying and I can’t sleep, they weren’t even loud it was their normal sound, and the starting pipping louder because he yelled at them. And I said no I don’t want to make my birds shut up, it their nature to make a sound and I won’t stop them from doing that. 

But now he yells at them to shut up, when he knows I’m asleep instead. 

He even did that before we moved in together. 

He’s the only one that has a problem with them making sounds other than his mom, they both shush at them and say shut up, everytime they’re over, his dad just makes sounds with them, so at least he’s more understanding 

He’s more sweet towards them the rest of the day but the morning and evening he yells.

My cat suddenly attacked me,"I accidently scared my cat when going to the toilet suddenly. After that she started following me, hissing and clawing my legs to the point of bleeding.

(vent) BF is a terrible pet owner.,"To start off, I'm 20 he's 27. We've been dating for almost 2 years and have lived together for the majority of our relationship meaning that I've seen how he interacts with his pets for a while. He has a dog and a bearded dragon. He's okay with his dog. He's very loving and what not. The only problem I have with his actions towards his dog is that she's had a medical problem for 5 years that he is just took her to the vet for after almost 2 years of me asking him to. My mother even offered to pay for his dog's vet bills and he still waited months to take her.

The real issue I have is with how he treats his bearded dragon. To preface this, I'm am terrified of reptiles. I always have been and I don't know the reason why. They just terrify me and he knew this before he brought his bearded dragon to live with us. Despite this, I'm her primary care giver. I give her all of her baths, even though it takes about an hour to hype myself up enough to pick her up and put her in the sink. I'm the one who makes sure she's drinking and eating right, including making sure she is getting the right amount of veggies and proteins and researching her diet. I'm the one who cleans her cage out. I do all of this despite being terrified of her to the point where I've thrown up touching her.

He should not have her at all. I've seen people take better care of plants than he takes care of his bearded dragon. Before he lived with me, he lived with his mother and she took care of his beardie. He refused to get her new substrate, even though he hasn't changed it since he got her 7 years ago. She is still living in the cage he got her when she was a baby. I keep telling him that she is stressed out and needs a bigger cage. She 'glass surfs' constantly and claws at her cage all the time. I've shown him articles about signs of stress in beardies and he literally said ""that's not real""???????????? wtf? All she has in her cage is one branch to sit on. Nothing else. I brought a hammock for her and he said it was an unnecessary purchase. I brought her a kit so we could make her some burrowing holes and caverns and he said it was a waste of money.

Recently she's been constipated very very bad. I was the one who noticed. I was the one who researched foods that would help her. I was the one who made sure she was drinking enough water to help her soften her poop. Today I noticed she was finally trying to poop, since he was home I asked him if he could pick her up and put her in the sink. I had already ran and checked the temperature of the water and made sure she had a place to sit in the sink. All he had to do was put her in the water. I was going to sit with her and watch her and do everything else. All he had to do was pick her up.

He yelled at me and said 'why can't you do it yourself'. He said my fear of her was irrational. He said she was fine even though she was breathing very very heavy and clearly needed some assistance. He said he never had any time to himself to watch TV or eat. He said he didn't want to do it because he had just gotten off a full shift and was exhausted.

It's just putting her in the water????? It was one thing that would've really helped me out. I started crying and he said it was dumb to cry. I said I was sad because she lives a bad life and is very very stressed out and he said I was being dumb. He said if I wanted her to have a bigger cage I could buy it myself, except in the past I asked to save up for one and he said no. He would rather spend his money on weed then buying his pet a better living space. Then he said he was a bad pet owner because he's depressed.

I'm just so frustrated at him. He shouldn't have gotten her in the first place and she deserves a better life. I wish I could just put an ad on Facebook or something and give her away without him getting upset

Any advice on what I can do to get over my fear of her or to help her better? I know it's dumb and she is 100% harmless. I keep hoping that he'll help me out with her, but he never does and it looks like I'm going that have to find a way to get around my fear of her or do something. I take her out other than to get a bath occasionally. But I'm not lying when I when I say I have actual panic attacks trying to get her into the bath or letting her out to roam around. I try my best but sometimes it takes me half of the day just to get ready. This sounds really really dumb I know. It's not a rational fear and I don't know why I have it. I don't even like the tiny lizards you see outside.

I'm starting to save money for a bigger enclosure, but I know the second I buy it he's going to get mad at me for making a 'dumb purchase'. Any way I can convince him to let me get her a bigger space?

tl;dr: BF is a very bad bearded dragon owner and refuses to give her away or treat her better.

**UPDATE 1**: Thank you for all of your kind responses. I didn't expect this post to gain any traction but I've been reading your comments all day and they've helped me out a lot. I tried one last time today to bring her cage size up to him. I said ""we need to either get her a bigger cage or we need to give her away to someone who can take care of her"". I tried to be as non-threatening as possible, but it started a huge argument ending with him telling me that I'm belittling him and a bunch of other mean things to me. He even tried to say that she was actually a juvenile bearded dragon and that's why her cage is so small and it's actually fine???? She's 7 years old. He also said he can't give her away because he's attached to her? He's so attached but he can go weeks without even checking up on her?

This is the last time I try to talk to him about it. I thought I could get through to him if I just spoke nicely but every one of you are right. The only way to help my beardie is to rehome her under his nose. I was very hesitant to do this because this will mean that our relationship is over. There is no way I can lie and say that she died or got out, he'll never believe it. He is very very adamant about keeping her and giving her away would be the end of us.

A lot of you have suggested that I give her away the same day I move out, and I think this is the best option. I'm also going to document some of the neglectful things he does and take pictures of her enclosure to cover me.

It's not as simple as moving out. As I'm still in school, I rely on him financially a lot. I'm going to try to move out before the end of the year and until then I'll make sure that she is still being taken care of regularly even if her cage is still too small. I'm trying to make it as comfortable as possible for her and I recently got a second job meaning that I'll have more money to get her some nice things for her tank.

Thank you for all of your nice comments. They really do mean a lot to me. Thank you. Everyone is right. It's more than just him being a bad pet owner. He has no empathy for anyone. This has been a big problem throughout our relationship because he's very unempathetic to everyone and everything including homeless people, old people, coworkers with health problems, stray cats, etc. It extends far beyond his pets and your comments finally put all this together for me. This is not the type of man I want to spend my life with, no matter how much I love him.

I woke up today to the sound of her scratching aggressively at her tank to get out and this was the last straw. She deserves to have a better life. She sits in the same spot all day. Even when I take her out she doesn't know what to do with all of the space. She's constantly stressed. It's very upsetting to watch and as silly as it sounds it's starting to mess me up really bad and if ending my relationship will get her into a loving home with a big tank and lots of cuddles then it's worth it.

Thank you guys, really. She will get a better life soon.",2023-07-29 16:39:03
Selfish People Not Spay/Neutering,"I've got some family members who live in a rural area with horse barns, pasture, etc.  These family members have what they like to call ""barn cats"".  However, they don't spay the female cats and they continually have litters of kittens.  Then my family members panic and call me.  They call me because they know I will help find rescue and fosters to take in the kittens.  I've had discussions with them regarding doing the right thing would be to spay these mother cats.  But they do not listen to me.  They even had a mother cat pass away in the process of birthing kittens.  It was so sad.  I watched them dote over this cat and I thought for sure they would do the right thing by spraying her.  Another cat of theirs got picked up by a hawk and dropped from the air, broke her neck and passed away.  It's crazy!  I feel for the animals.  They don't deserve treatment such as this.

Elderly cat with cancer,"My cat, may have cancer. I blanked a bit at the vet from the horror but it seemed like they were saying stage 5 lymphoma. Both vets we took her to recommend euthanasia. We took her home. She enjoyed snuggles for a bit but now she is hiding and doesn't seem to want to be bothered with us. Should I leave her be? We are trying very hard to let go but I keep thinking what if we do chemo? But she is old and only 7 pounds. She's not eating, only drinking water. Maybe they could stimulate her appetite? But she's also in kidney failure. 
I do wonder if I should let her have a night of peace and hide as she wishes. I'm torn in the rest. 
Could I have your thoughts and opinions? My head is racing and I am a mess. I broke down crying at the pet store getting 5 types of wet food for her today. She rejected them all. So outside thoughts would mean a lot.",2023-07-28 09:29:14

I've never owned pets before in my life so I don't know what their body language or meows mean. Even with reassurance from family or friends I can't shake this feeling of doom and anxiety. When I am gone I worry if I am going to come home and find them dead and it will be my fault. They are very sweet kitties and it makes me sad that I thought I could do this but can't. I feel like they are just starting to trust me. I feel confident that if I brought them back to the shelter they would get adopted quickly because they are kittens. It also worries me because I was not able to get their cones on. They don't trust me to hold them and when I did get it on they took them off immediately. It makes me feel like I am not cut out for this or something. All I want for them is to be happy cats, but I'm afraid that I can't do that for them. I feel bad because I know going to new places is stressful for them. I can't imagine bringing them back to the shelter and how they would feel. Does anyone have any advice? Maybe I am only cut out to own adult cats?


EDIT: Thanks for the suggestions guys. I think I am just overthinking it. I will wait a few weeks and if I still feel like this I will consider rehoming them to someone I trust.",2023-07-27 22:27:45
Convince my wife,"We currently have a 6 year old small dog and my wife wanted another dog but I don't think our current dog would like to share us with another dog as she's extremely close to us especially me.
So we decided not to get another dog.
I want a cat but my wife hate cats and say that they are evil and attack people and ruin all the furniture, jump onto tables and the kitchen counter and shed alot.

Ive lived with cars for 90% of my life and I know they shed but the rest depends on how they are raised, my cats have always behaved and known what they can and cannot do.

How do I convince my wife that cats are lovely creatures?",2023-07-27 18:36:34
idk what to do about fleas. it's gotten so out of control that my parents are considering giving away our cat.,"i wash my cat every 7-10 days with dawn dish soap and i pluck anywhere between 20-100 fleas during every bath. every time i bathe my cat i wash all the throw blankets, pillows, sweatshirts, etc that my cat sleeps on. i spray tropiclean natural flea and tick spray all over my house as needed in addition to giving my cat monthly topical flea treatment. for context, we have hardwood floors and tiles. no rugs in the house. despite this, the fleas are still terrorizing everybody in my home and I wake up with at least 5 new flea bites every morning. my cat is an indoor cat and shes 5 years old. we got her when she was 7 months old and shes had fleas before but it was never this bad. if i don't get this under control my parents will give away my cat.

also, are fleas dangerous for cats health?  i've noticed that she is sleeping a lot more lately and she isn't interested in playing anymore. when I'm cooking in the kitchen she always sits by my feet begging for food, but she hasn't done that for several weeks. she just sleeps all day. she is still eating her meals regularly but i cant help but worry. am i being paranoid or are the fleas hurting her? i really don't know what to do and i don't want to lose my cat.",2023-07-27 08:01:06
"Found a dog 3 weeks ago, tried finding his owner with no luck. A few days ago someone is claiming it is his but can’t provide substantial proof.","EDIT: I am happily keeping this dog and won’t be entertaining this person or the person who claimed to be the owner anymore. My fam and I knew we’d keep him after 2-3 days of housing him, if no one would claim him. He almost looks like a different dog from when I found him, he’s so much healthier! Thank you all for your advice, I feel better in my decision 🥰

I found a dog about three weeks ago. He was laying in the middle on the sidewalk in the hot sun in front of a house. I asked the people who were outside and lived there if it was their dog. They said no, but that he had been there a couple of days and they had been feeding him. I took him in and tried taking him to the shelter, but they were all closed (it was July 4 weekend). I took him to a vet and found he was micro chipped. The vet called the chip company and got any info she could, and because the shelters were closed, she gave me the info so that I could try contacting the owner myself. I also posted on social media, next door, and pawboost, on top of calling the chip company for multiple days after I found him, for which I was told they called and emailed every time I called. I even gave them my information so that the owner could contact me.

I tried calling the phone number registered to the chip for a few days and even texted and got a wrong number response (but only after calling, leaving voicemails, and multiple texts). It seemed odd to me especially since he wasn’t registered in the same area that I found him in, not even close, had an old and gross harness on with an ESA tag, leading me to believe he was abandoned. 

Since the shelters were going to be closed for a couple of days, I asked family if they could take him in for me because I have my own dog and wanted to keep them separate for their own health and safety. The dog was found in bad condition, he’s a pug, and his eyes were swollen and the folds on his face looked crusty, and he had some skin issues which were due to his harness and having fleas (it seemed it was never taken off of him, he had a rash on his like armpits and still has indents in his fur from the edges of the harness, it was a bit tight on him). 

I didn’t take him to the shelter because my neighbor told me that it can be a hassle to get them back and that you also have to pay a fine. I thought I’d save the owner that hassle. After a week, my family and I grew fond of him, and decided to keep him after all this time of trying to find their owner. We took him to the vet and got him supplies, he’s already looking way better than when we found him and doesn’t leave my mom’s side. 

it’s been three weeks now, and someone on next door is claiming to know the owner and speaking on their behalf. I asked them to provide the chip number and they haven’t. They say the owner’s phone has been disconnected. They shared a picture of the ESA ID card but I can’t verify the registration number and the name of the dog is similar but not the same. Also the name of the registered owner on the chip is different from who he’s registered to on the ESA ID card. It seems a little sketchy to me (the owner sounds like he may be homeless) and I don’t feel comfortable with just handing over a dog to someone who can’t at least provide their chip info/number or even a photo, especially since I found him in bad condition. 

I know that shelters can only hold dogs for maybe a week, probably even less and then they can get adopted. Since it’s been weeks, is this dog now mine? After calling the chip company multiple times, they told me that I could transfer my info onto the chip after 3 to 4 weeks of no answer from the owner. I don’t know how else to verify that this dog belongs to this guy who claims to be the owner when he has no phone and the person speaking for him can’t provide the chip info. What do I do?",2023-07-26 22:06:47
Is it ok to leave my pet cat at home by herself for about 3 days?,"My boyfriend and I are going on a weekend trip to the beach along with the rest of my family. Our pug is very dependent on other people so he’s being boarded with a woman we trust very deeply.

When is it right to euthanize your cat?,"My cat (15) was diagnosed with intestinal cancer and hyperthyroidism a few months ago.

Since  then he has continued to lose weight in spite of eating two (large)  cans of food a day. These days I can see his ribs and his butt is  constantly red and swollen. His waste is often bloody and I can see his  ribs. He eats so much but he is always starving.

Edit: Today he weighs 6.5 pounds. He is a domestic short-hair. Earlier last year he weighed 12.

I  feel like it is only a matter of time before he withers away, in spite  of all he is eating. This is partially due to his incredibly severe  fecal incontinence. When sleeping, or laying down, it is not uncommon  for him to make a mess of himself. He doesn't seem to notice and while  sometimes he knows it's coming, he does not make it to the box.

This  doesn't paint a pretty picture. To boot, my SO and myself are kind of  worn down.  Every piece of furniture has been a recipient, shoes,  carpet, etc. The inconvenience itself doesn't behoove me to seek out  euthanasia. It's not his fault. I feel like I owe it to him to accept  the messes and help him live out his days, but I also don't even know  where I would draw the line. I don't want to see him go but I don't even  know how to make a choice like this...

I've  seen pets go before but it was never on me to decide. I feel like no  matter how sick he gets, I owe it to him to keep giving him the  medication and to help him keep fighting.

What do I do? Part of my dilemma is that he seems to be there mentally, but he has limited to no control of his bowels, and seems to be on the verge of starvation. The medication from the vet gives him even more severe diarrhea but without it he wasn't able to keep down food.

Why do animals like my mom so much?,"Every time we have a pet or go to someone's house who has a pet, that animal, no matter what it is, always goes straight to my mom. Like she doesn't even do anything they just go straight to her. Her job is going to clean people's houses and every time she walks in all the cats, dogs, birds, whatever, ALWAYS go to her first before her coworkers. And the ironic thing about that is, she hates animals. Like, does not vibe with them at all, she'll tolerate them and say that they look super cute from a distance, but she does not like to be all up close and personal with them. I'm taking care of my cousin's budgie while they're on vacation and I have spend WEEKS trying to tame it and interact with it and the only thing my mom has done was go ""he's cute"" a few times but this bird absolutely ignores me and goes straight to my mom. Even when she's doing something and tried to get it to leave it will not budge, it only leaves her and comes to me when I bribe it with treats and even then that doesn't always work.

Is this just my area or is it happening more and more?

"Cat really REALLY REALLY wants something, but I have no idea what.","For the last few weeks it’s getting close to a month. She bugs me every chance she gets.  Every time she sees me. It seemed to be important, she never comes into my room but these will even find me there. 


She has everything. Liter boxes fresh. Food water. Everything is normal. She doesn’t just want attention because sometimes she pulls her hand away like she needs something. Or I’ll sit down with her and let her until she’s satisfied, but she just starts up again later 

She doesn’t lead me anywhere, except she lays down to be pet. She does this when she wants something. Usually when she acts like this, it’s because the litter box is full, but that’s usually accompanied by excessive scratching and it’s not full. 

Sometimes she acts like this because there soemehting like a mouse inside the house. But she usually keeps going over to the spot, there’s nothing like that. 

Is there a way to figure it out. Should I be  worried?  Anything I should look out for?

Edit; One thing tho add if that’s she’s coming to me

She’s every much my partner’s cat. She sleeps in her room and sits with her whenever. Goes to her for everything. 

She comes to me for food, water, litter box, and to be spoiled with being pet. She doesn’t really want anything else from me. I’m her servant basically. 

So it’s weird that she she’s coming specifically to me when all those needs seems to be met. It’s just me. Her behaviors towards my partner hasn’t changed in the slightest.",2023-07-24 03:01:52

Is it possible to grow out of cat allergies?,"EDIT: Just want to let everyone know that I do in fact plan on trying to control these allergies or see how severe they are BEFORE adopting a cat. My current plan is to try to see if the allergies have gone away yet, to get medicine for allergies and work at an animal shelter for a while so I can learn how to care for animals, including cats before adopting one myself. I’m still living with my parents at the moment tho and before anything, I need to get a higher paying job first. So, getting a cat is pretty far off right now. Just wanted to make that clear. 


I haven’t been around cats since I was a child. From the ages of 11-13, I loved visiting my grandparents and playing with their neighbor’s two cats, which were outside cats (yeah I know you shouldn’t allow your cats outside, and as of now, I don’t agree with their decisions to do so, especially because these cats would defecate in my grandparents’ garden and they had to keep shooting them away. If I ever own a car myself, I plan on keeping it an inside kitty.) 

But, when I was 14, I remember I was visiting a friend’s out. I would allow their cats to rub against me and I’d pet them and stuff, and I got so red and itchy in the eyes that I couldn’t stand it. My nose was stuffy and my eyes were red and watery, etc. 

After that experience at my friend’s house, the next time I played with the neighborhood cats outside, and pet them and stuff, I got watery and sneezy as well. 

I haven’t been anywhere near a cat since then. I’m now 22 years old, and I’m now thinking about getting a cat myself. I already have had pretty bad allergies to pollen, but consistent medicine everyday has helped. 

Is it possible to sort of grow out of being allergic to cats? Because I remember one of my family members told me that they’re allergic too at one point, but when they were an adult, their allergies basically went away or were at least muffled to the point that it didn’t affect them even if they were around cats.",2023-07-23 18:09:23

Should I take him to the vet??,"Hello! My cat is 8 years old, and I’ve had him for two years. Last night he peed in my dirty laundry, and he has never peed outside his litter box before. I know that this means two things: medical issue or behavioral issue. I am a broke college student and recently lost my job, so I can’t afford a bunch of tests at the vet right now, so I’m hoping it is behavioral. I also recently went on vacation and he seemed a little mad and really wanted attention after I got back. Could it be that? Or should I look out for anything and then take him to the vet?

Update: He has peed in the litter box twice that I saw within 20 minutes and not much pee came out. It wasn’t a tiny amount, but also not as much as I feel like he normally goes.

Update #2: I’m going to take him to the urgent care near us now. Fingers crossed it’s nothing serious 🤞🏼

Update #3: the vet did a Urine analysis (I denied the blood test thinking if the urine came back for a uti then the blood test would be an unnecessary $300). Doctor is pretty sure he just has a uti, so she gave him a shot of antibiotics and gave me some pain meds for him to take every 8 hours. I had to mix it into his food, but he is much calmer so I think they’re working!",2023-07-23 00:57:09
How to convince parents to get cat food for our kitten?,"So, this isn’t the first time this has a happened, as my parents rarely get dog food for our dog
(I had to get it with my birthday money), and as a result, he often starves himself and refuses to eat his dog food in favor of table scraps. They do this because that’s how they raised their pets. Essentially, “i did it to my dogs and they were just fine” kinda thing.  Now, recently we’ve gotten a kitten. Again, they are making the same mistake and refusing to buy cat food. Instead, they are feeding him table scraps….
I don’t know what to do. They keep getting pets but just refusing to actually buy the things that they need to thrive….

UPDATE-
I tried to convince them again, but they just said that animals didn’t need it before we made it, and what’s so different now? And blew off my concerns.",2023-07-22 18:33:08

Should I report my roommate to ASPCA for neglect?,"1 (27F) find myself in a tricky situation with my roommate, Zoey (27F) and her dog Duke (2M, 50 lbs). I'm an animal lover and feel deeply concerned about the way she treats her pet.
The issue is that my roommate rarely lets her dog out of the room, and when she does, it's only for about five minutes once a week. I'm worried that the poor pup might be suffering from neglect, especially considering my roommate's absence from the house for at least 12 hours a day, and sometimes up to 20 hours.
I have reasons to believe the dog might have health concerns and Zoey refuses to take poor Duke to the vet.
I fear for the animal's well-being, especially in the current heat. Her room is one of the hottest in the house, an v doesn't even have a fan to provide some relief.
As much as I care about animals and their welfare, I don't want to escalate the situation without first getting some perspective. So, Reddit, would I be the asshole if I reported my roommate for potentially neglecting her dog?

Cat ate a natural lamb condom. Just gross or should I be worried?,"First of all apologies for the horrific topic and also idk how to make this nsfw.  My cat is always begging for food even though I feed her a normal amount, just about one 5.5 oz can of wet food a day, and is always trying to eat human food and jump up on kitchen counter, lick stuff out of the sink etc.  It's a good excuse to clean my kitchen very often.  Anyways, I bought some ""lambskin"" condoms recently which are made from their intestinal tract. (also pretty gross to think about, I try not to.) My cat has never gone through any of the trash cans in my apartment but the little bugger decided today was the day to knock over my bathroom trash can and pull everything out.  I was gone for about 4 hours this morning and came home to see that, thankfully there was only one in there from last night as I've just started using them.  Cat is acting as normal as ever, ate some wet food without throwing up.  Considering the condom is made of animal parts, it seems like the most dangerous part of swallowing the damn thing is already over.  Should I be worried?

Cat Just Won't Step Getting Urinary Blockage,"Hey all,

I am sincerely exhausted. 

My little long-haired orange Felix who has been with me through thick and thin was brought in at the beginning of this month for a urinary blockage. They had him for 3 days with a catheter and on IV fluids, and then gave me Gabapetim (sic), Prednisone and Amitriptyline to give to him once a day (and every other day for the Prednisone). He has been alright, albeit more socially withdrawn than usual, over the last two weeks. My seperated wife dished out near $2,500 for the vet visit. And then yesterday he started straining and making nonstop visits to the litter box again. We brought him in and they found no sign of the bladder being enlarged or of blockage, but gave me an antibiotic and some sort of pain medicine to give to him. Today he is again going to the litter box nonstop and this time I have noticed blood in his crotch region. What do I do? I can't afford the nonstop visits and do not want to lose my buddy!

URGENTLY need advice. My cat has been missing for 20 days.,"I am desperate. My cat just turned 10 a few days ago. She has been in my life almost as long as I can remember (I am a teenager) and I love her more than life itself. She is a small, shy, indoor-only cat.

20 days ago, she went missing. I have cried myself to sleep almost every night for 3 weeks and I hardly have the energy or will to get up in the morning. So I'm turning here for help.

We have:

* Searched the entire house top to bottom. 
* Walked the streets, both talking casually (apparently that can lure them out?) and not talking, shaking treats and not shaking treats.
* Set out humane traps with my clothes on them, switching out the clothes every so often so they smell of our house, and food inside (both her normal wet food and sardines so the smell carries).
* Put out colorful posters and knocked on every door in a two block radius to pass them out personally. 
* Wandered around with treats and a flashlight morning, noon, and night. 
* Scoured the backyards of our direct neighbors. 
* (This is gross, but we are desperate) we even tried peeing in a spray bottle and spraying it on the sidewalks leading up to our house. 
* Left the back door open (it is secured to not open further than we have it) and inside lights on. 
* Dropped treats and sat outside and cooked food outdoors. 
* Called shelters and vets and updated her microchip to say she's missing.
* Posted on Instagram, Facebook, and a number of missing pet sites, at the same time looking for any ""found pet"" listings/posts.

I've heard that skittish indoor cats such as mine will stick to houses in hopes of finding food and water there, but we DO have a large green belt behind our house. I've stomped through most of it to no avail, but I'm 100000000000% willing to go back in if people think she could be there.

The bottom line is that I need my baby back. I will do anything short of illegal to get her home. I have sobbed on strangers' doorsteps and sprayed my own pee through a spiderweb-filled greenbelt in sweltering heat. Whether something is embarrassing or gross is VERY far from my mind at this point.

I can't think straight about this. I'm going through a lot of stuff BESIDES this, and it's taking everything I have to keep from losing my mind. 

So, to people that have found lost pets or know somebody who has or HEARD of somebody who has, please tell me what worked and where my energy should be going as I continue to look for her. Even if you don't have advice, any words of kindness would be incredibly appreciated.

I will reply to comments and update when she is found. Thank you so much.",2023-07-16 10:17:44
My 8 year old cat was diagnosed with stage2 kidney disease. What questions should I bring to the vet?,"He has bladder irritation and slow stream too. As well as asthma. He is my baby, he got me through so much and I’m devastated right now. 

I’m going to start the kidney food today, hopefully he likes it. 

When I looked stuff up on the web, it said stuff about making sure his blood pressure was ok… they didn’t mention that at all, should I bring that up?",2023-07-15 20:53:14
What are some pets that I can get / have only one of?,"I'm thinking about getting a pet, but I only want to get one pet. A lot of times, I see people state that if you get a cat, dog, rabbit, or some other animal, that you need to get two or more so they don't get lonely. What are some pets that I can get one of that pet, and have that be ok?",2023-07-15 10:05:25

[Update] I got my cat back!,"Had to remove pic and repost!

Update to this post- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/14v6wuz/how\_can\_i\_get\_my\_cat\_back/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/14v6wuz/how_can_i_get_my_cat_back/)

Just wanted to update on this situation. We got Ginger back! My sisters and I went to K's place yesterday. 

We piggybacked into the apartment building so we didn't have to buzz in and alert K of our presence. Knocked the door to her place, and a short older woman with blonde hair came to the door. As soon as she spoke, I recognized her voice as K. I introduced myself and asked her if something had happened to her phone as I'd been trying to reach her for the past two days. K explained that she doesn't check her phone much, and that she was out of the city. I think that's what she had said. As K was talking, I had a hard time keeping up with what she was saying due to the quickness of her speech. I asked how Ginger was doing and explained my concern about not meeting her the other day. K held the door halfway closed, and kept saying that now wasn't a good time and that she had company over. At this point, I was afraid that our discussion was coming to a close and that she'd shut the door. I asked her real quick if I could just see Ginger and confirm he was there. She said okay and closed the door. Now, the moment she closed the door, both of my sisters started whispering that K had marks on her arm and seemed out of it. This made me feel anxious about Ginger's state. I was hyper-focused on K's face and words that I hadn't looked at anything else. Something did seem off about her behavior. 

When K opened the door again, Ginger peeked out a few moments later and timidly came out into the hallway. He came up to sniff us and looked okay. I told K that I had wanted to talk to her about Ginger's health during the drop-off, and that I was concerned about the smoking. She assured me that she doesn't allow smoking in her place and that the facility prohibits it. (Later, my sister told me she saw a pack of Marlboros sitting on the kitchen counter.) As I was talking to K, the door was fully open with a view into the living room. We noticed the woman from Saturday standing watching us in the living room, and a man (not the same man from Saturday) who was passed out on the couch. I apologized to K for not asking previously about the smoking, and I told her that I was concerned about Ginger's health and that we would like to rehome him elsewhere. I braced myself for a disagreement or altercation, but she was okay with it and asked if we could come back later so she could have his stuff ready. We declined and said we could take him now in just his carrier. She allowed us to come inside. We spent a couple of minutes inside coaxing Ginger from underneath the bed. During this time, K expressed what sounded like disappointment that Ginger hadn't been declawed. The other woman chimed in and said that I should have let them know that he wasn't. Their reasoning was so that he didn't hurt himself or others in case he got out. I tried to explain that declawing is very painful for cats and that it's wrong and unnecessary, but they weren't fazed. We got Ginger into his carrier, and K gave me Ginger's canned food which was the same amount I dropped off Saturday. We think they gave him just his snacks as a meal. I apologized to K for taking away Ginger suddenly and told her I was wrong for not asking about smoking beforehand, and I let her keep the litter box and toys since she said she's going to get another cat. And we got out of there. 

We got Ginger back home, and he was overwhelmed at first - very quiet and reacquainting himself with the space - but after giving him his canned food and some time, he's slowly coming out of his shell. We did give him a quick wash with a waterless shampoo as he smelled of cigarette smoke. And he spent the rest of the evening drying off on his blanket, and he even slept on my hand for a little while. Of course, he doesn't understand the situation I put him in. I colossally messed up on finding a new home for Ginger. I'm disappointed in myself for not doing enough. I'm also ecstatic that we got Ginger out before he could be declawed or anything else. I'm 100% going to learn from my mistake and do it the right way this time. I'll be going through the Humane Society to rehome Ginger, and we have an aunt who has agreed to foster him while we get an appointment with the Humane Society. 

Apologies for the long post. Thank you so much to this community for commenting with advice, support, and reality checks of where I went wrong. Because of that, I went through the proper avenues to get help and ultimately had the courage to face K and be honest with her. And Ginger is going to keep his claws and find a healthy and safe forever home! Thanks guys.",2023-07-13 08:16:50
Cat needs 12000 surgery - and I'm confused,"\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Updating this post for anyone scared for their cat and goes into an Emergency Room Vet. I got a second opinion and another ultrasound. Turns out my cat does NOT even HAVE a HERNIA. She might have some asthma but even that isn't clear, and best course of action is to monitor her for any changes. My instincts that this was not an emergency and I was being badly advised by this Emergency Vet clinic were spot on. I stand by my opinion that something happened in the middle of the night that scared my two cats (I think they were playing in my box closet and maybe she fell off a shelf or knocked something over) and caused some temporary misplaced aggression/trauma towards each other.\*\*\*. Thank you to everyone who said get a second opinion. You were right! \*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My cat is 2 years old. Within the last year I noticed that she breathes kind of funny, every now and then, but never appears to be in any distress, is very playful and happy, and pretty darn sassy if I say so myself, and is the dominate one of a pair of bonded cats that have lived together for 2 years.

2 weeks ago I took her to the vet. They did bloodwork and an xray to try and determine what might be causing the breathing. They came back and said ""IDK"" and that I needed to do an ultrasound because might be a hernia. Which I was going to do but I'd just dropped $500 and this would be another $700 and it wasn't urgent so I hadn't scheduled it yet.

My cat has been totally fine since then until this morning.

I wake up to hear her making a very strange sound and she's hiding away in a closet. She also defecated in the closet at some point in the middle of the night and just laid there next to it making scary growling sounds. Her eyes were like saucers. I had to pull her out of the closet. She will not stop hissing at my other cat. It's like she doesn't even recognize her.

Vet had me go to the emergency for an emergency ultrasound and now I'm being told $12,000 hernia surgery. It's not like she will die tomorrow or anything but something must have happened in the middle of the night to make her change like this.

So overwhelmed right now  - I wasn't expecting a hernia surgery to cost this much but I also dont understand what this has to do with my cat acting so terrified of my other cat. They fight sometimes and will hiss at each other but they're not actually afraid of each other and are quite affectionate with one another.

IDK what to do. I don't have 12k lying around. I will have to max out credit cards.

Am I making the right decision to euthanize my cat?,"**edit: thank you everyone for the reassurance that this is the right decision.  It’s 12:15 now, and her appointment is at 1:00.  I can’t believe it’s really happening 😓

***edit 2: she passed at 1:29… just going to work on cleaning my room and finding a good spot for her when she’s returned to me as ashes… thanks again everyone.  

****last edit 3: not sure if anyone would be interested in hearing this but one of the sweeter things that happened today was when I went to go buy my cat’s final meal (her favorite wet food- Tiki Cat Aloha Friends shrimp & tuna flavor) the cashier said I could have it for free.  And I thanked her and said it was my cat’s last meal.  This girl set down the things she was holding and offered to hug me and held me for a couple of moments while I was crying.  I have no idea who she is but she was so sweet.  I feel so defeated that my sweet girl is no longer here.  I had to euthanize her alone.  So that hug earlier was really comforting.  




Original:

She’s almost 18 years old.  Her sister passed away 10 years ago when I first got them (she belonged to my brother and I think died from being sad when he left).

I don’t want to see my cat die the way her sister did as it was really bad.  Her sister stopped eating and began puking until it became blood and had really bad muscle tremors. I didn’t seek out help for her quick enough because I was barely 18 and didn’t know what normal behavior was like for the cats until something was very clearly wrong.

Currently, I took my cat to the vet and found out through some testing that she has an overactive thyroid.  She has lost 3 pounds in the last few months, has minimal vision, potty accidents, and no longer grooming hind legs area.  Also, the vet wanted to do an xray to determine if she has arthritis but when I just look at her I can see her joints do not look the way they did when she was younger, so I assume she does have arthritis.  She’s been hiding under my bed more often during the day and I read that an overactive thyroid can cause vision loss  and potentially light sensitivity/pain.  She’s been a lot more restless too recently, especially at night…

I’ve heard it’s treatable but what sort of quality of life would I be giving her?  I’m also a bit embarrassed to say that I can’t afford treatment.  For the last 2 years I’ve been dipping into my emergency savings to pay for her food and litter (I’m a single mom).  

I made the appointment to euthanize today but I don’t know if it’s the right one.  I feel so sick to my stomach.  She’s still a sweet cuddle bug… I just don’t know :( I don’t want her to be in any pain.",2023-07-11 22:27:53
Collars on your pet. Come on folks. Do it right.,"This is triggering me after about the 100th post on Facebook in the last week where people are posting on community pages their poor sweet dog, and sometimes cats, ran off and are missing.  Or someone will find a stray pup or cat and want to get it out there to help find the owner.  This is not rocket science folks.  Buy a damn collar for your animal that has at least a cell number on it.  I had one with my dogs name and my cell on it at one time.  Amazon sells many choices and I am sure you can find them local to you.  The one my Shadow has on now is maybe 5 years old and is still going strong.  Something like $17.00.  If you have a dog or cat and you cannot guarantee they will never run off, then you can disregard this.  But we know this is not the case in the real world. Any and all pets can run off in the right circumstances. I just get so frustrated when I see these posted and I even get a little angry when I see the follow up that the dog/cat has been claimed.  Why?  Because they should have been claimed hours ago vs many having to go to the shelter with Animal Control.  EDIT:  I addressed the CHIP alternative in a response below.",2023-07-11 18:50:42
Am I the A**hole for calling Animal Control on my neighbor's dog?,"So… several months ago a we got a new neighbor with a dog and the owner refuses to use an electric fence OR leash his dog! Within the first few week’s we’ve spotted the dog within several people’s yard and wandering the street (almost got hit by a car), all while the owner was out of sight. For the most part… it’s irritating, but I could deal with all of that!

In that first month, however, the dog’s gotten into my yard (fences aren’t allowed in the neighborhood) and started running around my kids. This is a problem for me because; 1) I don’t like/trust dogs, 2) my 6YO is highly allergic to dogs and asthmatic and 3) my 3YO is afraid of most dogs. I told him he must keep the dog off my property. His response was that he’ll make certain the dog doesn’t enter my yard again (I could hear him telling his dog not to go to my house, pointing at my house… my confidence was LOW).

Within that next month, the dog was back on my yard… I told him once more to keep the dog off my property! I also told him at this point that I’d write to the HoA which has rights to remove pets when they are deemed a nuisance… I did not end up writing that letter, I was hoping the point was made!

This brings us to yesterday… I heard him yelling for the dog again, so I checked my backyard where my wife and sister in law just chased him away from my kids! I walked to our community grounds where he was sitting, talking on the phone, holding his dog by the collar. I stood waiting next to him for over a minute waiting for him to wrap up the phone conversation (or to pause it), which he was clearly not doing. So I started asking, again and again, because he was trying to ignore me… ‘Is your dog on a leash?’ He hung up the phone and we started swearing at each other, he was calling me a bigot (we’re both white men… so that confused me…). He told me I was the only person who had a problem with his pet, I told him he was the only person without an electric fence or a leash. I told him if his dog comes at my kids again on my property I’d mace the animal, he responded saying that if I did he’d burn my house down (I don’t even own mace btw… I said this in anger).

I wrote a letter to the HoA telling the story, asking them to address the issue… I said I don’t want him to loose his dog, I just don’t want his dog on my property. I then called animal control, who are going to speak to him; as far as I know, Michigan has leash laws. If our discussion went better and he promised to do better or even apologized, I’d have stopped at simply addressing the HoA.

His only defense here is that he says my kids love his dog… which, is not true! Immediately after they moved in my 6YO did pet his dog and she broke out in hives that night. I DON’T get it… he’s got no leg to stand on here, right? I can admit that his dog is the hyper/playful type and in probably everyone’s opinion is not a safety risk… but in my yard I don’t need to accept that risk!",2023-07-11 01:13:00
How can I get my cat back?,"Update: I got my cat back! https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/14x3o62/update_i_got_my_cat_back/

Hello, I could really use some advice on this situation. Any advice would help. I hope this is understandable

I'm feeling terrible right now. Yesterday afternoon, I rehomed my beloved cat with an elderly woman (K) that I have been in communication with for the past month and a half. Except, I haven't met K yet. After setting a drop-off time where my sister and I expected to meet with her and help her acclimate Ginger into his new space - we were surprised to get there on time and be met with a middle-aged woman and elderly man who told us that K wasn't home. K and I talked that morning and the evening prior, and she confirmed the drop-off time. The woman that met me at the door didn't introduce herself and was very quick and curt with me. As soon as we walked in, I started to feel uneasy. The space was quite small which wasn't surprising since it's a assisted living facility, but beyond that it was cramped and smelled heavily of smoke. I tried to explain the vet documents and info that I had brought with me and offered to take Ginger out of his cage, but she was adamant that she'd take him out when we left. I asked her to please tell K to call me as soon as she got home, as there's important things to discuss about Ginger's diet and care. My sister and I had to run back out to grab the litter box that we forgot in the car, and I thought I'd give K a call in the meantime. Somebody picked up after a few rings, and as soon as I said ""Hi K"", I was surprised to hear a voice say, ""Yeah, I'll be right down"" , and then hang up. As soon as we got back to the door, we were met with the middle-aged woman who explained that K had left her phone at home, and then grabbed the litter box and quickly left us in the lobby.

I left the building feeling really confused and worried about Ginger. He looked so scared in his cage when I said goodbye, and I was expecting to meet with K so that we could adjust him to the new place - something that she previously suggested and we had agreed on. I feel like a total idiot, I've been speaking with K for the past month and a half about rehoming Ginger, and she seemed so excited to adopt him as she was seeking a furry companion. I should've suggested a home visit. Walking in to a cramped space with the stinging smell of cigarette smoke and having to leave our cat there with two strangers without having talked with K was really horrible. I did so many things wrong. I should've left when told K wasn't home. I haven't gotten a call back yet from K about Ginger. My sister suggested we go back tomorrow and somehow get Ginger back. There's no way we can let him live in a smoking household. K really seemed like a nice older woman on the phone who just needs a companion during this time in her life. But after seeing her place today, we can't let Ginger live the rest of his life in that environment. We had to rehome him due to my mom's request, but we can find him another owner. I'm wondering how I can get Ginger back respectfully? We met K through AdoptaPet but did everything offline with no fees paid. I was thinking about calling her to check-in tomorrow and ask if I can get the chance to meet her in person to talk about Ginger. I really don't know how to proceed. I do love my cat and want him to be in a safe and healthy environment, and I should have done better for him. I should not have left him there. I'm sorry for the rambling post, I just don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

Edit: I wrote this at 1 in the morning. It's now the afternoon, and I've called her and left a voicemail. I feel like she has gone ghost on me

Edit: An update. I called K from two different numbers yesterday with no answer. I also called her this morning with no answer before calling 311. I spoke with 311 and explained the situation, and they said that Animal Control will get back to me. I’m now waiting for their call. Thank you all so much for your helpful comments. My post was all over the place, but due to your comments, I was able to articulate the situation and my concerns. I really appreciate it. 

I know this was absolutely my mistake. I keep replaying the moment I left Ginger behind. Some family members are telling me to let it go, but this is not a matter to be taken lightly. Ginger is relying on me, and it’s my responsibility to make sure that he’s in a safe place. I’m committed to doing whatever is necessary to get him back and into a safe home. Sorry if that sounds intense, I just really need to do right by him. I’ll definitely update as soon as I can.


Update: Animal Control officer just called. She explained that there’s really nothing that they can do since I rehomed Ginger at the location willingly. Just like one of the commenters said, pets are treated as possessions so now Ginger is technically Ks. The officer said this counts as a civil issue, so it’s got to be handled between K and me. My sisters and I are going to go confront K this afternoon. I really want to respectfully explain my concern about Ginger and just ask her what’s going on, but I’m doubting this will go smoothly. I could definitely picture their point of view as this is unfair of me to ask. I’m praying she takes this well.",2023-07-10 03:11:35
My neighbors are pieces of shit. I know this just based on how they treat their dog.,"My boyfriend and I moved into our new house almost a month ago. Our neighbors have a dog that looks like sort of a mix of a dachshund and a beagle. I know this because it somehow got out of its backyard about a week ago and was barking directly at our front door. We recognized the bark immediately and tried walking it over to their front door, but when we knocked, no answer. We could hear the TV on inside, but felt genuinely like no one was home or they simply did not care. The dog ended up barking for literally hours in front of its own house with no sign of the family. We started to think they may have been out of town. The next day though we could hear it barking again from the yard so they let it back into the yard eventually. We live in an HOA so our houses are pretty close side by side with the typical grey brick wall. Anyhow, we can hear their dog howl like a coonhound outside pretty much 24/7. This doesn’t really bother us, dogs are dogs it’s what they do. However, we do live in arizona and this dog is NEVER brought inside. The weather has been climbing into the 110s this week and soon to be in the 120s. My boyfriend works a night shift and will get home after midnight and when stepping outside (just the sound of the sliding glass door will set off the barking) the dog is clearly still outside. We thought maybe the dog had a doggie door - but I don’t think so unfortunately. I work from home and let my own dog out periodically throughout the day and the dog never fails to bark immediately and at any hour. Even my dog avoids the direct sun in our yard and trails along the shade of the walls to go potty. I feel so bad for it and am in utter shock and disappointment every time I hear that poor thing howling in this 110 degree weather. Even at night it’s 100 degrees. I hope it survives the summer. I don’t understand why they don’t ever bring her inside; what’s the point in making this dog suffer every day?",2023-07-09 11:49:27
I need other opinions. Should I put my cat down?,"My cat was recently diagnosed with FIP the wet form and has since lost all her appetite and stopped eating completely three days ago. She was throwing up for a day and also has a bloody diarrhea. Took her to the vet and he said that she’s in a very serious and complicated situation. She has a serious intestinal infection, her pancreas isn’t working well and has severe anemia and some other things. He said the way to treat this is an intensive stay at the animal hospital with difficult antibiotics and a surgery to put a feeding tube from her neck to her stomach and feed her using it. He said it would be a minimum of 2 weeks to get her in a good position to be able to start the treatment for FIP (it’s a fatal disease on its own) and that all the treatment would cost a minimum of 10k dollars and has a low chance of working out. My cat was so full of life this past Tuesday and to see her absolutely lose all her ability and strength in a matter of 3 days is heartbreaking. My parents are pro putting her down and letting her be free of all her suffering. I’m not sure what to choose, will it make me a bad person to not go on with the treatment that has a very low chance of working and all the suffering that it would cause and instead put my cat down?",2023-07-08 21:25:06
Am I the worst person in the world if I put down my neighbour’s dog?,"To try and make a long story short, when my neighbour is away for work he has a friend take care of his dog. On short notice, that arrangement was unavailable and we’ve stepped in to care for his dog. We are unable to contact him when he is away and he won’t return for another 3 months. Quite soon after his current departure the dog became ill and we’ve now been told that treatment will be very expensive and it’s unknown how successful treatment would be. I don’t know what to do. I feel like there are two options:

1. We pay for treatment, although it’s not something we can really afford. I don’t know what my neighbour’s financial situation is/if he would be able and willing to pay us back

2. We put the dog down and possibly become the world’s worst people and our neighbour hates us when he returns 

Any input or advice is much appreciated.

"got a cat after my dog passed, having a hard time.","Hey guys, 

I lost my Irish Wolfhound to heart failure and had to say goodbye to him after 8 years of adventures. The hole he's left is unbearable at times and other times I feel at peace with it. Before he passed I was looking at cats for him and I. He grew up with them and loved them. He was too sick to play with other dogs but I know he needed companionship and I would once he left. But we had to say goodbye sooner than I expected. Everyday after he died I couldn't stand not being around an animal. So I'd go to shelters, cat cafes, anything I could do to love on an animal. I found this amazing cat after absolutely meeting like 50+. She and I clicked right away and I felt like I couldn't leave without her. A week has gone by and she's adjusted well. Sleeps on my bed with me and is adventurous. She's an angel. When I pick her up she falls asleep in my arms. But as you know cats are not dogs. And that's starting to sink in more and more.   


Our first few nights we'd cuddle, she'd follow me around, wanted to be everywhere I was and she made my broken heart feel softer. But today she's been more distant. Not wanting to cuddle, anytime I bring her closer she moves away. I let her go and have her space. But it's almost painful to go from a dog who is over the moon to touch you, kiss you, have you say their name to a cat who feels like she just tolerates me.   


I don't know what changed and it's making me start to question everything. I don't want to resent her. I want to love her and grow and have an adventure together. I know it's not the same. I can't and don't want to replace him. But the rejection of attention or lack there of is really hard and I'm starting to find myself disconnecting with her. ",2023-07-07 10:07:48
Should I bring my cat with me?,"My cat is ten-years-old. We got him with the intention of him being my cat and that I would take him when I moved out one day. I am now preparing to move & I am struggling with whether or not to bring him with me. 

Over the years, he has gotten very attached to my Mom & her partner. I am his primary caretaker (I feed him, clean his litterbox, pay for his expenses, etc.). However other than when it is mealtime, he doesn't really interact with me. He sleeps in my mom's bed almost every night. 

I am moving about 10 hours away & he has only ever been in the car to go to the vet. During these short car rides, he would scream & cry the whole way & nothing could calm him down. He doesn't like change & I am afraid that taking him from the only house he has ever known on top of the 10-hour journey to get there would be too stressful for him. 

I know cats are adaptable & selfishly I want to bring him because I love him & would miss him. However, I also know he has a safe & loving home he could stay at & I want to make the best decision for him.

What do you guys think?",2023-07-06 21:09:31
Why do people spend thousands of dollars to buy dogs?,My sister and my brother in law just proudly told me they spent $1600 to buy their dog. They are by no means wealthy. I didn’t want to get into an argument so I left it alone. But I’m trying to understand why people do that.,2023-07-05 21:25:18
how to deal with post-adoption depression?,"I just got a kitten yesterday, and he’s 8 weeks old. I was happy about it yesterday because I had been preparing for this for awhile and was finally happy to meet him. 
today I wake up and i’m hit with depression, anxiety and dread. 

whenever I leave the room, he starts meowing for me and I know it’s most likely just because he’s adjusting to his new surroundings and most likely trusts me the most but I can’t handle it for some reason. 

I genuinely cant explain it but whenever I think about him and taking care of him I want to break down crying (which I am currently doing)

i’m not good with transitions/change whatsoever but I didn’t think it would be this bad? 

I feel uncomfortable and have had a pit feeling in my stomach constantly throughout the day. i’m wondering if getting this cat was a massive mistake or not.

I don’t know what to do and i’ve been breaking down crying about this for like an hour, advice would really be appreciated

edit: thank you so much for all of your comments so far!!! 

today I just feel generally uncomfortable and I want to know if that’s also normal to feel as well??? he’s with me right now and I don’t feel anything other than just straight up being uncomfortable

like feeling weighed down?? kinda? and feeling like this is weird and not liking it I guess

is this normal? does it also go away? sorry for having so many questions about this",2023-07-05 10:32:52

But right from the moment I brought them home, they have been scared and skittish cats. In the beginning they would hide themselves under the couch for hours, only coming out when they really got too hungry, and then they would go right back under the couch. I would stay in the room with them as much as possible, to try and get them used to me so they wouldn’t be so scared anymore, I’d even sleep on the couch in the room with them (I kept them in the living room/kitchen at first). But while it got a little bit better, they have always remained skittish cats, who’d never sit on the couch or on my bed with me, or even in my close vicinity. If I was sitting down somewhere, and they were in the room with me, the second I got up they would zoom out of the room or hide themselves. In the nearly two years I’ve had them I tried what I could, but the behavior never changed. My mom, who has some experience with raising cats, says they just didn’t get socialized enough as young kittens and that it will never change. 

Now, since last week I’ve had a baby kitten come to me, barely 4 weeks old. She’s a rescue, my coworker found her out in her street in the burning sun, sibling laying dead next to her. They couldn’t keep her, so she asked someone who could give the kitten good care to take her in, and my heart instantly melted when I saw her and just couldn’t say no to her… She’s been doing super well, eating and playing like a normal kitten, and also super cuddly. The kitten starts purring the second I step into the room (I’m keeping her separate from the others in the bathroom), and stands up against my leg when she wants to be picked up. I’m already super attached to her and fully intend to keep her, I couldn’t part from her anymore. 

The main reason I wanted to adopt cats in the first place, two years ago, was because I wanted a companion who I could give love to and receive love in return, and that’s just not the case with the two cats I adopted back then. I can barely even pet them, only when I’m about to give them treats will they come even a little bit close to me. I just don’t feel like I have a good bond/connection with them, they remain scared of me and I feel bad because they just don’t seem happy with me. 

And now with the new kitten, who IS cuddly and snuggly and loving, I’m just scared they’ll teach the baby that behavior too, to be scared of me, and if that happens I’ll be devastated I really don’t want that to happen… So I’ve been thinking I want to put them back up for adoption… I feel like an asshole for even considering it but at the same time I just feel like with me isn’t the right place for them? If they will always just dash out the door whenever I get too close to them, idk if they are truly happy living with me. The female is a little bit more social than the male (I can at least pet that one SOMETIMES), and it’s the male really who pulls her into that behavior I’ve noticed, so I also thought about giving just the male up for adoption and keeping the female. But as they’re so attached to each other that just feels cruel, right? 

I don’t know what to do and feel very torn about this, any advice would be very appreciated…",2023-07-03 03:59:07
I just don’t know what to do with these feelings.,"For the last six months, I had a former roommate’s cat living with me and we were super bonded. He was my little best friend and he got me through some tough times. He was the greatest cuddle buddy in the world and just him being there made everything feel okay, even when it wasn’t. But on Monday, he went back to live with my old roommate and I have been absolutely devastated. I will almost certainly never see him again.

I knew immediately that I wanted to adopt a bonded pair of cats in his honor but was under no illusion that the new cats would replace him or fill the void in any way. I was willing to wait several months until the right cats popped up, but I found a pair right away that I was smitten with.

I just brought them home and immediately started sobbing because when one of them got out of his carrier, he went straight to my boy’s old litter mat and sniffed it intently. Now I feel so upset that all the things in the house that were HIS things aren’t going to be his any more.

The fact that his scent is still everywhere in this house makes me feel closer to him, but now they’re here and they’re going to cover it up until he “disappears” completely. I’m still grieving and now I want to gather every tiny piece of him up and stash it away. I want to keep the memory of him alive. I want to feel like he’s still here with me.

But I feel like the new kitties here are erasing him.

He still has some presence here, but they’re mixing their scent and fur with it and making it impossible to distinguish what came from him and what’s coming from them.

I haven’t even had time to clean up after him. I haven’t had time to vacuum up all of his fur or clean it off of his cat trees. I can still pull out millions of striped tabby hairs from everywhere and Jesus Christ I miss him so much.

The new girl keeps meowing at me and rubbing herself up against me but it’s just making me sadder because she’s not him.

Now when I stumble across a stray paw print or tuft of fur or a whisker, I won’t be able to tell if it’s his. I won’t be able to find little reminders of him around the house any more.

I’m weirdly terrified that I’m going to forget him. That if I use a word or phrase that I used with him with the new cats that it will make the bond that I had with him less special.

I just don’t want to forget a single thing about him. I don’t want to forget his meow or the way he looked at me. I don’t want to forget about the way he would knead on me and purr up a storm and curl up on my chest and tuck himself under my chin and go to sleep while I held him like a baby. He was so sweet and we loved each other so much.

I took plenty of mementos - I have a collection of his whiskers in a bottle, I have his old toys, a tuft of his fur, some paw prints I inked. Not to mention over a thousand pictures. And here I am, memorializing it again in writing. Because he was special. What we had was special. And although he’s gone, at least no one can take away that bond and all the good times we had. All the happiness and love that we shared.

I know the new kitties and I will get to know each other and bond because they’re both absolutely lovely, but right now all I can think about is how much I miss my boy.",2023-07-02 06:08:48
Our cat fell down aparment chimney!,"So I got a call that my niece couldn't find her cat today, after hours of searching, we finally figured out that her cat somehow got between the outer brick and flue of the fireplace at her apartment and fell down to the first floor, which is essentially inaccessible. 

So far we've tried
- apartment maintenance 
- fire department 
- pest control
- animal control
- 311 to see if any department will help
- dangling something down for her to climb up

All say they can't help and direct us to the next in and unhelpful circle. She's responsive right now, but she's been down there almost 12 hours and I'm afraid of what will happen when the heat of the sun hits again.

Please, if someone can direct us to an organization or business that can help, please do. Also feel free to share anywhere that may have resources.

We are in Texas

I convinced my parents not to declaw him.,"I deleted the original post since so many people called me selfish. But I showed them a link that someone commented, and also showed them a whole power point of what it can lead to. my step dad argued but i showed him that there is a percentage you’re cat wont react negatively but it’s rare and he got hella lucky to have 3 declawed cats who lived really happily.

Thank you for the people who commented informative things. I ended up putting it all on a power point. nail covers, anti scratch spray, more cat trees, and cutting nails regularly. I also showed them what declawing can do to a cat and what it feels like compared to a human. The picture of a declawed cat and diagram of human comparison really convinced them. Again thank you for all the helpful information. and for those of you who called me selfish fuck you. I could not rehome him as stated due to the fact that my parents paid 3000 bucks for this kitty. I wanted an orange cat and they wanted a hypoallergenic cat. so we had to find a breeder. they would not let me rehome him. also why i “got a cat in the first place” doesn’t make me selfish. smh some people are so quick to judge. I came on reddit for help, that’s selfish? Anyways just wanted to update on the people who were worried. Have a good day y’all 

TLDR; convinced my parents not to declaw my cat thanks to all the information commented from my previous post. Had to delete the post since a lot of people called me selfish.",2023-06-30 10:17:17

"I microchipped my dog, did I make a mistake?","I recently signed my dog up for health insurance, he's a 10yo shih tzu.

For the health insurance to activate, I was required to microchip him. I had my mother's support, so I did that tonight, but once my stepfather found out, he started going on about how it was cruel because of his age, that it was torturing the dog, that it was of the devil. (I'm not religious, but he is)

My mother is feeling very guilty, and I'm starting to feel very bad. Did I unknowingly harm my dog? Is he going to have health problems from it? If not, what can I tell them to get them to understand? Thanks in advance.


Edit: I wanted to thank everyone who commented, I feel a lot more secure about my decision to microchip my lil guy. I don't think I'll be able to convince my stepfather that it was a good thing, but I can reassure my mom that she didn't do anything wrong by supporting it. :)",2023-06-28 09:11:38
How to care for an unintentionalcat declaw,"I (20f) took my cat to the vet to get spayed before I went out of town for a trip, it was set up that one of my I laws would pick her up. While on the road I receive a call from the vet that they mixed up my cat and another one, their crates for tagged wrong or something, and they DECLAWED my cat. She's a little over two years old and I would have NEVER done this to her willingly. I know almost nothing about declaws except that it takes the first knuckle from the cats paw and causes lifelong discomfort. Is there anyway I can make her as comfortable as possible when she gets to come home? 

They didn't charge me for the spay after because this was clearly their fault, I just want to know how I can make my poor baby comfortable now that her life will be extremely affected.

EDIT: This cat that I claim as mine is a barn cat/stray. When my husband and I moved to our current house she was just hanging out in a barn behind it no more than 10 weeks old (we live in the country). We've tried to coax her inside because we've been feeding her ever since but she has never made it so far. We managed to catch her to get her fixed so that as long as she was living outside she wouldn't have to have the burden of labor and delivery, she already had one litter and it took a toll on her since she was already super young and tiny when it happened.

UPDATE: MY KITTY IS FINE! She's a little out of it still but she is adapting nicely to being inside. She even crawled into my lap while I was watching a show! She has been using her ramps and they sent us home with plenty of pain killers. I'm in touch with an attorney who is CONFIDENT we can get some other form of compensation, we're hoping for all other paw related medical bills to be paid for. She seems happy although clearly sore.

I have some Invaluable advice for Feline owners,"  This isn’t a Eureka moment, And it’s not an endorsement. 
  My cat MieuxMieux  would constantly eat like had been on the streets for days. Totally eat, then yak up. Mind you, I was feeding him limited portions, 4/5 times a day..
    He is a Bombay Cat, and I thought it was due to his size, vs very narrow neck. I wasn’t looking forward to expensive x-rays, all of that. 
   So , I changed his food. I wasn’t feeding him generic, per say, but lower cost mainstream brands. 
   I ordered a bag of more premium food on Amazon. It’s been amazing. The pellets are smaller, and I put him on a nutrient dense version at first. ( Actually the Kitten Growth version.)
   No more Cat yak, projectile vomiting, Entire weight and coat is better. 
   Moral is, don’t skimp on cat food prices…. I have another pet, a dog. She is in excellent health, but I feed her a Chain Protein Kibble, ( something like old boy, lol.) 
   The premium cat food was well worth the extra $",2023-06-25 13:18:13

Someone dropped off at least 2 mothers and 9 kittens on our property. What's our options?,"We live in rural Alberta Canada, this isn't the first time we've had cat drop offs or strays around the property, but this is too much! We counted for sure 2 mothers and 9 kittens but no idea if there's more. The one mother is quite friendly and the rest are cautious but unbothered by seeing us, so they're definitely use to some human exposure. 

Keeping them all is completely out of the question, we have 4 indoor cats already and getting them fixed and letting them roam as outdoor cats is not possible because the initial cost to fix plus the cost to feed 15+ cats is too much. We surrendered 4 dropped off kittens to a rescue last year and it was $150 for surrender fees.

We're at a loss on what to do, 11 intact cats can quickly turn into more, we can't afford to fix them, feed them or pay surrender fees due to my boyfriend and I are not working at the moment due to taking mental health breaks from work. We are going to try socialize them and hopefully find people to give them homes but 11 cats is alot to rehome and it takes time. It would be ideal if we could get rid of the lot in one go. 

Any humane options to deal with them are greatly appreciated.",2023-06-24 00:36:31
Took a stray kitten to emergency care. Can I adopt?,"This morning as I went to a bodega to get food, I found a very injured kitten on the sidewalk with blood coming out of its mouth. At first I thought it already passed but I noticed its tail move, and heard a small mew. then spent 2 hours with this kitten barely clinging to life as I searched for an animal shelter to take it. Was denied twice and then went to an animal hospital who finally took it in.

My question is, if this kitten pulls through, can I adopt or will I have to pay vet fees? Has anybody been in this situation? My heart goes out for it and I dont think it was coincidence I was there. I overslept through my alarm (which I never do) and because of that I didnt go to my morning appointment which wouldve made me never been in the area I found it.

It's been rough seeing her crying her eyes out all night. We're barely beginning to search, but here's what we know so far:

About 10 days ago, her mom spotted two girls playing with the cat outside their house. Since then, she's gone missing. We initially thought she was just off on one of her adventures, but she hasn't been back for food since. Could those girls have taken her?

I want to see my dog again. Bad idea?,"I (23F) got a dog for my 14th birthday. I grew up in an abusive household. Both my dog and I were depressed and skiddish. When i moved out at 18, i took him with me. He had a lot of trauma and generally was scared of everything. Spot adored me and I adored him too.

But when i moved out of my house, I couldn't keep him. I was working 80 hour weeks and living paycheck to paycheck. He was always alone. I couldn't take care of him the way he deserved. I couldn't give him back to my family. And he was always used as a bargaining chip with them, anyway. After about 2 years, i gave him to the best rescue i could have imagined, and told my family he died. 

He's been with his forever home for 1.5 years, now. I love the family he's with. I get weekly or daily updates, and I'm friendly with the mother of the family. We've sent each other Christmas gifts, and i get updates on the entire family, not just Spot. He has dog friends, and a baby in the house he loves. I get pictures all the time. The mother always says that he will always be my dog, even though we both know that's not true. I am so grateful for her and her family. 

A couple months ago, she invited me to see them. In more a ""oh, you should come down sometime"" kind of thing. It felt somewhere between an empty promise and a solid invite, if that makes sense. I mentioned that he seemed really happy and she said ""hopefully you'll be able to come see for yourself one day.""

This morning, she sent me a picture of Spot laying with the babyand  watching the front door. Now, when we lived in my abusive home, and when i was living with my boyfriend, i was always told that Spot would sit and watch the door to wait for me. I've never seen him watch the door, because when I'm home, he doesn't feel the need to. 

Seeing this picture kind of gutted me because i always assumed he'd forget about me or be so happy with his family that he wouldn't miss me as much. I really hoped he would forget about me entirely and attach to his forever home, but I'm worried it won't happen. 

I asked his owner if he watches the door often, and she said that he watched it constantly and was always the first to alert anyone when somebody is at the door. 

I miss him a lot and want to go see him. I've always told myself that i wouldn't, because i didn't want to confuse Spot or make him even more sad. I'm worried that I'm making a selfish decision out of grief. I really just want him to have the best life he could have. It's not with me, but it's definitely with this family. I don't want to make the transition harder for him. 

I haven't mentioned my thoughts to the owner, and i probably won't until I know for sure i want to go see him. It's a very far drive, i wouldn't want to impose on the family, and it would only be for an afternoon. 

What do you guys think? I'll answer any questions in the comments.

Edit: it looks like the majority say I should visit him. I'm still on the fence. I plan on going to therapy and thinking about it more before I make a decision, while fully knowing that the family could say no. This isn't my decision alone. 

Reading and responding to these comments are hard because it makes me cry all over again, so I also think I'm too emotional to make a logical and well thought out decision. I'm paying attention to you guys, though. All of your advice is useful and I'm keeping it in mind. Thank you!",2023-06-17 10:03:05
My boyfriend’s dog wants to eat my cat,"My boyfriend moved in with me and brought his 75 pound Belgian malinois. Loving, smart dog, well trained,  but with a high prey drive. 

They’ve been completely separated except for 2x daily desensitization training, where we give them both food/treats while separated by the back screen door. There has been progress — the dog started 10-15 feet from the door without barking and now can get around 5 feet away. 

[we’ve put less emphasis on scent swapping stuff because we/our clothes smell more like our respective animals than a once used petting cloth does]

It’s been two weeks and it just seems like there is a big leap from where we are to the next step, which is just uncovering the back glass door at all times (which is currently shielded apart from training time) so they can see each other and not bark/lunge. Currently, the dog needs 100% human attention and -constant- bacon bits in order to not bark.  

My boyfriend says that the dog does this because she’s “scared” and wants to chase the cat away. But IMO they don’t call it a “prey drive” for nothin. I’m contemplating the addition of either scolding or water-spraying to show the dog that we, her precious humans, don’t WANT her to do this. As opposed to just giving her treats when she happens to not bark — a reward that goes away as soon as the human does.  But my boyfriend doesn’t believe in negative punishment and thinks that will make her more anxious / add a sense of fear of the cat.

Any ideas for how to modify/advance our training given our circumstances? Any suggestions would be so appreciated. Thanks!

Edit 1 - My boyfriend got the dog from the pound as a puppy and did not know she was a Malinois. He has done a ton of research and become an excellent, diligent trainer. Neither of us is in a rush. We know this will take time. I’m just looking for advice on how to bridge these two phases of exposure, critiques on what we’re doing, or adjustments given the details of our specific situation. The cat and dog are completely separated at all times. Thanks!

Edit 2 - No, I am not breaking up with my boyfriend over this. We’re partners, and suggesting we just toss that out just makes it seem like you’ve never actually had a serious relationship yourself. We are happy.

Edit 3 - If you are a proponent of keeping them separated permanently, or always under supervision, just say that. Don’t tell me I’ve as good as killed my cat already despite them being completely separated behind locked doors. That’s not helpful

Edit 4, lol - I did clickbait this title on purpose to get more than one response, and boy has that backfired. FYI I posted this asking for ADVICE from people who KNOW WHAT THEY’RE TALKING ABOUT not from some run of the mill cat owners here to tell me I’m killing my cat and need to break up with my boyfriend LOL. Don’t say we’re not taking precautions or doing proper training when that’s…. exactly what we’re doing… In training… In seeking advice…. In hiring a pro if/when it’s time. If you’re here to tell me I don’t love my cat, fuck you, go take a walk or watch a movie or something. And THANK YOU to people who actually have valuable advice! I really really appreciate it!",2023-06-16 00:40:10
Why do Street cats keep trying to live with me,"Ever since I was a kid whenever we moved the nearest street cat would always try to live with me, sadly when I was young I wasn't allowed to keep any of em but now that I'm living on my own it still happens, I moved within this month and a Male Cat just ploped its self outside on my veranda and now just won't leave, and another mother cat just dumped her kitten on me yesterday,I never even interacted with this mother cat, she just walked up to my varenda with a kitten in mouth and left it there and ran off, I was with My dog and the male cat chilling and the mum still approached us and dumped her kitten, poor kitten was just shocked staring at the 3 of us till my dog sniffed it and it hissed at him (the kittens fine and now friends with dog/male cat).

Why does this keep happening to me? My Pops says I got good vibes that's why, but I don't belive in ""vibes"" so anyone else know why these cats keep trying to live with me? Is it cause I don't chase em and just continue chilling on my varenda or such? So they feel they can stay around me/my dogs?",2023-06-15 02:39:50
My cat just pooped a tapeworm,I think she just pooped the whole thing out. I'm not sure though. The worm was huge and literally moving. My question is: Will it poop more tapeworms?

Cat doesn't recognize dog after moving to a new house.,"We have 4 cats and 1 dog. The 2 younger cats (about 9 months old, had them since they were 3 months) are brothers and have known our dog their whole lives and have lived in harmony with him since they came home. They love to play with him.

We recently bought a home and moved the dog to the house first while the cats stayed at our old place for a few days while we got everything settled to make it less stressful for them. When we brought the cats to the new house, we isolated them in a room together with some of their things and all  their necessities to help them acclimate. We let them out of said room after 2 days to explore the house when the dog was outside. Everything seemed to be going great... until the dog came inside. He is not a prey-driven breed and does not chase them so I don't know what triggered this but one of the younger cats did not recognize him and went into a complete panic, hissing and spitting and literally trying to climb the walls with his fur standing up and his tail puffed. I've never seen him like this before and it's freaking me out.

As I write this, I'm sitting in a bathroom with said cat and dog. The cat is up on a ledge on the wall about chest height and the dog is lying on the floor. I've gotten the cat to calm down by giving him affection in close proximity to the dog, trying to give him a positive association with our pup. He's loving back on me, letting me pet him, etc. so it's not as bad as it was a few moments ago. But holy crap, I've never heard of this happening. Could it just be the stress of the move? He acts like he doesn't recognize our dog and has never even seen a dog before. Google was useless about this topic so I figured I'd turn to reddit. Help! What do I do?

ETA: The other cats seem completely fine. The other young brother is unphased by the dog and has been following him around and hanging out with him and acting completely normal.",2023-06-13 23:53:02
"I went on a week long vacation with my family, we put our dog in a doggy hotel, when we returned he wasn’t as excitable as he was before.","Now there’s a couple things I must clear up. We didn’t have anyone available to watch him and my grandfather was the one to pick him up from the place. The place held multiple dogs, but they seemed to be happy when their owners picked them up. My dog is a male staffy, he’s very lovey and gets along with other dogs wonderfully, never mean and I mean absolutely never, the doggy hotel told us he had great temperament with the other dogs.

Anyway, when we got home he was lethargic, wasn’t as happy as before. Usually he’d have the zoomies, he would cob on us, play with us constantly, just normal happy dog stuff.

But when we got home home, our grandfather had picked him up at 11:00 am and dropped him off at 7:00 pm ( we got home around 8 pm), he was slow moving, his tail wasn’t wagging nearly as much as it usually is, and he stayed in his cage for the majority of the night despite us trying to get him out of it. The day after he was still kind of mopey, but lightened up a bit and sat on the couch with us like he normally does. Today, he was more active, but has only eaten 2 scoops of food, when we normally give him 5. In fact, he hasn’t been eating normally ever since we got back.

We gave the doggy hotel the same exact food we normally feed him, we gave him his blanket, his bone, everything he normally has here at home.

I have recently found out that in between the time of pick up and drop off at our house, my uncle who stays at my grandfather’s told my dad he was going to “train” our dog.

This is where I want to know what might be wrong with him. So far I’m thinking…

1. He’s sick/contracted something from the doggy hotel.

2. Sad because our house isn’t as fun as the doggy hotel.

3. Thinks we left him when we went on vacation and is sad about that.

4. My cousin abused our dog.

As much as the 4th option seems far fetched, my cousin is a very “red neck” type of guy, can joke about being violent and has narcissistic personality disorder. By no means does this mean because he’s narcissistic he is naturally violent, it’s just known that he has a short temper and is sometimes violent with his own dog.

I would really like to know which one sounds most realistic, because every option is bad, but if I can guess what is most possible we can work things out.",2023-06-13 06:11:14
Is it time to put my dog down?,"Just some background info. I have had my childhood dog, a hyperactive white Labrador, since I was 7 and now I’m almost 19. She is almost 12. Around nine months ago she was diagnosed with cancer. She now has a large tumor (large softball size) surrounding her neck. For a while I’ve known that her health has been declining, especially in the past few weeks. She currently struggles to breathe when laying down, is lethargic, pants and licks constantly, and only eats wet food and scrambled eggs. She also struggles to sleep at night due to her labored breathing. Keep in mind, she usually eats anything and everything, even if it’s inedible. Even though she struggles, she’s still happy and shows us affection and wags her tail for us, but I’m wondering if it’s time to put her down. Please help :(",2023-06-11 12:28:18
Cat debate,"My husband and are having a little debate about our cat. I’ve had him (the cat) for about 8 years. He’s always wanted outside and occasionally has escaped but never went far and I got him back. 

My husband thinks I should let him explore outside, essentially becoming an inside/outside cat. He’s up to date on vaccines, and he’s fixed. 

Is it as bad of an idea as I think it is? I’m just worried he will get lost or run away for good but I don’t want him to be unhappy, longing for outside all the time lol",2023-06-11 03:28:39
I wish Banfield Pet Hospital never came into my life.,"Honest to God, stay the hell away from this McVet. They are refusing to refill a life-supporting medicine for my cat until I get some testing done, which another vet is telling me is pointless because the results will be bad if she's going several days without her meds refilled. They didn't respond to my calls or return them on several occasions including now to set an appointment, and now we even have other vets telling us to please find a new vet because they are super willing to kill my cat in the pursuit of profit. Not to mention they are the rudest people I've ever had the displeasure of doing business with.

DO NOT GO TO BANFIELD PET HOSPITAL.

Update:
We have an appointment to get her set up with a new vet soon. Jumping through some hoops with other vets to get refills until then, and hopefully never going back to Banfield.🤞",2023-06-10 10:46:18

What kind of cat litter do you like the most? Pros and cons?,"Hi everyone, I have two senior kitties that are my pride and joy. After using clay for years, I was fed up with pretty much everything about it. It sucks! So I made a switch.

I tried grass seed cat litter-
Which worked pretty well and was priced reasonably. I used this for about 2 years exclusively. However, it tracks EVERYWHERE due to how lightweight it is. My cats seem to grab pawfuls of the stuff before they jump out of the box. I would describe the odor control as 'alright'. I eventually got fed up with it after my recent move to a carpeted apartment..

So I tried walnut litter-
Which performed amazingly and was low tracking. There was one issue though.. One of my cats has all white feet and belly. He jumps out of the box with 4 dusty brown paws 🙁 So I decided to move on to try other options.

I moved on to pellet pine litter- 
I tried the non clumping pellets, which despite being cheap, needed much more frequent complete changing so it wasn't any more cost effective in the end. The odor control is also very mediocre. One of my cats has never covered her poo and I don't think she plans on starting anytime soon. My other cat has early kidney disease and pees a LOT. Therefore, the non clumping pellets aren't a good option for me either.

Finally, I tried clumping pellet litter (okocat)-
I find this to also have mediocre odor control (though a slight improvement from non clumping) Additionally, the clumping isn't very strong and clumps often break up when I'm scooping the box. With both these issues, the price tag seems exorbitant.

I've considered silica litter, but I've read a lot of things about potential respiratory issues caused by it. My oldest kitty (17m) already gets sneezy from light allergies so I'm really hesitant about trying it.

Paper litter seems to be a worse version of the pine litter in every aspect, and I don't really want to deal with cat pee paper mache all over the box and beyond. I've decided not to waste my time and money trying it.

So, that all being said- I'm at my wits' end trying to find a litter that performs the way I would like and is safe for my kitties.

What matters most to me:
- Great odor control (1 cat doesn't cover poo, 1 pees tons)
- Doesn't track everywhere (I can't take the litter in the carpets and in the bed.. 🤢)

Please, let me know what type of litter you use, and what you believe the pros and cons to be. I really appreciate you reading and would love to hear any thoughts you have on the matter.",2023-06-09 02:18:26
Researchers successfully test one-time injection to permanently spay female cats,,2023-06-07 22:54:24
Would I be considered to be the asshole to keep a stray cat that I payed to get spayed?,"I live neer a small shop that has this friendly cat ""working"" for them. This cap basically needs to find her own food and is basically a stray. Every so often this cat gets pregnant and before the kittens are ready to be taken from their mother the shop owners and workers give them away. This last time I told them that what they were doing was wrong and that she should get spayed. I have seen how a cat is broken by having litter after litter and I have a big soft heart for animals. So I told them that I would pay to get her spayed. When I picked her up after her surgery yesterday I was told to keep her calm and not jumping or doing to much exercise. I plan on telling the shop people that there were complications during the surgery and that I will only be getting back the cat later. But would I be the asshole if I told them that the cat had died and keep her for myself?",2023-06-06 22:59:01
Chewy.com Is Incredible,"Raine, my 18.5 year old Husky (yes, 18.5 years), just passed away early the morning of June 4th. Oddly enough, June 3rd is my birthday, so it's almost like she waited until it was over so it wouldn't be that day. We were as prepared as we could be, but it's obviously still super difficult.

I had placed an order last week for several things from Chewy. Not all of it was for Raine, so I contacted them late last night just to ask if I could return one of the items from the order and explained why I was asking. Today, I received an email from them telling me they had refunded my entire order and not to bother sending anything back. That included all the dog items, but also the stuff I had ordered for other pets. They said I could just keep or donate everything. As if that wasn't already amazing of them, they also sent a beautiful flower arrangement to my house, along with a card and condolences.

This was beyond amazing to me. For any company go above and beyond (and then some) like this is super rare, especially in 2023. I almost never take the time to post anything online about any experiences with companies, both good or bad really, but I was blown away by the compassion.

Please give Chewy.com all your business for all your pets whenever possible. They deserve it.",2023-06-06 09:38:39

Maybe it is time to let my 18 year old cat go?,"What should I do?

My 18-year-old cat has had hyperthyroidism for the past 3 or 4 years. Probably due to her hyperthyroidism, she is constantly drinking water and is always hungry, even if I feed her double portions. She also constantly using the litter box.

In the past 6 months, she seems to have very stiff back legs, which are always bent rather than straight when walking. She also smells strongly of urine, which has never happened before. I suspect it is dribbling down her legs or she has stopped grooming.

Worst of all is her constant yowling. I suspect she has dementia because sometimes when she's yowling in the hallway, I walk over to her and when she sees me, it changes to a regular meow, sometimes mid-yowl. Or she's in pain. 

Even worse, in the last two days, she has started to spot pee everywhere. When I had her on my lap, she peed a little bit on me. Now she's under the couch.

I'm hoping to take her to the vet this week. I took her 3 months ago and her tests came out fine but I wonder if her kidneys are failing now. 

Any thoughts or past experience? I adopted her from a shelter at 4 years old in 2009.",2023-06-05 12:28:44

"20 year-old cat, female, indoor only, has blood in her urine","We noticed this a few weeks ago and took her to the vet and they couldn't get a urine sample but they gave her an antibiotic assuming it was a UTI (because they felt her and didn't feel a mass or anything). Well, we just noticed that she still has blood in her urine, almost like a blood clot. What else could it be if not a UTI? She does have kidney disease but not severe. We treat her with subq fluids. She also takes an arthritis pain medication for senior cats. And her food is kidney diet food. She has some thyroid issues but the vet prioritizes kidney diet over thyroid diet (I guess the thyroid diet would counteract the kidney diet food, and kidney treatment is more important).",2023-06-04 02:52:41
Feeling guilty about my dog sleeping,"I have a 7 months old lab who is just an absolute angel. I work full time from home and I take him for an hour walk in the morning and hour or hour and a half in the evening. During my work hours (9 to 5) he usually just sleeps or chews on his toys, and that just breaks my heart. Given the nature of my job, I can’t engage in playtime with him while I’m working, and I just feel guilty about. I can’t quit my work to play with my dog because that’s just ridiculous, but at the same time, I can’t help blame myself that I didn’t think out fully before getting him.

Over the weekends, I take him to dog parks, training, and just around the neighborhood a lot more. But somehow, watching him just lay around while I work makes me a little sad. Is this normal? Are there ways to engage him, or is it okay to leave this situation as is? Thanks!",2023-06-02 23:52:54
Unexpected Guilt and Emotions after Adopting my First Dog Out on My Own,"Well this came out of nowhere 

I’m 27 and ever since I was 7 years old my family has had a family dog.

One of them is still alive and as happy and rambunctious as ever. His name is Tristan and He’s 14 (we rescued him when he was one). 

He and I spent 7+ years home every day together when I was working from home and then in college 

I moved out a year and a half ago at 26 to a town 200 miles away. Tristan still lives in my childhood house with my parents. 

I spent the last two months searching / applying. 

But this week I was matched with and brought home Sprout. 

The Humane Society found him on the side of the road outside Pittsburgh. They held him for a week to 10 days and no one came. He wasn’t neutered and didn’t have a chip. 

They named his Brussel Sprout. 

He’s a sweet little 3 year old half pug / half Brussels Griffon.

But what I wasn’t expecting was the wave of emotions that would wash over me when I got home with him. 

Sprout is EXTREMELY well trained in every way. It’s scary how perfect he is. 

He’s used to being in a crate (he seemed to know exactly what it was, hopped right in, and went to sleep on the way home), loved being in the car, is 100% house trained, and knows almost all basic commands. 

But it’s that realization brought on the first tears - the fact that someone / a family obviously took amazing care of him (before he got away) and loved him. 

My good cry came from some sort of wave of guilt that I’m letting Tristan down somehow. 

Tristan is / was very protective and territorial. 

He’s getting better / gentler as he gets older but the thought of me never being able to see him again happy is tearing me up inside. 

Then there’s the imposter syndrome / guilt. 

This little guy is definitely a Velcro dog. 

Tristan is a love bug but as a Shih Tzu / Bichon he’s also very, very independent. He’ll lick you to death for a minute but wasn’t into being right next to you or on you. 

He’d always find his own thing to do in the house when you were home and didn’t need constant contact. 

I guess that’s why I never really worried or thought twice about leaving the during the day 

Sprout’s breed needs constant touch / contact and I’m worried I’m not good enough for some reason after spending time with him. (It’s been less than 24 hours). 

He slept on me all night. 

I’m terrified that I’ll be letting him down if I leave for a few hours. 

I know this is a lot for Reddit but has anyone else worked through similar feelings / emotions?",2023-06-02 19:24:26
Missing Dog," 

**URGENT PLEA** **to pet lovers and super pet sleuths** from a sullen family who misses their dog. We are pleading for help with finding our beloved missing angel named Anastasia. She disappeared on 5/23/2023 at approximately 7:30 pm CST from Vernon and Upton Street intersection in Houston, Texas, 77020. She got lost while attempting to look for her mom.

**Description:** Anna is a 3-4 pound tan and white chihuahua over ten years old. She is wearing a turquoise floral collar.

**Personality traits:** She is skittish but affectionate. Loud noises startle her. However, she loves sunsets and the cacophony of singing birds. She has NEVER been away from her human or dog family. So, she is more than likely scared and anxious. She wants to be with her family, who love her immensely.

**Medical information:** She takes daily medicine for Arthritis. She gets cold easily and suffers from hypoglycemia after long periods without food.

**Important Clues:** She has not been seen since 5/23/2023. Thus, we suspect she is being held against her will in someone's house. So, if you know someone who recently got an older chihuahua, please contact us immediately. We are miserable without her.

**Message to her captor(s):** Please return Anastasia to her family. She needs her medication, and more importantly, she needs our love. We pray that God convicts you and you will have no rest until you return her to us. Please do the right thing. We are offering a substantial monetary reward for her return.

**Message to Anastasia:** Dearest Anastasia, we will continue to look for you relentlessly. You are our precious gift from God. We WANT you home with us. Paris (your mother) is grieving for you. We are ALL sad and heartbroken. We pray that God will send you back to us. By faith, we are anticipating our glorious reunion with you. Loving you always...

**Contact information:** Please call 713- 496-2562 anytime, day or night, to be a modern-day superhero in the lives of those who love Anastasia.",2023-06-02 05:32:49
is it okay to get a new cat,"my cat died may 25th. we grew up together. she was going to be 12 this june. i’m still a minor myself. i loved and still love her with all of my heart. 

here is my dilemma, i have trouble getting out of bed normally. my mental health is …not the best. my cat was a reason to get out of bed every morning, she relied on me and i relied on her. she was a reason for me to keep pushing. 

my friend told me of a kitten that is in need of a home, and offered the kitten to me knowing how hard it has been for me in an empty and quiet house without a pet to take care of. 

i am in no way trying to replace my late cat. she cannot be replaced. i just want to feel needed. i have so much love to give but no where to put it. i would love to have another pet to liven up my life again. to bring the sense of belonging back into my life. 

but, i cannot shake this feeling of guilt. i don’t want my late cat to think i’m trying to replace her, i’d never. i just need somewhere to put my love. 

so my question is, is it okay for me to adopt and raise this kitten that i’ve been blessed with the chance to adopt? or is it a horrible thing? 

i’ve never went through anything like this before, so i just need some advice. please help. thank you. i hope no one else ever has to lose a pet. i am empty without mine.

edit: i just wanna thank every single one of you for your kind words and advice. i also really appreciate that this became a space for us all to share our stories. hearing what everyone has been through makes me feel less alone. i will be getting the kitten!",2023-06-01 10:17:02

My parents died and left their cat with bad anxiety,"My parents died recently about a year apart and they had a kitten that I had brought home and given to my mom. The kitten grew up during COVID and had my parents home with them pretty much every day his whole life and had a lot of energy but was happy playing with the family.
He would sleep with my mom and watch TV with my stepdad and had a very strong bond with my parents and my parents' schedule.

My mom died first and the cat got very attached to my stepdad with her gone. Then, my stepdad died with the cat right next to him overnight.

I have the cat now but he has extreme anxiety about people even leaving his sight (especially leaving our room or hearing people go in and out of the house). I have tried catnip because I heard it helps with cats seperation anxiety and he gets to go out on the porch quite often but he still gets up a lot late at night and early morning and throughout the day to cry out and put his paws on the door pulling at the door. It is very sad.

I played with him a lot as a kitten but I wasn't there all the time for him like my parents were so he knows me but I'm different than them for him.

We also lost two other cats that were his friends (he is the youngest) and I recently had to take him out of my parents' home. 

I don't exactly know what to do and I'm considering Feliway or a vet trip but I know he's just sad so I don't really want to medicate him. I want to know what I should do for him now before he gets so codependent on myself and my partner that it exacerbates whatever anxieties he already has if we have to leave him or the house.

Thanks! (I am thinking like techniques or therapies that I can employ with him to help his mental health and grief).",2023-05-31 03:09:32
Do I give up on the chair?,"We have two kittens, both adopted last fall (so soon won't be kittens anymore). Starting a couple of months ago, one of the cats started peeing on the rocking chair in our daughter's room. The chair isn't new, neither is the daughter. We washed and did our best to remove the smell, but before we could even put the pad back on the chair (it's removable) he peed on it again. So, we threw out the pad and got a new one. He peed on it in less than 24 hours. We cleaned it with pet spray, vinegar, added Feliway all over the room, and covered with a waterproof crib mattress cover. Yup, peed again this morning. 

Should we just give up on the chair? It's the only thing he pees on, except for the one time he peed on my husband while he was in bed. We like the chair but now can't use it. My only concern is that if we throw it away he'll find somewhere else to pee.

Yes, we took him to the vet. He's fine, just unhappy about something. The first time it was just after my mom (and her cat) stayed with us for a few days, who at the time he hadn't warmed up to. More recently I think it might be when I'm not home for a few days (been doing a lot of work travel, plus we were all away over the weekend). He still has company with the other cat (who he loves) and my husband, but he might be fixated on me. He's an insane cuddler, so I think needs more attention than normal.",2023-05-30 20:38:48
Is it bad to adopt a cat from pet smart?,"I know that pet smart is not an ethical organization, and I wouldn’t be considering this if it weren’t for the circumstances. About a year ago my cat passed away, and it was really devastating to my family. Since then, her sister cat has been depressed, and the vet advised us to get another cat, which we were planning on doing anyway. We’ve been to all the SPCAs in the area, and they only had elderly cats, which we don’t think is a good idea as our other  cat is only 4 and we don’t want to put her through another loss. While at a petsmart on the way home from a trip a few hours away, we saw a precious 4 month old cat who looks just like our other cat. She’s incredibly sweet and sociable. I did some research and it says that cats at petsmart are actually from a shelter nearby and so buying them won’t benefit the store, and the animals are no more likely to have health problems than any other cat, as opposed to the animals they actually sell which often are sick. Is this true? I called and the cat is still there and we think we might go get her.",2023-05-30 03:37:51
I think I have failed my cats.,"I have two beautiful cats: One a 11 year old Tux girl and a yellow tabby 10 year boy. Both had been with me through thick and thin, better and the worst. Though sadly.. as of recently since March of this year things have started to fall apart. One by one.

In March it was my boy getting sick during the first start of the month, and we later learned he has a low kidney issue based on the blood work. Since learning this I had looked up all the info, food, treats, sites, asking my vet (though we changed a new one since the one I was seeing wasn't helpful), anything I need to do to help him. So, first I started off with a senior food that could help, but then my Tux wasn't having with the food and had been biling back in April since the change a few times, and we had to go to the vet twice due to it.

So I tried again with a kidney support food, almost worked till 7th day of transition when I made a boo boo of giving my boy two of the new food as treats (as other treats he would throw up) and he threw his food up and had to go back to the old, thus my Tux cat losing weight due to the senior food she was picky with before switching back to the old for a short time till I figure out what other food would help them.

Today I'm looking both of my beautiful cats, now seemingly unhappy or tired, one trying to gain weight and while the other just not as lively anymore and I believe I am failing them.

I am hurting them.",2023-05-29 22:27:36

BOTH dogs suddenly lame in two hour period at DIFFERENT times?," 

This is the weirdest thing. I have two dogs:

**Dog 1**

Age: approx 1

Sex/Neuter status: Male neutered

Breed: Mix, mostly small poodle and shih tzu

History: has had parvo, which he recovered from shortly after we adopted him from dog shelter

Clinical signs: highly hesitant to walk on back legs, but slightly recovered in two hour span since I got home, very legargic (usually very energetic)

Your general location: Austin TX

**Dog 2**

Age: approx 3

Sex/Neuter status: Female speyed

Breed: Boston Terrier

History: No illnesses.

Clinical signs: was as energetic as usual, high energy greeting when we got home. But in the last hour or so has exhibited complete paralysis in back legs. I dont think she can even move them. I found her on the couch sitting with them dead straight.

Your general location: Austin TX

I left for the day and left them for a few hours at home. We had exercised them in the morning as usual. It was unusual to leave them at home that long but we had a day out planned so figured theyd be fine for 4 hours. When we got home Dog 1 was lethargic and could barely walk in hind legs. He stayed sleeping/lying down for a couple of hours. Dog 2 was fine. Dog 1 then started getting slightly better. Not huge progress but the right direction. Meanwhile I found Dog 2 with complete paralysis in back legs. I don't think she can even move them. I found her on the couch sitting with them dead straight. From being completely fine!

I checked Dog 2 for ticks, nothing.

What should I do? This is terrifying!",2023-05-28 10:13:42
Tips on getting bottle baby kitten to urinate?,"I’m fostering two kittens (about 2 weeks old) for a local shelter. One of them pees with stimulation every time. I haven’t been able to get the other to do the same. I’ve had them for a little over 24 hours now. 

I’m in contact with their case manager at the shelter who doesn’t seem overly concerned about the situation. But I feel like it can’t be normal to be putting formula in every 3 hours and getting almost no pee, especially when the other one goes like clockwork. 

They warned me it was difficult to get her to go. Their tips have included wetting the Kleenex with warm water and holding her bits under some warm water (but then I fear that if she DOES go that way, I won’t be able to tell due to the running water). I sit and gently stim with her for minutes at a time and she just never goes and gets more and more irritable about the process. Any other ideas? There’s a lot online about helping kittens poop (which neither of them are really doing either) but less about if they’re not really peeing.",2023-05-28 07:49:49
Dog owners haven't come to get their dog- what to do?,"UPDATE: I called the local shelter and they said if we could get a written agreement from the owners of ownership then she's ours. So we went to the owners and asked and they surrendered her to us! We have a new doggo, and that precious pup has a new happy home! 

2 days ago my neighbor found a dog in front of his house. He called the number on the collar to which the owners responded they would pick her up but never did. The next day he had figured out where the dog came from and even tried to put her back in her yard because he needed to go to work and the owners weren't responding. Unfortunately she promptly got out again.

 He left the dog with me in case the owners came and got her (I would be home all day). Im generally skeptical of dogs, but this dog was really sweet and i genuinely liked her a lot. They didn't come until late morning and were not thankful or apologetic about the fact that two strangers cared for their dog for nearly 20 hours, nor did they seem worried even! 

Anyways, I was a little sad to see her go but a few hours later I saw her out again and brought her back into my home, but this time her collar was missing. I've notified the owners that i have her again but they haven't responded - again. This would be the second night she wasn't home and they don't even seem concerned! 

I'm not sure what to do next. I honestly would keep her if they don't want her, but I don't want to be a dog thief. Should I bring her to her house? Should I keep trying to contact the owners? Should I ask straight up if they don't want her? 

I would appreciate any and all advice! Thanks!",2023-05-26 18:28:17
My pet turtle escaped and came back after two years,"Just wanted share this because of how mind blown I am right now , so I had/have a pet turtle that I got when I was a kid and have taken care of it over the years, from childhood to adulthood I’ve owned and cared for this turtle. Growing up my parents didn’t let me have my turtle inside because they said stunk up the house so I ended up setting up an outdoor aquarium  in our front porch area one day I go outside to feed my turtle and It’s not there. This was my fault because I filled up its tank with too much water, so the only explanation I have is it managed to climb out. so I looked for this turtle for days on end after about two weeks I give up looking for it and just accepted that it’s gone for good. Fast forward two years later I wake up like any other morning I go outside to feed my dogs and their usually excited to see me because they know it’s time to eat but this time both my dogs distracted with something in the corner of a fence in my backyard they are barking and sniffing at it. I go take a look and I can’t believe what I’m fucking seeing,it’s my damn turtle I have no idea how it survived my best guess is it got into the canal/waterway that runs behind our backyard it Carries water pretty much year round but some times it’s completely dry. But it had no signs of injuries,struggle or that it had a hard time finding food in fact she had gotten way bigger than the last time I saw her. By this point I have long sold all of my turtle equipment including the  tank so now I’m going on a turtle shopping spree buying everything I need because my turtle decided to come back after two years of being missing  for some reason",2023-05-25 15:41:19
How to get rid of fleas before bringing a kitten into my home?,"I'm looking into getting a kitten from somebody I know, but she currently has fleas. There's two dogs, and a rabbit that currently live with me and I don't want to bring a new animal into the house and burden anybody else with the responsibility of getting rid of fleas. The dogs and rabbit aren't on flea medication because where we live it's never been a problem. The kitty is about 8 weeks old. I feel there's no way to fully get rid of the fleas until she's in my home and I can take care of her, get her an appointment set up, bathe her, etc.  I don't want to risk the other animals that live here, so if anyone can offer me any advice on how I can fully, and safely get this precious kitty rid of fleas that would be super helpful.",2023-05-25 02:26:18
Is it wrong to ask for specific vet tech not to see my cats anymore?,"I have 2 cats. Felix is 6 and Pancake is 13. Pancake is rescued and has a lot of health issues plus anger issues. She is on meds for her anger and health issues. 
Felix is very healthy, lively and chaotic but also very fat. 
We love our vet, they usually get us in quickly, cheap but good care, and the staff is amazing besides a tech named Amber. 
She hates Pancake. I mean she’s mean to her, and just plain rude to me when I bring pancake in, which is 1-2 times a month. She has causes health issues to Pancake by not reading notes in her file and I addressed this with Amber but she walked away from me. 
But she is obsessed with Felix. I mean she has mentioned how badly she would want to bring Felix home with her, asking me how much I paid for Felix, saying how amazing and handsome he is, etc. when ever I bring both cats in at the same time, she says “I call Felix!!” 
She also gives out misinformation about how often I need to give cats care. Like I asked her how often cats need dental cleaning, she said every 5 years. But a week later I asked the vet and she said every year. That’s a big difference. She also shamed me for not treating my cats for fleas and I freaked out thinking I needed something more than the prescribed medication for fleas and I had a freak out with the vet who calmed me down and said I was doing it perfectly and nothing else was needed.

"When you find a pet, how do you verify the owner?","This morning when walking my dog, I found a cat. The cat came out of the bushes and sat down the street staring at me and meowing. I took my dog home and went back to see if the cat was still there, it was and continued to meow until I approached it.

I checked the groups and there seem to be a couple people looking for a cat with this description. I let them know I may have found their cat and can send video/pics but (maybe I’m just a pessimist) how do you actually verify if that’s the correct owner? Any good questions?

1 year old kitty fainting?,"This is something that has just recently started happening. Wednesday I heard my kitty running in the hallway like she normally does and then I hear a loud screech/yowl and I go out and she is laying on her side. She is limp and unconscious and her tongue is out and doesn't look to be breathing. I pat her back alittle for a few mintues and she wakes up and wobbles down the stairs. I rush her to the emergency vet and she looks fine now they run tests and her glucose is a little high but they say that can be from the stress and her liver alt is high. They send us to the cardiologist and they runs scans and ultrasounds and tests and everything is fine with her heart but she does have a flow murmur.
She was fine on Thursday and then around 3pm on Friday she is playing and going wild with her brother and then she yowls again and passes out again. We rush her to the emergency vet again and she's fine by the time she's there. They ran a thyroid test which came back normal but they wanna run a bile acid test next for her elevevated liver. The past two days since Friday she looks to be off and sad but we do have her confined to one room so she doesn't over exert herself and pass out again. I'm afraid something is wrong with her heart that they missed or something like an irregular heart beat when she is running and exercising.

"The story of Wendy, the escape artist dog who found her way home.","Many years ago, a dog was found in the Jerusalem City Zoo trying to steal meat from the predators prep kitchen. According to her microchip, her name was Wendy, and the city found that she had run away from her owners so many times that they had cause to confiscate her for neglect. My close friend, who then worked at the zoo, was the one who found her.

At the time, I was a very active volunteer at the local animal rescue group, so I got her taken under the group's care. Wendy was absolutely an escape artist. She was placed with several different Foster families that she escaped from, until finally I took her on, as I was known to have a completely escape proof home (3 meter fence, etc) because I board dogs professionally and also was the city's expert at finding and retrieving lost and stolen pets, and advising families with escape artist pets on how to prevent them from escaping.

She remained my foster for several months, and every week I would take her to the adoption fair on Fridays, in the hope that a family would be interested in adopting her. Of course, any family that was interested in adopting her had to go through a rigorous screening, as we were very concerned about her escaping and potentially getting hit by a car or worse.

A few months in, a young couple came to the adoption fair looking to adopt their first pet. They were looking around and then they noticed our protagonist. The young lady asked one of the managers what the dog's name was. He said Wendy and she burst into tears. She told us about how when she was 17 she had found this puppy, and taken care of her for months, and called her Wendy. But then it came time for her to join the Army, and she was forced to give the dog up to a family who she lost touch with. Now, 5 years later, she came to this adoption fair to adopt, and found her first dog, her Wendy.

The manager was very skeptical and walked up to me and told me the story, not really believing any of it. You have to understand when you work in a rescue you hear all kinds of crazy shit, and meet all kinds of absolutely insane people. Still, it seemed possible. Wendy wasn't totally into the whole thing - she didn't object to the attention, but she seemed kinda stressed - though she HATED adoption fairs (too chaotic), and was stressed out already, so that might have been it.

The young woman later supplied photos proving that Wendy was her dog from years back, and was quickly approved to adopt her after getting guidance for me on how to prevent her from escaping and an engraved metal name tag in case she did. When she came to my home to collect Wendy (two days after the fair), Wendy was VERY happy to see her. It was kinda a ""where have you been?"" moment.

I kept in touch with the young lady for several years. She told me that Wendy never once tried to escape after she brought her home. I like to think that all the times she tried to escape she was just trying to find her way home, and now she finally had and had no reason to run away.

I wonder if I still have Wendy's owner's number. Wendy is probably deceased by now, but I'd like to know that she had a good life.",2023-05-13 00:37:05
Triggered my street cat's PTSD. Dropped her water dish with a water bottle and she attacked me viciously,"I rescued her about 6 months ago - she was so weak she couldn't stand, and had to be hand fed the first week because she literally couldn't move. Anywho, full recovery. Now, she has a 3 week old kitten that she had in my house. She has been the friendliest girl for the last 5-6 months. She let me play with the kitten whenever I wanted. I was getting her water, and she was inbetween my feet. I dropped the bottle. She didn't get hit by it, but it was right near the door to the room with her kitten. She was seemingly immediately fine with it, sniffing the water. I picked up the water bottle and started walking to the bathroom then got attacked from behind aggressively (like multiple deep scratches and bites). I quickly grabbed the comforter to my bed and wrapped her up. I put her in the room with the kitten and then finally she started meowing normally instead of yowling. I let her out, she was friendly with me

Then, ironically, 20 minutes later as I was cleaning all the bites and scrapes with iodine, and she bumped into the chair that had the bottle of iodine on it...

Which landed right next to her and made her flip and try to attack me again. This time I was ready as I was carrying a towel with me just in case she lost it again lmao. So I gave her some canned food, she yowled at me, yowled some more, and then I guided her to the room with the kitten and locked her in there.

I am leaving her with my mom which has me somewhat concerned because I don't want her attacking my mother as well.

ANYWHO - any advice what to do? Is this a wait it out scenario or how do I rebuild her trust in me?",2023-05-12 11:24:41
Adopting a cat whose owner died,"My partner has a client who died, leaving behind a 5-year old tortoiseshell cat. 

All I know is that the owner died of an IV drug overdose, leaving behind a hoarder situation and a cat. I’ve been told she is skittish and the room she was left in smells strongly of cat urine. Otherwise, we know nothing. 

I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on making the introduction to our home more comfortable for her. Thanks!

Edit: I got the vaccination records and it turns out that I knew the owner. The universe has been weird like that lately.. I contacted the person who introduced me to the owner and they have a bag of clothes that should have the owner’s scent. I also now know that the cat was the owner’s #1 priority and when comfortable, she’s a sweetheart.

My dog and I have our own version of sign language and it’s so cute 🥹,"My dog has lost her hearing over the years. So instead of yelling at her because I don’t like yelling at her, she’s an old girl, and she can’t hear me. I started making hand signals that she understood very quickly. It is the cutest thing. 

All I have to do is point and she knows. When I tell her it’s time to go, I put my fingers in a circular movement and then point to the door. Then if she starts to go the wrong way, I’ll point, she’ll look at me, and then she’ll go the right way. It’s likes we have DSL (dog sign language) 😂. 

I just wanted to share. She is such a good girl and one of the best dogs I’ve ever met. She doesn’t bark and she doesn’t do dog things. She’s like my little dog cat 😂.

Edit:

I want to clarify. We don’t yell at her on a daily or regular basis. In the beginning we did not understand why she wasn’t hearing us and would either raise our voices a little or stomp on the ground to feel the vibrations. 

Now that WE KNOW she can’t hear us, we came up with a solution. We no longer raise our voices because we know now. I never liked to raise my voice, but it was purely out of concerns. Sometimes she can’t hear us whistle when she goes potty so we either yell a little or go out looking for her in the dark. We have a gated fence and a BIG backyard so she can play in. 

My ole girl is going blind, deaf, and has arthritis. We love her to death and take good care of her. She is ONE OF the sweetest dogs ever and I don’t think I’ll ever get another dog after she is gone. 

We rescued her from an abused home, so please don’t think that we are being cruel to her. We now understand she is deaf and found a solution for her comfort.

Sad Update:

I wanted to let everyone know that our sweet girl past away today. She was in so much pain and the vet told us it was time. She lived a long and fabulous 15 years and we couldn’t miss her more. She passed peacefully in her own home, in her own bed. My mom and I are heart broken and my cat is wandering the house looking for her buddy. It was such a relief to see my baby at peace and no longer in pain. She was such a great girl and couldn’t of asked for a better dog. Our angel doggy and our sweet girl. Hope she knew how much we loved her and how much we care for her. I hope wherever she is, that she is with family. She was the best damn dog ever and it feels like a piece of my soul was ripped from my chest. I want to cry way more than I have already, but I’m so exhausted. I’m here laying in my bed, typing this, watching Godzilla movies to take my mind off it 😂 😭. She IS the bestest girl. 

And whoever said she deserved to have arthritis and hard hearing, I know I blocked u, BUT F YOU!!

How much time should be spent with an adult cat?,"My roommate has a cat that they’re never home to be with—they spend every night at their partner’s home, and when they are home they often lock the cat out of their room because he’s “being annoying.” The “annoying” behavior (constant meowing, not leaving their side, getting into everything, etc) is just due to separation anxiety IMO. A lot of the time they just come in for 30 seconds-a minute to feed him and then leave immediately. They’re inconsistent with the cat’s flea treatments so I’m not comfortable letting him in my room, and I’m not home very often either, but I’m also not the one who committed to a pet when I didn’t have the time for it. We have a third roommate who isn’t home very often and has a small dog which she takes everywhere with her, and she also doesn’t feel comfortable with the cat in her room.

New dogs not getting along,"This week we brought a new dog home, a 2yo male pug rescue (Rocco). We have an 8yo female terrier (Pip) already and she's lived alone all her life.

Pip doesn't seem happy at all, she snaps at him and doesn't want anything to do with him. This is I guess to be expected considering he's new to her territory.

However, one thing I don't understand is that she has started growling and barking in reaction to any noise, people coming into the room or us playing with the new dog. If we give out to her she snarls.
She has never behaved like this before and would never growl at any of us.

Does anyone have any experience with this sort of behaviour? Or have any idea of what she's going through and how to help?

"Our 9YO Female passed due to cancer, and her brother now seems ""lonely"". Should we try to get him a new companion? It's a bit complicated...","Note: Apologies for leaving this out detail previously, this is about a pair of cats.

My wife and I had a brother and sister from the same litter, and we just recently had to euthanize the sister due to cancer at 9 years old. Now the brother seems to be clinging to us much more than he used to, and I feel bad because we're out of the house most of the day (we're typically only home early mornings and evenings, and frequently away on the weekends). We don't have any children or anyone else in the house.

The brother was also a bit of a bully to the sister while she was alive, picking fights with her and eating her food, which might make things ""complicated"" in terms of finding him a new companion.

Would it be a good idea to try to find a new cat to take her place since we're gone from the house so much? I'm assuming a kitten wouldn't be a good idea due to his bullying tendencies, but I'm open to any ideas you all think would help.

Edit to add: Thank you all SO much for the support and ideas so far, I've shared these all with my wife as well and we're grateful for all the love for us and our girl. Please give yours an extra hug for us. ",2023-05-03 21:50:45
Any advice for my friends and their new stray cat? The original owner is asking for it back but they seem potentially dangerous.,"UPDATE: unfortunately, Sushi has been returned to their original owner. C has reimbursed S for the vaccination, food and the time they spent caring it. However, there are a few notes that may see Sushi either be given back to S or just given a better home elsewhere. C has to attend a microchip appointment this coming week and the RSPCA has arranged to go to C's home the following week for a checkup. If she misses either appointment, it's likely Sushi will be removed from C's care. On top of that, C has continued to harass S about the kitten and claiming it hasn't been given back, despite them, you know, GIVING IT BACK! They are making it very clear that if she doesn't stop, they're going to the police for harassment and animal abuse which could give C a $20 000 fine. Personally, I'm hoping she doesn't show up for the appointment so Sushi can be given a safer home, but I'm not hopeful. Thank you to all of you and your responses.


So, last Saturday (29/4/2023), my group of friends (let's call them S, A and H) found a stray kitten in their garage. They took it to be chipped and found that it had not been chipped and looked around local missing animal posts in their area but didn't find anything, so S decided on Monday to take it for health checks and officially adopt it into their apartment. The kitten hadn't been vaccinated and was a bit undernourished from neglect, and likely would've died if they hadn't found it. S paid for vaccination and has been taking care of the kitten, now called Sushi, for the past 5 days. Today (3/5/2023), the original owner has contacted them.

The original owner, which we will refer to as ""Crackhead"" (C) as that's how she was described to me, had been asking around about it since yesterday (2/5). Eventually, she asks the business in which S works. S's boss took C's details and passed them onto S (Boss did not inform C she knew who had the kitten, just said ""I'll keep an eye open""). S has since called C about Sushi. Apparently, she admitted herself into a mental unit in the local hospital on Friday night and dumped the kitten on her way ""with the intention of coming back for it once she leaves"". Due to the state the kitten was found in and how long it took for C to look for it, my friends don't want to give it back for its safety. However, they're also worried for their own safety due to C's mental issues and... Well they refer to her as Crackhead for a reason. They've gone to the police with their concerns, and whilst they've been informed that they have no legal obligations to give the cat back due to the state it was found in, the police have said they can't get a restraining order since there's been no actual ""threat"" posed against them.

A is furious at the idea of giving Sushi back. S and H are worried that S might get jumped at work if they don't. So far, they've told C that she'd have to pay them for the vaccinations and for the time they've spent feeding and caring for it. C has apparently said they will pay but we still do not trust them to take care of Sushi. They've also informed the RSPCA about it and apparently there's very little they can do. Does anyone have any advice on how we can ensure this precious kitty remains safe and that S's wellbeing is not being threatened? I've been told the internet loves cats so I would appreciate any tips to ensure this one survives in a loving home. In Australia BTW.

EDIT: I should also mention this kitten is less than a year old (about 8 months I'm told). So this crackhead leaves this kitten abandoned with no food in the middle of a random suburb and expects it to not only still be there when she gets back from a psych ward but also expects it to be alive! She's also claiming it's a mental health pet but I don't believe you can get a practically newborn animal as a mental health companion, at least in Australia.

REEDIT: I should also add that Sushi appears to be a Siberian which are normally pretty damn pricey.",2023-05-03 20:03:32
Kitten advice. A stray I feed just brought her litter over.,"I've raised plenty of puppies, taken care of roommates cats over the years. I know I have to find a good home for them but I might bring one inside. I've never raised a kitten, what are some tips? Potty training,  ect, ect....

Kittens can walk and are about 3 weeks old. I would not take them from the mom till they eat solid food. And they would be a indoor out door cat. 

The mom is feral. I can pick her up, hold her, brush her, and give her kisses. But she wants to be a outdoor cat. She lives in my back/front yard going on a year now. I have no idea how old she is or where she came from. The only thing I know Is that my neighbors have dogs and don't feed any cats. She has no collar, and I have never seen a ""missing cat"" poster.",2023-05-03 08:52:29
I’m not ready to lose my dog,"So I’m tearing up writing this but I really just need an outlet to share how I’m feeling.

About a month ago we noticed a bump on the top of my dogs head. We thought it was just a bruise from something falling on him or him bumping into him since he has cataracts and can’t really see.

After a month the bump never decreased in size so we took him to the vet last week Monday. He was terrified and couldn’t stop shaking and the vet wasn’t able to get a good look on the sonogram so we’re still unsure what it is.

That night my dog suffered a seizure. Not knowing at the time that it was a seizure and it happening at 1:30am, we were very scared. He had no balance and fell off the bed.

He was showing signs of improvement, regaining his balance, jumping on the couch, and we were optimistic it was a minor episode.

On Sunday we noticed he was back to walking in circles and having a hard time getting to where he wanted to go.

That night, he suffered from a seizure cluster, with 3 in a 6 hour period. This time knowing it was happening I was able to hold him and prevent him from hurting himself.

I take him back to the vet yesterday and given the symptoms, the vet is confident his bump is a brain tumor. We’re praying that the bump isn’t such, and that the circles are caused by vestibular disease. He’s on anti seizure medicine and antibiotics. 

The hardest part is this: the medicine should take 3 days to work and show improvement. If he doesn’t improve then we can only assume it is a brain tumor and all the symptoms are cancer related.

So I have 3 days to see if my dog is dying and it’s so fucking hard to watch. I just love this guy so much. We rescued him in 2018 and we don’t even know how old he is (we know he’s at least 11 but we think he’s 13 or 14)

If you’re still reading this, thank you. I just need an outlet to share and just to cry a bit. I’m just praying this medicine works and I’m back to playing with him next week. I’m sorry for the disorganized post I just spewed all the info as it made sense it my head. 

Please give all of your pets and hug and a kiss today because you never know when it’s going to end.

Buddy, I love you so freaking much! I’m not ready to say goodbye 😭😭

Edit: I just want to thank all of you for your kind words and support it really means a lot to me. Unfortunately I’m beginning to lose my optimism as he’s been having a lot of accidents to the point that I bought him diapers this morning. I have a feeling a very difficult decision is coming but it won’t be that difficult because he’s not himself and his quality of life is deteriorating. He’ll be absolutely spoiled over the next few days with hugs, kisses, treats, and probably a steak 🥩",2023-05-03 02:15:45

Does anyone else shadowbox with their cats?,"This is such a stupid ""inner turmoil"" thing I can't stop thinking of. TL;DR at the bottom.

**TW:** references to animal abuse (but not any actual abuse)

I love shadowboxing with my cats, especially my youngest (""Sassafras"" 8F) who is extremely playful and energetic. 

To be specific, I will ""dukes up"" in front of my cat, I will jab lightly without any impact whatsoever while making ""pow, pow"" sounds, and I will ""punch them in slow-motion"" (my ""punches"" have less impact than a normal pet on the head would, I cannot stress enough that I am not *actually* punching my cats). Half the time my cats will lean into my ""punches"" and rub their heads into my knuckles for a good scritch. Other times, particularly with Sassafras, she will get on her hind legs and put her paws up, bap at my fists, and it turns into a full-on play brawl.

Anyway, I took Sassafras to the vet last week for her shots. There was a new assistant there and she was very young so she may have been fresh out of school. I was keeping my cat entertained in the exam room while waiting and making my ""pow pow"" noises when she comes in. She gestured to the window on the door she came through and said, ""That's really not a good way to play with a cat.""

She began talking about how bad overstimulation was for them and how I was teaching them that physical abuse was healthy and normal. I assured her I wasn't abusing my cats and it was just play fighting. She shrugged and said, ""It's just a good way to make your pets fear you. The vet will be right in."" 

I was pretty livid, but also a bit embarrassed. The Karen in me wanted to bring this up to the vet, but the neurotic in me started to think ""Oh god, what if she's right?""

I've been thinking about it for a few days and flipping back and forth on it for the sake of considering my animals' well-being. But The fact is, I've had cats my entire life and even if there are multiple people in the house, I've always been ""their person."" Sassafras loves playing with me and she is in bed with me every night and follows me around everywhere. I call her my little ""goldfish turd."" She doesn't display any signs of ""fear love."" And it's making me think the vet assistant has maybe misinterpreted something she'd recently learned in a class and then took it as gospel. And, while I love my cats, I just don't think they're capable of that level of complex emotion. If I did something that scared them they'd be scared.

**TL;DR:** A green vet assistant scolded me for shadowboxing my cats as it would cause them to fear me and normalize abuse. So I guess now I'm either looking for validation from others who also play fight with their pets or, I guess, to have the assistant's suggestion validated and I should reconsider this playstyle for the sake of my cats.",2023-05-01 00:11:20
My roommate wants to leave her cat alone for 4 months,"My roommate is going to China for vacation from today till late August and she has left her British short hair cat alone in her room to stay there till August. 

She has arranged for her friend to visit 3 times a week to feed the cat and change his litter. He has a water fountain so he will always have water. Is that enough?

For deeper context, the cat isn’t even allowed in the apartment (no pet policy) and she has been keeping him illegally and no one wants the cat rooming around in the living room/kitchen so the cat will be confined to a room most of the time. 

What can I do in this situation? I will try to keep the cat company but I am going on vacation soon and won’t be back till june. 

Should we call peta? Report to the building managers etc. any advice would be great! 

Thanks in advance.",2023-04-30 04:03:06
"Adopted a cat at the local shelter (5m, Female)","PS AT THE BOTTOM

I picked her up at around 12pm today and she's been hiding underneath my bed and around the room since. She barely ate anything from what I've noticed or drank any water I placed out for her. I bought the Purina Kitten Chow since that's what she was eating at the shelter and was told to continue her on that so I don't get a poopy kitty from their sensitive stomachs but it doesn't seem like she's interested. I did have the kitten churu's and she ate 2 of those but otherwise nothing else really. She didn't react to any of the catnip I had nearby either. I left for work overnight so she's alone for the night. 

Should I be concerned?

Ps. 
-When I put food near her, she makes this chewing sound and motion 🤷‍♀️
-She was spayed yesterday. 
-She was a stray and at the shelter for about a month
-I'm also going to be bringing her to a clinic to be seen soon.",2023-04-29 09:35:13

My cat loves vegetables. Is that weird/unhealthy?,"My cat absolutely loves green beans, and things like spinach/collard/mustard/turnip greens..

She doesn't care if they are seasoned with meat ingredients like broth or bacon or anything, she likes them plain just as much.. As long as the veggies are at least blanched and not totally raw (easier to chew) she loves them. Begs for them, even. 😹

I make sure she doesn't eat onion or raw garlic since I've heard they are toxic to cats.

But I was just wondering, does anyone else's cat like veggies as much as mine does? Or is she just special? 😹 And is it unhealthy for cats to eat vegetables as a treat?",2023-04-28 01:59:08

Fleas or no fleas,"This is more about a disagreement between me and my husband, but I am wondering if this has happened to others. 

My husband lost his job in January and decided to breed our Frenchie and take on another Frenchie to breed in order to bring in some income. This was much to my dismay as I had already told us our home did not have the capacity for another dog, nor did I. 
While caring for the dogs, he has also been grieving his job loss as there are not many available right now for him in his field due to the change in the economy. I have tried to be reasonable and understanding about this. However, about 3 weeks ago he came to me overly stressed out exclaiming that the dogs all had fleas. He said they had been scratching all day and night and that he's pulled several fleas off all of them, they're all over the furniture and the dog beds, and that he had bites all over himself. 
I admittedly was not super receptive to this at first as I work a swing shift and he woke me up very early to show me the fleas he'd pulled off of them. When I was finally awake, I looked the dogs over and found nothing. I was with them during the whole morning before I worked and saw only one dog scratch once. I have not gotten any bites, either. I did give them a flea and tick treatment, just preventatively since we are coming into spring.  
Our dog has had fleas before, I've treated them, seen them, felt them on me, but I truly see nothing now. What he brings to me looks like scabs he pulled off from dry skin and not like fleas. He still thinks they are leaving me alone because of something I'm putting on my skin like lotion. He's tried spraying our house with garlic and vinegar to get rid of them. 
My husband keeps telling me I'm wrong about there being no fleas and is accusing me of gaslighting him. I offered to pay for a vet visit, but he said with the infestation, he doesn't have time to take them. I don't have time because I am constantly cleaning up after his efforts to curb the ""flea"" outbreak.  This has been going on for 3 weeks. 
I just got home from a trip and my house is a disaster because he keeps pulling things out to ""treat"" the dogs but doesn't put anything away. He keeps bagging up clothing, blankets, and dog beds, but doesn't wash anything and lets everything to just pile up. 
He says he reads dog forums and it's common for one person to see fleas while their partner does not (according to others in this forum). My overall question is, does this really occur and has anyone else experienced it? I just need to try to find some benefit of the doubt for my husband. 

TL;DR, my husband thinks that couples can be divided on seeing fleas in their dogs. Is that true?",2023-04-25 18:05:49
Do I really need to have $5k in reserves to be a responsible dog owner?,"I was told that if you only have enough money to buy a dog, you don’t have enough money to buy a dog. Basically you need to also think of toys and food and medical bills and training if necessary, etc etc. 

Totally fair. I agree. 

But then I was told that being able to afford only like a hundred or two in emergency medical care isn’t enough. That it’s irresponsible and if you can’t afford to address a major health crisis for your pet, you shouldn’t be owning one. 

Fair enough again I thought, so I promoted for how much you should reliably be able to drop on an emergency expense to be considered a responsible dog owner. 

And the answer this group sort of landed on was $5k. 

Which, ok, that’s cool I guess. But something like 40% of the country is living paycheck to paycheck and has less than a grand in savings. If the benchmark to be a responsible pet owner really is about $5k in reserves ear marked for the pet, then you are taking what should be, or at least what I always thought of as being, one of the great universal joys in life that transcends socio-economic status and many other social divisions, and you’ve made it into a hobby only for well to do. And that seems really crappy to me. 

But that group was sort of an…..extreme group….about their pets. 

So I figured I’d run this story by this more generalized group. What do you all think? How much money should you have in reserves to be a responsible dog owner.",2023-04-25 04:59:36

I couldn't afford to treat him the vet visit costed me over 600, all I could do was get one of the medications and the blood test done for him. The medicine he's on is called denamarin 100mg. They weren't worried about diabetes but didn't give me many answers after that, to be honest that vet was very uncomfortable to talk to and just not understanding the situation he wouldn't even let me go back with him. He's regained his appetite before I started the medication he did pee and poop last night when I took him to the vet but I haven't noticed him going recently. He's moving around slightly but is still heavily lathagic and wants to stay in the same spot. I'm not sure what to do since I can't afford the vet until next Monday when I get paid.

Sleeping arrangements with cat and baby," So, we have a cat, and I'm 25 weeks, so looking into living  arrangements.

Anyways, after that dog, they got their latest, a similar pit bull to the first two. However, the woman who owns them seemingly started working nights because she’s gone all night and asleep all day. She keeps the dog tied up outside all day and he is barking CONSTANTLY and she never comes to check on him and I’ve never seen him be fed. He also has no water bowl outside and it’s starting to get hot. Overnight, I think he’s kept in a locked room upstairs while she works because I hear him barking inside until 1 or 2am. I’m concerned for the animal and starting to go insane from the barking but I don’t know what to do about it. Is there somewhere in particular I should report this?",2023-04-21 00:47:41

Is it okay for a cat to eat blended food?,"We recently adopted a cat, who will soon be two years old. In the beginning she ate anything just fine. The previous owner never had an issue getting her to eat, regardless of brand, as long as it was bits in gravy.

She was a bit underweight when we got her, but the vet was very happy with the diet we put her on to get it up a bit.
She has been fully on wet food three times a day, essentially since she moved in, because she lost interest in the dry food as soon as she could get enough wet food to be full.

Last week she stopped eating her food entirely. We tried everything and spoke with two separate vets, with no results. She showed interest in her food, but turned away after sniffing it or licking up some of the gravy and would spit out the bits if they got in her mouth.

Because of that, I tried blending it, and it worked wonders! She now gets all the calories she needs in proper food. But is it really okay for her to only eat blended food? Will i hve to try and work her back to the bits?


(Her teeth are in perfect condition and she will still accept crunchy snacks and chewy raw meat. She got the all clear from the vet 3 weeks ago with bloodtests and everything, so I don't expect her to be ill)",2023-04-20 21:06:22

Chewing issue,"Adopted a senior dog and he chews on everything. Dresser draws. Toys. Bouncy balls? The dog beds. Sticks. He snuck a stick in the house and got wood chunks everywhere. He doesn't seem to be swallowing anything just chewing. Never had to deal with this problem before.

"My Cat Has Heartworms and IBD or GI Cancer, Paid $2,300 so far with $3,000 on the way and another $3,000 potential-- idk if she will die either way","This story is ridiculous and exhausting. I am so tired, I don't know how to make a decision right now. 

So, my cat had a vomiting episode last week with high respirations, bloody diarrhea and was in intense pain. I brought her to the emergency department and they said that she probably had a syncopal episode and maybe a heart attack. They asked us if we had any idea what could have happened. I told them we had poison mouse traps in the house (the tomcat ones that are ""child and pet safe"" because they are self contained) and I sent them a picture. They ran a bunch of tests then just decided to treat her for a rat poison that causes bleeding without really considering the labs they just took or the picture of the poison we sent them.

They started her on vitamin k and passed her off to our regular vet to continue the treatment plan. Our vet continued to give vitamin k and fluids. Our cat kept vomiting, not eating, and having bloody stool. Her clotting time was increasing (from 8 sec when she arrived to 13 min 24 hours later) and they couldn't figure it out. They decided to call poison control (mind you, this is the first time either vet had reached out to them) and they were told that tomcat products were actually Bromethalin (a neurotoxin) and if she started to develop seizures she should be euthanized because there is no cure. The vet kept assuring me she would be okay because she had not had any signs of seizures. I was still concerned because of her continued bleeding and diarrhea. I finally got the poison control number from them yesterday and called. I explained everything and they put me in touch with a toxicologist that said there was no way that she could have been poisoned by either on of the poisons because if a mouse had eaten it, there would not have been enough bioavailability for her to get that sick (additionally, Bromethalin has nothing to do with bleeding). Overall we paid $2,300 for all of that time wasted.

So, we picked her up and took her to a university animal hospital last night. By this time, she hadn't eaten in a week and had lost at least 2 pounds (she was 13 to begin with). We signed an agreement to pay anywhere from $2,000-$3,000 there for treatment. They called today and said she has hearworms and either GI cancer or irritable bowel disease (IBD). They said if we stop diagnostic testing now and just monitor her (because her heartworm symptoms may resolve on their own) and try to treat her as though she has IBD, she may live and we will stay within the 2-3k range. But, they want to do an Echo of her heart so that they can check its strength to see if she if she could go under general anesthesia for a biopsy. This would be an additional $3,000. And even if we do all that, it might not make a difference. 

They did say she is eating a little because they are giving her pain meds and appetite stimulants, so that is good, but I am still worried about everything overall.

The worst part of this is that about 1-2 years ago our dog had heartworms and I was concerned for our cat. Our vet said that cats don't get heartworms and disregarded this. On another visit, I had told them I was concerned that her stomach seemed firm and distended. They said it was just gas and not to worry about it.

What do I do?",2023-04-19 06:17:53
Dogs do NOT have emotions,"I have a small dog, she's great and I love her.  

However, I also have a husband who will not believe that our dog has any feelings whatsoever.  I find it unbelievable that a man in his 50's doesn't understand that dogs have emotions, though they are of a less complicated, more basic nature than those of humans.

What do you think?  Am I wrong?  Is my husband wrong?  And if he is wrong, what does that say about him?  

He has never understood what is important to me and I constantly have to protect the emotions of my daughter from him.

Help

Edited to say:
1. I have both a daughter and a dog.  This was causing some confusion 😁
2. For many years I have blamed myself for how little he cares about me and my feelings. I have always thought that it was me/my fault. 

However, with the little information I have given in my original post, it would seem that there is an obvious (to everyone else except me) alternative.  It may not be my fault....

Desperate - Need a food alternative!,"Hello fellow fur parents, 

I come here on my knees, in search of advice and suggestions, after I have done my research. I'll try to explain while keeping it short.

I have two Furs, ages 4 and 5 who have grown up on Purina pro plan since kitten hood. Since the pandemic, whatever has happened with the formula is noticeable to these picky ones and they are not pleased! I have tried so many different brands and I don't know what to do. At the end of March, I noticed the 6 year old gagging. Thinking it was a lodged hairball, we ran to the vet, who believes he had nausea and a possible kidney infection. Urine sample later found crystals so I know his diet will have to change. Meds have been working but now I went to feed him tonight and he is gagging again. As if the tuna flavor is poison! I am going on vacation next week and don't want him to starve. I know that they specialty brands require vet approval (Chewy) and we are in the process of finding a new doctor (unprofessional, no availability, extremely high turnover/red flag). I am also tired of wasting money and not finding a worthy alternative. 

I know they all have their own likes/dislikes but what have you tried that has worked?

Any help will be greatly appreciated. I am desperate and will do anything for them.

Thank you",2023-04-16 09:31:20

STOP STEALING PETS AND CLAIMING IT’S “RESCUING” THEM!,"I see these posts all the time and they are infuriating as a person whose dog went missing for 32 days. Our very-beloved dog slipped out of our yard during a family event and the people who found him RIGHT OUTSIDE OUR HOUSE decided to just keep him. They could have taken him to get his microchip scanned and he would have been home in minutes. Instead, they told themselves they were “rescuing” a dog. 

We spent thousands of dollars and 32 sleepless nights relentlessly searching for our dog before someone finally located him through Facebook. When the police got involved, they told us we could press charges against the supposed “rescuers” for PROPERTY THEFT. We didn’t want them charged but I want people to know that “finders keepers” is THEFT when it comes to keeping animals that aren’t yours. The RIGHT way to handle this is to take ANY vet or police station to get the microchip scanned. That could find the owner instantly. If that doesn’t work, surrender to the shelter. Let THEM handle reunification or adoption. 

Stop convincing yourselves there’s anything benevolent about dog theft. You are not judge and jury. The law is not in your favor.",2023-04-12 10:11:41

Do NOT go to Banfield Pet Hospital,"I’m not sure if this post is allowed here and if it needs to be deleted by mods, that is completely okay and understandable.

I am a current employee at Banfield Pet Hospital and wanted to share my current experiences.

If you truly love your pet and want to receive the best medical care for them, do NOT go to Banfield Pet Hospital.

I plan on leaving this job soon and the rest of my coworkers are in the process of putting in their two weeks, searching for other jobs, or are INSANELY unhappy. One of my coworkers even stated that she promised that she would never practice bad medicine, and here she is, practicing bad medicine.

This corporate does not give two shits about its employees, clients, or animals. The culture of my current clinic is terrible and has been an ongoing issue for YEARS. The staff is severely underpaid and expected of so many things. The amount of responsibilities that the VA’s have is incredible shocking, especially considering the fact that they do not have to have prior experience or a background in vet med. VA’s at Banfield do nearly the equivalent to what a vet tech does. The vet techs get fucked over and are pushed to the max with their own panels as they arent given extra assistance and expected to do things on their own. Doctors and surgery VA’s hardly get a lunch break. We are overworked and pushed to reach high pet numbers everyday which severely compromises the care of your animals. I, personally, would never ever bring my pet to a Banfield after seeing the type of medical treatment and care that Banfield produces. Everyone is insanely burnt out. Double booking new pets is acceptable as they are attempting to put more pets on wellness plans.

Speaking of the wellness plans, that is all that they push for and all that we are praised for. I did not join to sell wellness plans, I joined for the genuine care and love of animals. Please, I beg of you, if you truly love and care for your pet, do not take them here. MARS is a money hungry corporate that could give two shits about your pet and milks the most out of their employees.",2023-04-09 22:10:37

Do not buy Figo pet insurance,"Just wanted to give a PSA for a popular pet insurance. 

I bought Figo pet insurance through Costco for my cat.  It appeared to be reasonably well reviewed, and the fact that Costco sold it made me more confident that it was high quality.  

Boy was I wrong.  A number of months into the policy term, my cat was diagnosed with stomatitis, a horrible autoimmune disease that often requires extraction of all the cat's teeth.  I obtained an estimate from a local veterinary dental specialist and submitted it to Figo for preapproval.  I was thrilled to receive Figo's response, which stated that the stomatitis would not be considered an preexisting condition and may be eligible for coverage. 

The extraction went as planned, and I submitted my claim to Figo.  They denied it in less than a business day.  When I reached out to ask why, they told me that they considered the stomatitis a pre-existing condition because my cat had previously showed signs of mild gingivitis that his veterinary said was a result of the eruption of his adult teeth.  (Figo had these records when they rendered the preapproval decision.)  Apparently, Figo considers *any* sign of prior dental disease a preexisting condition for *any* subsequent dental diagnosis, which Figo did not disclose at the time I purchased the insurance.  So, for example, if your pet has even a spot of tartar or plaque noted in its medical records, it will apparently be completely ineligible for any dental illness coverage in the future.  

The Figo reps I spoke to did not care about the preapproval letter.  They noted that the preapproval letter was not a guarantee of coverage (duh, they could deny the claim for *other* reasons, just not the one they specifically ruled out).  When I asked what the point of obtaining preapproval was, the rep said ""I don't know."" 

Swell.

Anyway, don't waste your money on this trash insurance.",2023-04-08 05:12:56
"Paws, Pills and Puppy Love: Sniffling Tail of Hugs and Heartache","My daughter has been bugging us for a dog since forever. A month ago, for her birthday, after giving her the usual talk about the responsibilities of taking care of a pet, we finally gave in and got her a nice shih tzu pup. An allergic reaction never crossed our minds as something to be concerned about as she never showed any when she was in contact with other people's pets, It could be with the duration of the contact, as she spent the rest of the day hugging the puppy, carrying it around the house that day, but that night she woke us up, her face flushed and crying in between gasps of air. She's eventually recovered. We haven't had the time to visit an allergist though. My daughter has a fear of doctors and needles so my wife and I had to consider other options. We’ve tried loratadine and its variants but our daughter complained about having dizzy spells. A friend has recommended Wyndly, which offers an oral, homecare approach. We’ve given this a go, as I too, prefer the homecare approach, and it seems a better fit for her.

We had to say goodbye to sushi, her puppy's name. It broke my heart seeing her cry not wanting to give her pet away. Owning a pet could be a very enriching life experience growing up and I don't want my child robbed of that experience but maybe Wyndly would give her that chance to own a pet again.",2023-04-08 00:10:08

Is it just me or is Embrace Pet Insurance just dogs**t?,"Just a couple of weeks ago, I submitted a claim since my dog had been dealing with elevated liver enzyme levels in the last couple of months. I have been on Embrace Pet Insurance since Aug 2021 with an annual deductible of $750, and just this year so far I had spent like $1400 for the diagnosis, the liver pills, ultrasound, etc. I submitted everything only for everything to be denied, because they had cited a case of ""bloody stool"" as an underlying cause and pre-existing condition all the way back in 5/18/2021. Honestly that does not make sense AT ALL, since ""bloody stool"" would be considered a SYMPTOM and not an UNDERLYING CAUSE. Secondly how the hell would it have anything to do with his elevated enzyme levels NOW especially when it was back in May 2021?

I had also submitted a claim of dental extraction the year before, again over some BS pre-existing condition loophole.
